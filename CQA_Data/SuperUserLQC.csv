<p>Mark a list of mp3 files inside a directory, and have them all played back. </p>

<p>So, for example, I have 15 mp3 files inside a directory, I want to have them played back one at a time, automatically, without selecting a tracck after a track. </p>

<p>Is there a tool available for windows 10?</p>

<p>I tried for one hour and did not find a solution. Here is what I have tried: </p>

<ul>
<li>kodi, Plex: Did not work at all, one asked me to download a file myself, which was not there.</li>
<li>MediaPortal: Not working</li>
<li>MusicBeee: Probably codec missing</li>
<li>5kplayer: Works, BUT ONLY FOR ON GIVEN FILE AT A TIME. Unable to select a list of files...</li>
</ul>

<p>So is there a solution to my problem? I do not require video playback, and I do not need an equalizer or some other stuff. Just to be able to PLAY A LIST OF MP3 MUSIC! Argh!</p>

It was on my Sony Xperia android smartphone, I almost never removed it from the phone.
Suddenly about a month ago, the phone displayed a message saying that the card is not formatted, so I removed it from the phone and formatted it using my PC.
It was working normally until yesterday when the phone displayed a message saying that the card was removed, but it was obviously still inside the phone.
The phone is working normally with any other micro SD card.</p>

<p>I've tried inserting the card directly in the PC card reader but it won't detect anything. When I try using a USB card adapter, it shows partially as removable disk E:,but if I try to open I get a ""Please insert disk into removable disk E:"" and chkdsk is reporting ""Cannot open volume for direct access"".</p>

<p>I used the card mostly for music, but there is a couple of photos I'd like to have back. Is there anything I can do?

In order to install such configurations, we usually clone one by one each of the computers, with Norton Ghost or Clonezilla, depending on which CD we have on hand. The process is kind of slow, because the source image is actually an hard drive from another operational PC. In order to make it faster, we first have to wait for the first PC to be cloned, then we got two hard drives containing the image, so we can use both of them for imaging two other PCs, and we keep going on until every PC is imaged.</p>

<p>Now, we want to make the process faster and easier. We first thought about broadcasting the image via the network, but we are still under a 100 megabits network. Is there any other ways to make the imaging process a little bit faster?</p>

<p>Then I collected some facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Laptop was not turning on when I was pressing power button without charger connected.</li>
<li>I plugged charger pressed power button and it turned on.</li>
<li>I unplugged charger after 2-3 seconds, While it was booting (on boot loader screen) after 2 seconds it made pop sound again from the bottom of right side and turned.</li>
<li>I booted OS after charging for 1 minute and plugged off charger and while on windows boot screen display tilted to save power (I did not know Windows 10 had such display driver feature while it is still loading),</li>
<li>I plugged charger back and display was brightened up to normal state.</li>
<li>Windows wrote that battery was charging.</li>
<li>When it turned of it was kind of on 20% charged. Usually windows shuts down after it reaches 7%.</li>
<li>When it happened first time the place where hit comes out from laptop was warmer than usually while watching movie without charger plugged.</li>
</ol>

<p>Did someone had similar experience ? I think that it is related to battery. But I did not like that pop sound which might be coming from battery it feels like short circuit is happening inside while working with battery on low charge.</p>

However my father is not comfortable with me backing up my Windows machine on that server. Now I'm facing the question: Should I get myself an external storage to backup my windows on it or should I introduce my own backup system (a synology disk for example) to the homenetwork.<br>
The synology disk has multiple advantages:</p>

<li>Integrated Media Server to stream on the MacBook, the PC and the iPhone</li>
<li>Backup of all the listed devices</li>
<li>User interface to easy configure</li>
<li>I could manage a shared git on the server</li>
</ul>

<p>My only fear now is that if I catch some kind of ransomware on one of these devices, the next sync / backup will also encrypt the data on the synology disk.<br>
If one disk would be backup and the other media there would still be affected both. <br>
<em>Is there a possibility to prevent network attached storages / backup services from beeing affected by things like ransomware / realtime encryption?</em><br>

<p>Those reviews explained that (at least the Crucial SSD's based on Marvel controllers) are essentially a RAID array of memory chips soldered to the board, invisible to the end-user as separate entities. I recall one or more of the reviews explicitly stated that the smaller capacity drive sequential access speeds were lacking because it had only half the number of chips of the larger drive. The slowdown was almost linear according to their testing. Thus, I conclude that when I partition such a drive, only a part of the chips are going to be in the partition, thus I'm going to suffer from the said linear slowdown.</p>

<p>Is the above true for Marvell based Crucials? For other drives such as Samsung-controller based, Sandforce-based, others? I'm particularly interested in the Crucial drives, them being the best bang for the buck right now. I'd be happy to also RAID a couple of those on an X79, but totally unsure about partitioning that either. However, that would be a separate question, and not a part of this one, so I'd like to first firgure out partitioning a single SSD drive.</p>

<p>My mind was wandering around the term ""webmaster"" I read the Wikipedia, I read some stack overflow posts about it. And yet I see it still confuses some people. Some guys proposed that if you developed a web page and configure it's web server, that'd be a webmaster role. And more or less it fits with the Wikipedia description.
Certainly, due to the evolution of the web, these roles have become individual new ones (developers, sysadmins, designers, etc..)</p>

<p>My scenario and question is different. Suppose one owns a server (physical) and installs, configures and administers already existing web apps (WordPress, etc...) </p>

<p>That role, could also be ""webmaster"" or it shifts to something else? I kinda doubt a little, because there is no developing part.</p>

<p>And I don't know the specs for HDMI, but I'm having absolutely no noticable problems with a 10 meter hdmi cable, and judging by what I saw on the market this should go on for quite some distance beyond this (at least 20m).</p>

<p>Meanwhile over in USB land the maximum distance extension cable I've seen was 3 meters, any longer and it's generally deemed unreliable unless you have a repeater on your cable, and I've actually tested this and if I am extending a USB cable beyond the recommended parameters I start seeing problems (even over 5m with a repeater I have problems) hell, I have a 5 meter cable with no repeater, and it worked for a while shortly after I got it, but then when I tried to connect devices to it after only short use it simply stopped working (windows said unknown/unrecognized device or something like that) and this is only for up to a maximum of 5gbit transfer rates, much lower than what you could acheive with ethernet.</p>

<p>And somehow despite all these problems, it seems like it has no issue with USB Hubs for connecting multiple devices to the same port (as long as they all get powered independently...) but admittedly this too starts degrading if you are using extension cables...</p>

<p>Why does USB have these problems with cable lengths; and only these VERY SHORT lengths when everything else seems to be able to extend pretty much across an entire building without any noticable issues?</p>

I restored to an earlier point to where I know they had not updated to 10. Restarted. Told windows not to install until I requested it. Now we get a RED notice Windows 10 upgrade failed. (which is good). Now when the computer is being shut down I think it is trying to upgrade (Message says installing 1 update). No idea what the update is. is there a way we can tell the computer NOT to install the one update? Checking the update list of what is to be updated, nothing is there, so I have NO actual idea of what it is, I am guessing Windows 10 is my best guess. If no solution, I guess I'll have to let windows 10 install and then restore it back to 7. I just don't want to waste the time. Thanks</p>

The AVR has a LCD display showing the current input (mains) is 237 and the output voltage 210-217V. My question is, because i'm not familiar with electricity too much, what is the deal with that, is it something wrong with my AVR or they all work like that.</p>

<p>And while i was searching for an answer for this topic I've found some other information online like: ""...So in general and within reason, higher voltages give you higher efficiencies."" And: ""Here's a quick explanation of why power supplies get less efficient as the supply voltage decreases. All electronic components (transistors, transformers, even the traces on the printed circuit board) have some sort of equivalent resistance...""</p>

<p>Anyway am I putting more stress on the PSU by using AVR or it is normal. Thanks</p>

I read the manual and it seems that the only properties that could help me was positioning the picture when in VGA mode (from the monitor menu). But it seems that this option still gives power to the broken pixels and even more - even if we ignore those pixels (maybe place some tape over them so that they are not visible) - I can't move the picture enough that it's not overlapping with them.</p>

<p>I'm running various OSes but currently I'm messing with linux. I have nvidia dirvers for my GPU but I don't know - is there some way I could move the picture displayed to the monitor so that it doesn't overlap with the broken pixels?</p>

<p>I had been thinking about moving anyway as their service is somewhat lacking, but they have features I like.</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is finding an alternative that does the same.</p>

<p>The biggest feature about Bitcasa, is that it does not have to have a sync folder. It works exactly like plugging a new drive into the computer. This meant, no matter the size of the PC, I could access over 1TB of data. They also had some mirror options, where you could select a folder and mirror it to the drive.</p>

<p>I've looked at a lot of providers and cannot seem to find anything that offer this type of service. 
I have tried Google Drive but the desktop application is terrible. 
You can only install it in the base location, you cannot include other files out of this base location, and it syncs, meaning if I want to access the 1TB of data I have in the cloud, I need 1TB of free space, in the location its installed it.</p>

<p>I have tried mklink's and junctions and symlinks, but the app just doesnt like them and on reboot of the PC, it fails to sync correctly.</p>

<p>I've had a look at Dropbox, ICloud, IDrive, SkyDrive and Box, but if they offer this type of online storage, its not in their features or FAQ's.</p>

<p>I have Windows 7 pro, an NVIDIA GT730 and two monitors(AOC e2752She, BenQ GW2765) attached to the NVidia card using the DVI ports using this cable: (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00NH11X64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-HDMI-DVI-Adapter-Cable/dp/B00NH11X64?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage</a>). I originally only had the AOC with a native resolution of 1920x1080. Then I got the BenQ, but on setting it up Windows would only allow 1920x1080 for it. So I went into the Nvidia control panel and created a custom resolution 2560x1440 and set it to that. Superficially it looks like it did it as the background got small for it and the conrol panel/display/screen resolution setting SAYS 2650x1440, but the image is ""soft"", not crisp and when I look at the information panel on the display itself, the monitor says it is being driven at 1920x1080 and its recommended setting is 2650x1440, so I'm thinking that windows must be doing some emulation of 2560x1440 and not actually pushing it natively at 2560x1440. Even if I set the monitor to 1920x1080 the image is really ""soft"".</p>

<p>I want to use this monitor (gw2765) for graphic design and video editing, so I really need it to show it's true resolution. I have searched for quite a long time and have not found anything that seems to address this issue.</p>

While there, I had discovered and heavily used MobaXterm for ssh (and the occasional X session). The standout feature for me was that when connected to a remote server, it would provide a file browser of the remote server beside the terminal (with full desktop integration). When running multiple ssh sessions as I do, this was an unexpected productivity boost (rather than having to drop out to a local terminal and scp, or open up a separate file browser window). </p>

<p>Is there anything comparable for Linux? I'm well aware that I can use nautilus to mount an ssh server as a 'filesystem', but I'm looking for something that more tightly ties the terminal to the file browser.</p>

I'll then process the video in Maltab.</p>

<p>Now to the networking part (I'm a beginner in this field):</p>

<p>1- Generally speaking, is this type of networking considered peer-to-peer networking? Please note that i want the data to pass through the WiFi routers, not get uploaded and downloaded online (My understanding that this thing is possible and that's how some applications like AirDroid work, not quite sure of that though)</p>

<p>2- If that exists, any hint on how to calculate the possible bandwidth of this type of connections?</p>

<p>3- Any ideas on how to implement that? for example, if i connect the camera to a raspberry pi and install some server software on it and assign it to an IP address. would connecting to that IP address be implicitly done through my router (given i do some certain needed settings)? If not, then how to do this?</p>

"1076588","How can I improve my linux security?","<p>I dabble in Linux from time to time. Oddly enough at one time in the past and just today, I've found my system compromised (that is my perception at least). In my opinion I'm no expert in Linux or even an intermediate user, but I am technically knowledgeable enough to know my way around a computer, especially Windows.</p>

<p>Let me explain whats happened.</p>

<p>Some time ago when I was just getting really serious about learning to use Linux, I was running Fedora from an external drive. I do know that I had never visited any shady websites with that particular installation. What happened next was inexplicable to me as a long-time windows user. I noticed that a file on my desktop moved as if someone had click &amp; dragged it.</p>

<p>I wasn't not paying much attention to it at the time. A day or so later I booted the machine up again and witnessed the same thing happen. To me it was as if someone was ""in"" my machine, dragging and dropping files from or to my machine from some kind of virtual interface invisible to me.</p>

<p>I nuked that installation with a re-format.</p>

<p>I began to get serious about learning to use Linux just this week. I decided to just run Fedora from within Oracle's VirtualBox. I was partitioning a drive with fdisk (using SUDO instead of SU after adding my account to the sudoer's file) when I noticed that when I looked at all of my partitions I could see my hard disk outside of the VM! I entered another command, and recieved a warning about a AVC denial. As soon as I said ""That doesn't look right..."" my Windows 10 OS running the VM signaled that Windows defender and my AV solution had been turned off. A bit alarmed, I proceeded to try to get it running again but Windows wouldn't have it. I spent a few hours fixing everything. It got to a point (after shutting down the VM) where whenever I booted and logged in to Windows 10, a BSOD would occur with a ""watchdog_violation"" of some kind.</p>

<p>This VM needed an update, it had been bothering me for software updates for at least two or three days. As with my Windows experience, getting compromised in a short period of time like that didn't seem likely to me.</p>

<p>I managed to fix it just now and I'm on it running a windows defender scan.</p>

<p>So my question is: how can I prevent someone from compromising my machine in the future? What are some security best practices with Linux and VM's?</p>

<p>I did not use SU, I used SUDO. It was running from within a VM, and I don't know how the connection to the web works in that configuration. I don't know how in the world someone would have managed to get in to my VM and then my outer machine that way.</p>

"1077730","Can I set a minimal time required between clicks for a double-click?","<p>This might be a bit of a weird question and usually easily solvable, but company restrictions prevent me from doing this the easy way, so please bear with me.</p>

<p>In my office work-space I've been assigned a mouse to work with. This mouse unfortunately is slightly defective. Defective enough to be highly annoying but not defective enough to pass for a replacement. The main problem is:</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes when I single-click, the mouse sends 2 clicks in a row, resulting in a double-click</strong></p>

<p>This is highly annoying, for example it has caused me to close 2 windows instead of just the one I want multiple times. And as a programmer, when I want to place the cursor at a specific point in my code I accidentally select the whole line and start overwriting what I made before.</p>

<p>Of course I've consulted <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/266738"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft's Knowledge Base</a> for this. Step 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Verify your clicking method:</strong> Make sure that you are performing a true single physical click. A single-click occurs when you press and release a mouse button one time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well... Microsoft doesn't take my complaint very serious it seems. The article basically ends with me having to turn the mouse off and on again.</p>

<p>So I tried messing with the double-click speed settings in windows. But the only thing it really changes is the maximum delay between clicks for it to register a double-click. This doesn't solve my problem at all because the speed at witch these inputs are send are close to a few millisecond. And I still want to actually double-click when I want to.</p>

<p>I can only see 2 options that would fix my dilemma (and I prefer the latter):</p>

<ol>
<li>Physically break the mouse - If my mouse literally doesn't work anymore, I can get a replacement, hopefully by the end of this day, probably by the end of the week.</li>
<li>Find a way to force a time delay between clicks to register as a double-click - the problem is caused by inputs that are being send a few milliseconds in a row. A human is pretty much physically restricted to having a clicking delay of about 100 milliseconds, if I can somehow filter out these false positives by enforcing a - let's say - 50 millisecond delay required before I can click again for a double click, that would solve my problem. In theory.</li>

<p>Additionally, is it possible to copy the RAM contents for a specific process?</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong></p>

<p>This largely revolves around CryptoLocker (as well as similar malware) and making it possible to recover data quickly without having to pay for the private key that it uses.</p>

<p>While CryptoLocker doesn't store the private key anywhere on the file-system, <strong>it does need to keep it in memory</strong> to continuously encrypt files. So given that you can capture an active CryptoLocker process, know the length of the private key, and you know what encryption was used, you theoretically could loop through each bit attempting to decrypt a specific (small) file.</p>

<li>IIS</li>
<li>Some Webservices</li>

<p><strong>Problem description:</strong></p>

<p>HOST2 was previously a physical server, which crashed and so i converted it to a virtual server. I now run it as HyperV guest on HOST1. From internal LAN, everything works just as it did before. The only problem is, that now neither HOST1 nor HOST2 are accessible from public internet (which worked before). </p>

<p>I configured HOST1 to be an HyperV host and added one virtual (external) switch ""SWITCH1"". HOST2 uses SWITCH1 as ethernet adapter.</p>

<p>Since this action, neither HOST2 nor HOST1 are accessible from public internet, but are accessible from internal lan.</p>

<p>I looked at the properties of NIC1 on HOST1, and it showed that none of the (previously) checked elements (IP4, IP6, Client for Microsoft Networks, etc) are checked, but on SWITCH1 they are. Only checked option in NIC1 is ""HyperV - extendable virtual switch"" (please excuse the translations of the elements - I use german windows and translated them).</p>

<p>If I try to enable these properties on NIC1, neither HOST1 nor HOST2 are accessible, even in private lan.</p>

"1084026","Troubleshoot Windows Update service","<p>On my Windows 7 computer, I had noticed that one of the four CPUs was running around 100%, spending ±25% of my PCs CPU.
As the number was slightly changing, I knew that it was not an infinite loop, so I started investigating.</p>

<p>Using standard Windows task manager, I saw that the process which was doing this, was a ""svchost.exe"" process. Following its process ID (PID) to the ""Services"" tab, I could derive that the ""netsvcs"" Windows service group was responsible. In order to know which of the subscribed services was responsible, I started up ""Process Explorer"" (a third-party extended task manager), which led me to the ""wuauServ"" Windows service. I have stopped it and the CPU dropped immediately, so I've found the service, causing the issue.</p>

<p>Now I would like to go further: the Windows Update service (wuauServ) seems to have problems (hence the high CPU), but nothing seems to be written to the event log (at least not to the ""Windows Logs/Application"" event log).</p>

<p>Does anybody know how I can find out what is causing the high CPU load of the Windows Update Service?</p>

"1093130","When renaming a file in Windows, CTRL + Backspace does not delete whole words","<p>The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> shortcut for deleting whole words is a feature in most text editors and text inputs. Due to their usefulness, they have become a part of my everyday typing habits. However, in Windows Explorer, when renaming files, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> enters a  character instead of deleting the previous word. Oddly enough, it's lesser used sibling for deleting the next word <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> works as intended when renaming files.</p>

<p>This is a problem on my work PC, which uses Windows 7. But I recall this being a problem in my home PC,  which is running Windows 10.</p>

<p>Why does this seemingly universal shortcut not work in this scenario? Are there workarounds (be it first party or third party) to implement this functionality?</p>

Windows Recovery Environment","<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: <em>I failed to enable BitLocker on my tablet's system drive for the first time and now I see an error each time I restart Windows or try to enable BitLocker again. Windows claims that this is due to not configured Windows Recovery Environment and I don't know, what to do next.</em></p>

<p>I have a Windows 10 Pro-based tablet with TPM available and wated to enable BitLocker encryption on drive C: (system drive and the only one in fact, of that matters).</p>

<p>I enabled it for the first time and I went through few steps of its wizard. First, Windows checked, if my hardware allows to use BitLocker. This step passed without problems. Next, I saw a screen in which Windows claimed, that it is moving Windows Recovery Environment to some other (hidden) partition. Reasons for such move remains unknown to me.</p>

<p>In third screen or step I saw I question, where to I want to store encryption key and three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>save it to Microsoft account,</li>
<li>store it on USB,</li>
<li>print it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a tablet with only microUSB port. I didn't have microUSB-based pendrive or microUSB OTG cable when enabling BitLocker for the first time. And I have my Windows 10 with only single local account. Thus, non of above options was available for me and <code>Next</code> button was disabled.</p>

<p>I've clicked <code>X</code>, seen some error message and shut down my tablet.</p>

<p>When I started it again next day I saw following error during Windows start-up:</p>

<p>Now, I can see it with every Windows 10 restart. This is really weird for me, because -- as I wrote above -- BitLocker configuration was not finished and thus neither BitLocker is enabled nor encryption key is put to TPM.</p>

<p>Each time I try to re-enable BitLocker for C: drive I see following error:</p>

<p>I don't understand, how it is possible that Windows managed to move Windows Recovery Environment from <code>C:</code> drive to a hidden partition, but isn't able to move it back?</p>

<p>Anyway, can anyone shed some light and explain me, what should I do now or how to proceed from this point? How to move back Windows Recovery Environment manually? How to get rid of that startup error message? And the most important -- how to enable BitLocker and encrypt my system drive on my tablet?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to Youtube is blocked by policy for bandwidth reasons.  It is
  not physically possible to open up access to specific videos within
  YouTube or enable access for specific individuals.  To enable access
  we would need to open up the whole of YouTube to the whole business.
  The knock on effect would mean that the internet would grind to a halt

I can hook it up to the internet through Wi-Fi, and hit it like a normal webserver with it's IP on the network.</p>

<p>This works great for my home, but at work, my work machine is often on a different network then the devices we bring (we have a bring-your-own-device network for those).</p>

<p>There are <a href=""http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/ap.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">instructions to turn the device into an access point</a>, which doesn't allow it to connect to Wi-Fi, but that's okay since it doesn't really need to hit the internet itself.</p>

<p>I'm wondering then, is there a way for me to interact with the device, like a webserver, without having to switch away from my work network? If I can see the device on my wireless routers list, I figure I can do other things to the device, but I am not wise in the way of networking. </p>

The process took hours, but before completion, explorer crashed (windows 7 at the time), and the progress bar was gone. I would like to know how Windows behave in that case.</p>

<p>Is there a chance of data loss, or is windows 7 smart enough to ""close and cancel"" the current file ? I have doubts.
If data was lost, does the source of the cut and paste matter (from the external hard drive, or from the system hard drive) ?
I'm really interested to know how a potential data loss can translate, assuming it crashed while copying a txt file of a few bytes - missing file ? Corrupted file ?</p>

"1109929","Why do German and US Layout only differ by Y and Z?","<p>The US and German character layouts only differ by the Y and Z characters, those are exchanged. There is the subtlety that the US character layout usually comes with an ANSI button layout (slim enter) whereas the German character layout is usually with the ISO button layout (large enter).</p>

<p>While looking for the history of this, one often finds that the relative frequency of characters is different in German and English. The letters on the typewriter become entangled when used too fast, therefore one needs to space frequently used characters apart. This is okay, I do see this difference in relative frequency of the characters “Y” and “Z”.</p>

<p>However, why did they stop there? Why did they only change two characters and not design a completely different (like DVORAK) layout for German (assuming English was first)? I am often in the situation where the two keyboard layouts are similar enough that my fingers can type really fast but now catch on the Y–Z thing fast enough. If the layout was completely different, I might have an easier time to switch between the layouts if needed.</p>

<p>So why do they only differ by exactly one permutation of the letters and nothing more (neglecting special characters)?</p>

The most expensive part of adding more memory is obviously the memory hardware itself, chips on them, etc. But why do motherboards also always impose the limitation? Is there a downside in supporting all 64 bits to pass the signal between CPU/controller/physical memory?</p>

This had the effect of disabling the sliding panel on the lock screen, so that when my computer booted up or I locked my session, I would be presented with the password entry screen immediately (without having to press a key to slide the panel out of the way).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the recent Anniversary Update seems to have undone this. I've tried deleting the value and re-adding it, but the lock screen is still present.</p>

<p>Is there some other way to remove the sliding-panel over the lock screen in Windows 10 which works for versions after the Anniversary Update?</p>

"1204437","File Open/Save Dialog causing applications to crash","<p>Seemingly ever since the Windows 10 Creators Update installed itself on my computer, I've been having issues when using the File Open/Save dialog. If I try and open a file, save a file, or upload a file to attach to an email, the application that I'm using will crash (whether it's Chrome, Word, Paint etc). Edge, however, works fine and weirdly, Firefox also works fine.</p>

<p>I have been doing some debugging, trying to figure out what it could be, but I'm running out of things to try.</p>

<p>I've tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resetting folder views to default</li>
<li>Enabling ""Show all Folders"" in Folder View Settings</li>
<li>Starting computer in safe mode (where the dialog would work just fine)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also run some tests using MS Paint. I downloaded an application called DebugDiag 2, and had that watch the mspaint process to capture the exceptions thrown when the application would crash. These are the ID's of those exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>0XC000001D</li>
<li>0XC000041D</li>
</ul>

<p>Still using MS Paint as my test application, if I ran it as an adminstrator, I was able to use the File Open/Save dialog perfectly fine, but closing the application then reopening as a normal user would then end with the application crashing upon trying to open a file.</p>

<p>Another thing I've noticed is that when I first sign into Windows, I have about 30 seconds where I can open MS Paint, and be able to use the File Open/Save dialog just fine. After that time, if I close the dialog and then try to use it again, the application will crash.</p>

<p>I've read online that this issue is sometimes caused by the File Open/Save dialog trying to show a folder that no longer exists, or is on an unreachable network drive. So with that in mind, I have restarted my computer (getting that 30 seconds of grace when I first sign in) to be able to open MS Paint, and save a new file to my downloads folder, in the hopes that it would update the ""last used folder"". Unfortunately, this didn't solve the issue.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I can try?</p>

<p>I acquired a <em>Dell M6800</em> laptop that was considered bad or dead. Little troubleshooting was done at the time it was sent to the waste pile. I understood it to be a bad motherboard. I brought it home and put some RAM, disk drive in and attempted to turn it on. One of the diagnostic lights would flash on for a split second and then the machine would just remain off. I replaced the motherboard with an eBay replacement. The result was the same. I replaced the DC jack cable since it would seem the machine wasn't getting power. </p>

<p>The result: More diagnostic lights, remaining on, and the CPU and GPU heatsinks warming up. No fans, no other power. I double checked RAM spec as it seems this model will only work properly with DDR3L. Making sure that was correct caused a couple lights to go off. Even on just the battery, the result is the same.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>The only diagnostic light that is on is the power indicator light. It comes on and remains on as long as the battery is connected or plugged in with the PS. The heatsinks for both the CPU and GPU warm up, as if they are running.

<p>To open extensionless files, I have to double click/right click -> Open With on the file, then scroll down until I find whatever it is I think I need, usually notepad/notepad++, a hex editor, or an image editor/viewer. I tried to set a hex editor as the default program for extensionless programs, but I can't. I found an article from 1999 recommending the registry editor, and that <em>would</em> work, but this hex editor wasn't actually installed (it's just an .exe) and doesn't have anything in the registry. I don't have any reference for how to set it as a default program for the . extension in the registry.</p>

<p>After searching around a bit more, I found that, on win8, you can change file associations in Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Associations. And while I did see the . extension there, I can't seem to set a default program for it. The . extension is only there because I added in the registry, as ""."".</p>

<p>Another method I tried is making an extensionless file, then going to its properties and setting the default program there. Unfortunately, the button to set the default program just isn't there.</p>

<p>Is there any way to accomplish this? And, for that matter, is there a reason I <em>shouldn't</em> be doing this? It seems awfully complicated, and I'm afraid it's for a good reason. The only article I can find that explains how to do this is from before Windows 2000 came out, which isn't a good sign.</p>

<p>You can have a local IM server, but messaging is not much use unless receipients are notified that they have a message - and this seems always to involve GCM, which you need to be online for. It seems the only type of real-time communication you can have on Android that is truly local is SIP, which is only for voice.</p>

<p>It seems there are ways of implementing a local push server but I cannot seem to find any available open-source IM software that actually does or supports this. I am not in a position to spend months developing my own software for this (hence the term ""feasible"", not just ""possible""!), nor do I want to use anything proprietary, even if such a thing does exist.</p>

<p>It looks like TextSecure used to provide this but the the Android version was discontinued.</p>

<p>I'm quite surprised by this dependency, so my question is more of a ""really???"" than a ""how?"" - but if there is a how, I would love to hear it!</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> </p>

<p>I was employed to manage the online content for a small, seasonal rental company, (the kind where they work the summer to survive the winter) and that quickly turned into also managing their IT when they discovered I was ""good with computers"".  We had a major issue with emails yesterday where 2 days worth of emails just disappeared from the outlook .pst file never to return (I had local backups so actual damage was minimal).  So, my boss asked me to see what I could do to improve the current setup for as little cost as possible (he's not trying to get something for nothing, just has minimal budget because of the business type)</p>

<p>Please keep in mind through all of this that e-mail is not my strong point.</p>

<p><strong>The current setup</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>We have 3 mail accounts info@, bookings@, admin@</p></li>
<li><p>We have 3 computers, all which need access to the 3 mailboxes at the same time</p></li>
<li><p>Currently all accounts come via POP into a single pst file on one computer, which then uses simpleSYN to replicate the file for each of the other computers.  They can then manage emails and replicate back and forth so that all 3 systems see the same email view.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The current setup is cumbersome, and seems fraught with danger by live replicating pst files.  Corruptions reportedly happen every so often, and days of emails disappearing has apparently happened before.  The other issue is that PC A also has to be on all the time otherwise pc B and C don't get emails.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>

<p>It seems to me that some kind of shared mailbox would the best option, having used them in the past for other jobs, but I have no idea how they work or how to set one up.  All google is telling me is that it can be done via Microsoft Exchange, but I can't seem to find any other option to compare it to, and I genuinely cannot access the admin panel on our 365 account to see if we have that option on our subscription.</p>

<p>IMAP isn't really an option as a) our hosting plan comes with 500mb email per account, and b) the boss is super paranoid about emails so wants them kept locally.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, what are my options?  </p>

<p>I am looking for some kind of shared mailbox that is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Economical</li>
<li>Does not require any kind of networking qualification to set up</li>
<li>Low risk of losing emails (I currently keep daily local backups of the pst files)</li>
<li>Can keep our current email addresses</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>note:</strong> I am also going to be setting up a server to host the booking system (the bosses PC also has to be on all the time for that to work) and for all documents (currently in dropbox and running out of space). I'm not sure if that could be part of the solution or not.</p>

<p>Apologies for the long post, but wanted to give as much info as possible.</p>

<p>Cheers in advance...</p>

The end result is that what I often end up doing is spamming spacebar a bit to get to where this prompt should be, then spam backspace in case I ended up typing into the password prompt, then enter my password.

<li>Google server is also connected to Internet exchange.If yes not sure how ? Similarly if i host my new website through any web hosting service provider(WHSP), then that WHSP must be connected to internet exchange</li>
<li>Then router at internet exchange will route the data to google server connected to Internet exchange</li>

"1343248","How is the Metric value decided in WIndows","<p>After reading <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/198544/how-does-windows-7-decide-which-route-to-take-if-2-connections-to-an-internet-so"">this question</a>, I was wondering how the operating system 'chooses' the Metric value for a route.</p>

<p>I have 2 dynamically added routes for internet:</p>

<pre><code>      0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0      192.168.0.1    192.168.0.239     45
      0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0         10.0.0.1       10.0.0.254     15
</code></pre>

<p>So naturally, my traffic is being routed to the gateway at <code>10.0.0.1</code> first because 15 &lt; 45, if there are no routes on <code>10.0.0.1</code>, it will be routed to <code>192.168.0.1</code> for delivery.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is:</p>

<p><strong>How does Windows (or any OS with a routing implementation) decide the metric value for these 2 interfaces?</strong></p>

<p>I notice some people contradicting each other in the comments of the linked question when it comes to priority based on Ethernet/Wireless and the like.
For this reason I want to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>The interface with Metric 45 is a Wireless adapter</li>
<li>The interface with Metric 15 is connected to a Hyper-V Virtual Switch hosted on the same machine.</li>
</ol>

"1122410","How does my computer determine which DNS server to use?","<p>I'm giving a presentation to explain how a hostname is resolved into an IP address and all of the complexities involved. I also would like to talk about all of the problems that can happen that could affect the integrity of the resolution.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get some feedback to say what I have right and wrong. I'm not looking for solutions or discussions on DNSSEC, I just want to characterize the normal ""vanilla"" case that a home user would experience.</p>

<p>When a computer wishes to resolve a hostname it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Looks in the hosts file, which is a file whose location is OS specific.</li>
<li>If the hosts file does not contain an entry, then a DNS server needs to be queried. The OS allows you to configure which DNS Server to use and if one has been configured, that's what will be used.</li>
<li>If no DNS server is configured at the OS level, then the DNS server configured at the router will be used.</li>
<li>If the router has no configured DNS server, then the DNS server configured by the ISP will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>And yes, there will be caching happening at each level. Let's just ignore this.</p>

<p>So what can go wrong? The choice of DNS server used can be hijacked anywhere along the route. It can be hijacked by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Malware in the computer</li>
<li>Malware in the router</li>
<li>Another entity running a computer somewhere along the route such as a hacker, ISP or government body.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how well have I characterized the process and the threats? What have I missed?</p>

Over the years, I've had several hardware failures and the resulting downtime to migrate from one laptop to another is painful, and costly in lost work hours.</p>

<p>I have data backup covered, which makes sure I don't lose my code, etc. But backing up and recovering the entire environment (installed software, configuration, etc) has eluded me, and takes a long time to setup on a new machine.</p>

<p>I understand doing a mirror image backup of a drive could be a possible solution, but if you have a mirror backup from one laptop, I'm guessing that, if that laptop is dead (motherboard shot), you can't just restore it on another machine as some drivers, etc may be different due to different hardware.</p>

<p>I've had some exposure to virtual machines on Azure, which I like the concept of having your fully configured environment containerized, which can be saved and moved to any machine with fairly little fuss and time.</p>

<p>Is this a viable solution for a Windows 10 Home laptop? To make it a virtual machine, create a fully configured environment within it that is backed up nightly, and can then be restored on any hardware in the event of a failure?</p>

<p>If so, can the process start by taking my current Windows 10 installation and ""containerizing"" it so I don't have to start from scratch again?</p>

"1210360","Server CAL Licensing","<p>Almost need a lawyer just to figure this stuff out. Tried asking on Microsoft's support site through chat, but got thrown the typical ""Please check this KB"" bs.</p>

<p>I'm currently planning out an infrastructure. As it is right now, 90% of the servers will be Linux based, and user authentication will be handled within ApacheDS on a CentOS 7 virtual server. Part of the plan is going to require three Windows servers - one for hosting an IIS based website, and then two for hosting daeemons that external users (non-authenticated) can connect to and use. The IIS website will be authenticated, but through the LDAP server.</p>

<p>I will probably be able to support this across two rack units - two virtual server installs on one rack, and the other virtual server sitting alongside another Linux one on the other rack.</p>

<p>What, specifically, do I need in terms of licensing this? Do I need one Server 2016 license or two?</p>

<p>Also, in termsof CALs - in total, the size of the administration/IT team is projected to be 25 people within the next year or so. However, the maximum number of people that should have to concurrently be connected via either RDP or the IIS Manager to perform administration on any of the servers at one time is 5. It could be 5 on one server, or 3 on one 2 on another, etc.</p>

<p>Since my authentication is handled through ApacheDS and not through AD - how many CALs do I have to purchase, assuming I'm using User CALs (all connect at home, and I don't intend on limiting them to one device)? Just 5 for the maximum number of concurrent connections? Also, do I need some kind of a CAL or similar for the non-authenticated users that will be interacting with the daemon through a seperate program?</p>

<p>And are IIS Manager connections something that has to be included when purchasing CAL licensing?</p>

<p>I'm looking at Server 2016 Standard, by the way.</p>

To get acquainted, I am making a database to log catches on my fishing trips.  There are several ""categories"" of information, such as ""fish info"" (which would include species, weight, and length) and ""location info"" (includes name of the lake and GPS coordinates).  Other conditions such as the date/time and various weather conditions would also be in there.</p>

<p>I understand that databases are especially good for situations where an entry in one table could relate to multiple entries in a second table.  However, in my use case, a single fish will not have multiple locations, or multiple datetimes/weather conditions.</p>

<p>So my question is, should I be using multiple tables, and break them up according to ""category""?  Or is it best practice to use one table, since no entry in any table will ever correspond to multiple entries in another table?</p>

"1212206","How to get rid of ""Rockettab powered by addonjet""?","<p>I've been trying to get rid of this adware for the past week or so with no results. </p>

<p>Here is what it looks like on my browser (chrome):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/E53oU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/E53oU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Basically it just adds a bunch of ads above my search results--a minor annoyance, but I suspect that the adware is only a gateway for more malicious programs (and some research on Rockettab does seem to corroborate this).</p>

<p>Some more details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The appearance of the ads are very sporadic, if I close them by
clicking on the little ""x"" on the bottom right, they will sometimes
go away for a time but always return later.</p></li>
<li><p>The ads appear in both incognito and normal browser modes</p></li>
<li><p>The ads <strong>do not</strong> appear in the IE or MS Edge browsers</p></li>
<li><p>The ads <strong>do not</strong> appear in other search engines (e.g Bing)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've checked out several guides for removing this thing, but none of them seem to apply to my case. Here's what I've tried so far (none of which has worked):</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempted to uninstall through the Control Panel (there isn't any
program by that name or any program that even seems suspicious to
uninstall)</li>
<li>Cleaned cache, history, cookies, even uninstalled Chrome and reinstalled</li>
<li>Ran Malwarebytes, MSE, MalwarebyesAdaware, HitmanPro</li>
<li>Searched through all folders using ""Everything"" for files with ""Rocket"", ""addonjet"" etc. </li>
<li>Checked the registry for entries with ""Rocket"", ""addonjet"" in their name</li>
</ul>

<p>I really don't know what else to try at this point, any help would be much appreciated.</p>

I had created a local Windows user on my laptop, lets say <code>dummyuser</code>. Later on I connected that local user with the Microsoft account <code>dummyuser@outlook.com</code>.</p>

<p>I want to login to Windows directly without specifying any password. But because it is a microsoft account, I need to have the password set. I overcame this issue by removing ""users must enter password to use this computer"".</p>

"1125013","Why does my computer refuse to boot with a Radeon graphics card?","<p>This is a really strange question, I know, but I have a computer here that refuses to boot with any ATi/AMD Radeon card installed.</p>

<p>When any Radeon card is installed in the machine, all fans will spin without issue (and do not stop, even after a period of five minutes), but the board never gives the initial chirp that it is powered up and nothing is ever output to the display.  The machine does not respond to any keyboard input (including toggling num lock) over USB or PS/2, though the desired build uses USB.  Probing the motherboard's power pins show 12V around 12.131V median, 5V around 5.013V median, and 3.3V at exactly 3.30V.  PWR_OK is solid and the total power output hovers around 92W.  When connecting a GeForce, however, the computer immediately boots up, chirps, and displays the Intel logo.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm going mad.  Certainly Intel didn't create a firmware that refuses to work with an AMD graphics card... did they?  Why would this machine refuse to boot with a Radeon card?</p>

<p><strong>Cards that work</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>EVGA GeForce 9800GTX+ OC edition (x16)</li>
<li>XFX GeForce GTS 250 (x16)</li>
<li>PNY GeForce GT 730 (x8)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cards that don't work</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>XFX Radeon HD 5770 (x16)</li>
<li>MSI Radeon HD 6450M (x8)</li>
<li>XFX Radeon R5 220 Low Power (x16)</li>
<li>Gigabyte Radeon R7 240 (x16)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Computer specifications</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel DP43TF motherboard running firmware version NBG4310H.86A</li>
<li>EVGA 550W power supply (additionally tested all cards on a 600W PSU)</li>
<li>Seagate Barracuda 7200.9 LP 1TB disk on SATA port 0</li>
<li>Sony DRU-810A DVD+RW drive on IDE channel 1</li>
<li>6 GB DDR2-667MHz memory in two pairs - 2x1GB, 2x2GB</li>
<li>No other PCI or PCI Express cards installed</li>
<li>USB keyboard, mouse, and printer</li>
<li>If it matters, Dell S2415H 24"" monitor over HDMI</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering the fact that my trusty old overclocked 9800GTX+ works, yet a very low power R5 does not work, it really does not feel power related.  However, I am open to any suggestion, and I may be able to pull a 730W PSU out of a friend's workstation for testing if it would be worth the test.</p>

"1346457","Battery issues: Should I wait or get my laptop replaced?","<p>I bought a new laptop which has a 10 day replacement policy on it. The laptop has battery issues -- for example, Windows always says that the laptop has 0% battery and that it's not charging (and Endless OS is unable to read the battery percentage) and the laptop seems to switching off randomly (it's a Acer Swift 3).  When I saw that, I ordered a replacement. A technician will visit in a week to authorize the replacement. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I saw today morning that the laptop's battery indicators (Windows) are now working (although I'm yet to see if they're good enough). I'm now draining the battery and charging it back up to see if it's alright. </p>

<p>Should I wait to see if the battery works? And if it works properly in the time the technician comes to visit, should I cancel the replacement? Is it a temporary battery calibration issue or do you think it's a more permanent battery (hardware) issue that might crop up again sometime later (even if it seems alright now)?</p>

"1346678","Drag Down Formula whilst retaining some values but change another","<p>I'm looking for assistance with a problem i'm having when using Excel. The best way to explain the problem i'm encountering is that i'm using the auto-fill drag down to copy and paste essentially a formula.. I'm currently using this function on sheet 1: </p>

<pre><code> =sum('Sheet2'!E2*Sheet3!B3+Sheet3!B2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when dragging down the formula it changes which is expected, but not my intended results. The formula changes to the following: </p>

<pre><code>=sum('Sheet2'!E3*Sheet3!B4+Sheet3!B3)
=sum('Sheet2'!E4*Sheet3!B5+Sheet3!B4)
</code></pre>

<p>My intended result is to have one reference cell change, but keep the last two in the formula the same reference as such: </p>

<pre><code> =sum('Sheet2'!E2*Sheet3!B3+Sheet3!B2)
 =sum('Sheet2'!E3*Sheet3!B3+Sheet3!B2)
 =sum('Sheet2'!E4*Sheet3!B3+Sheet3!B2)
 =sum('Sheet2'!E5*Sheet3!B3+Sheet3!B2)
</code></pre>

<p>With the intended first row populated with the formulas: </p>

<pre><code>=sum('Sheet2'!E2*Sheet3!B3+Sheet3!B2)
=sum('Sheet2'!F2*Sheet3!C3+Sheet3!C2)   
=sum('Sheet2'!G2*Sheet3!D3+Sheet3!D2)   
=sum('Sheet2'!H2*Sheet3!E3+Sheet3!E2)   
=sum('Sheet2'!I2*Sheet3!F3+Sheet3!F2)   
=sum('Sheet2'!J2*Sheet3!G3+Sheet3!G2)   
=sum('Sheet2'!K2*Sheet3!H3+Sheet3!H2)   
=sum('Sheet2'!L2*Sheet3!I3+Sheet3!I2)
</code></pre>

<p>as the drag down formula changes from row to row, the last two references need to remain the same on sheet 3, but sheet 2 change as the row increases, so </p>

<pre><code>'Sheet2'!E3
'Sheet2'!E4
'Sheet2'!E5
'Sheet2'!E6

In situations of high system load (high CPU/memory usage), the <code>System</code> process starts using high CPU in <em>addition</em> to the CPU already used by other processes. This has been happening for at least a year.</p>

<p>Examples of the situations when this happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many Google Chrome tabs open with the Developer Tools open for some of them</li>
<li>A Virtualbox virtual machine with 2-3GB RAM doing some heavy lifting on top of the usual browsers, background apps</li>
<li>A Java application using 1GB of RAM, 3GB of virtual memory using 100% of one CPU core on top of the usual browsers, background apps</li>
</ul>

<p>The irony of the situation is that when the system is already under heavy load, the <code>System</code> using more CPUs causes even more of a slowdown.</p>

<p>Using Process Explorer I've been able to pinpoint the thread within <code>System</code> that uses high CPU to be <code>ntoskrnl.exe!KeRegisterBugCheckReasonCallback</code>. This is a function that should be called by drivers when a BSOD is happening (<a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1107389/what-happens-when-the-windows-kernel-encounters-an-error-it-cannot-resolve"" title=""see this question"">see this question</a>). However in my case no BSOD happens.</p>

<p>The issue occurs even with no USB devices attached, so none of those can be the cause.</p>

<p>I've done a WPA trace when the issue occurred as explained in <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/527401/troubleshoot-high-cpu-usage-by-the-system-process"" title=""this question"">this question</a>, screenshot below. This doesn't tell me much more than resources are used within <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> with the nearest driver in the trail being <code>fltmgr.sys</code>. That doesn't help me a lot because it's not a specific driver that I can uninstall or upgrade.</p>

<p>Any pointers to further debug this are welcome!</p>

<p>Also I created a thread on <a href=""https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/100-disk-utilization-on-windows-10-home-64-bit/fa3dc4d0-92ac-4fcb-a3af-dc4bda067442"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">answers.microsoft.com</a>
 to ask where to find the registry key to tweak HDD driver as recommended by microsoft's site. But of no use.</p>

<p>I tried, stopping many services, clean boot, running process explorer to checks whats using disk the most, as suggested by many online threads. In fact, I formatted by C: drive and installed clean Windows 10. But issue came back!!!</p>

<p>Let me tell me something about my machine: its Dell XPS 15 L502X. Its 2011 edition. It has 16 GB RAM, quad core i7 2630QM. This machine worked perfect with Windows 7,8 and 10 for so many years but now its failing. As I told above I tried everything thats noted in various sites, but nothing helped. </p>

<p>Now I recalled that few months back I was trying to copy paste some big video file to pendrive and I was getting another famous error ""Cannot read from source file issue"". I didnt paid much attention to it. Left those video files as is. I remember I tried running <code>chkdsk</code> with no success. Now I started feeling that the issue was aggravated. I felt this must be due to  bad sectors. So I cut pasted all files in the drives to external hard disk using TeraCopy software. It gives list of files that failed to copy. So I deleted those files when TeraCopy was not able to move them and then recovered those files using EASEUS recovery tool. Then I hard formatted (not quick format) thinking that it will fix bad sectors. This worked for <code>E:</code> drive.</p>

<p>But while doing same for <code>F:</code> drive, it got all screwed. First while recovering files, I was getting <a href=""https://www.google.co.in/search?q=blue+screen+of+death"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blue screen of death</a>. So I left those files unrecovered and went on to hard format the drive. But now after almost 5 hours its barely 30% done. </p>

<p>One more observation, many times after random killing of processes (mostly onedrive which had folder in F: drive), my disk utility used to come to normal after few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Q1.</strong> So should I conclude its hard disk which is culprit here?  </p>

<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Will this formatting of <code>F:</code> drive ever complete?</p>

<p><strong>Q3.</strong> If completed will my machine be fixed, that is will my machine be free from 100% disk utilization? </p>

<p><strong>Q4.</strong> Will my hard disk be safe to use in future for no data loss...</p>

<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Should I buy new hard disk?</p>

<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Does hard formatting fix bad sectors at all?</p>

<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Should I do the same for <code>C:</code> drive too? While installing Windows I did quick format, not hard format.</p>

<p>Sorry for so many questions...but I have wasted many weeks on this. And no thread online is of help to me.</p>

After doing research for the last 3h hours stuck im stuck on how a few of the steps work in the process. From my understanding you get a IP Phone, have it connected to your router, router connects to the internet and then from there you are connected to your PSTN provider, the PSTN then sends the digital signals to the receiver(at least from what i understood). What i dont get is a PBX and if it is needed, also how exactly does the Digital signal get from the PSTN all the way to another persons house phone or whatever.</p>

"1127334","Why did Windows Update 'forget' about the updates I did?","<p>Until now I've kept my Windows installation offline as I've just used it for gaming offline (I have Ubuntu on a separate disk as my main OS). I recently (last week) decided to download Unreal Engine as I'm beginning to learn C++. </p>

<p>To install Unreal I needed to download SP1, so for the first time, I connected my PC to the internet and began updating; this is where the problem begins.</p>

<p>First, SP1 didn't appear in the list of updates, so I installed all of the other updates hoping it would appear, and after many failures in the optional updates, they eventually finished and SP1 appeared.</p>

<p>Again, many failures in trying to install SP1, approximately 6 days later (around 2-3 hours ago), Windows came out of the blue boot-up screen after finalizing updates. I thought I was finally ready to install Unreal. Open it (Unreal) up and begin installing, it throws out an error that it needs SP1, even though I just finished installing it. I opened Windows Update to make sure I hadn't missed anything, and I hadn't. I figured one more reboot and it should have applied itself.</p>

<p>Following the reboot, I open Unreal to see the same error (No SP1). I open Windows update, and sure enough: all the updates I'd been working at the past 6 days where in a list in front of me, ""ready to install"". </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> wanted to use Unreal Engine, needed Windows SP1, spent 6 days installing Windows Updates and pulling out my hair at all the errors. Finally ""finish"" the updates. They've reverted. The past 6 days and dozens of restarts, failures and error codes; wasted.</p>

<p>Why won't Windows take the damn updates? I would have posted this on the Microsoft forums but looking at other people's posts, Microsoft aren't massively helpful.</p>

<p>So, my questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Would the PCI 2.3 RAID controller be compatible with my motherboard?</li>
<li>Similarly, would the PCI 2.2 one be fine with a PCI 2.3/3.0 motherboard?</li>
<li>Is there anything else (other than the PCI version) to be considered (in terms of compatibility)?</li>
</ol>

<li>2 x SATA 600 7-pin</li>
<li>1 x PCIe</li>
<li>1 x gigabit-ethernet Realtek RTL8111H</li>

<ul>
<li>2 x 4 GB DDR3RAM 1600 MHz 240-pin DIMM</li>

<ul>
<li>1 x 240 GB connected via SATA 600 7-pin</li>

<p>2nd Ethernet adapter: edimax, EN-9260TX-E, Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express Adapter</p>

<ul>
<li>1 x gigabit-ethernet PCIe</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to know:</p>

<p>1.) how is the SSD drive powered? Over the SATA 600 7-pin connection or by a separate cable?</p>

<p>2.) By using Toms-Hardware guide and energy calculator, the estimated power need for the set-up is about 78W (MainBoard, 15W, CPU 55W, RAM 6W, SSD 1W, Ethernet 1W). Is that number realistic? Would it be possible to take a high-end note-book power-supply unit and to use the ATX 12 V 4 pol connector on the asus board to power the set-up 24/7? Would you have any recommendation of such a PSU?</p>

<p>3.) I thought to build the case out of wood and plexi glass. What would be an argument against a self made, electrical non conducting case? Evt. to not shield electromagnetic fields, from both sides?</p>

It is a personal hub that I use for multiple computer/android-based (chromium/androids) devices that is used to serve as a hub for several devices like mic headsets, usb mouse, usb keyboard, and the occassional flashdrive. My problem is that I constantly have to unplug it and replug it back into the device I want to use it with.</p>

<p>Like for example, I have a PC in which I write all of my programs, and play video games, and I have an Android Tablet, where I keep all of my personal stuff. I have an adapter that allows me to plug regular USB 2.0 stuff into the android's microusb port including a usb hub. Now, I don't want to use a separate keyboard, mouse, and headset for each device, if both devices are in the same workstation area. So, my question is there some sort of ""USB switch"" I could use? A switch that connects both of my ""workstation"" devices to a single USB hub, and has some sort of button that all I have to do is press it to change what device the hub ""belongs"" to instead of unplugging and replugging in the hub?</p>

<p>The sdcard just stopped working one day (the file browser doesn't show it and it's not visible in Android settings), I tried re-inserting it. When that didn't work I used my sdcard reader on my Linux machine.
There I was able to mount and browse the filesystem, but after inserting it into Android it still didn't show up. I inserted it back to my Linux machine and the filesystem was gone (the device was recognized though). So I gave up and used cfdisk to create a new (ext4) partition.
After doing that and quitting cfdisk, the previous filesystem (vfat) was recovered and the files could be browsed and viewed. I have no idea what's going on.</p>

"1216549","Is my design secure?","<p>I've experience of system design and programming but not of internet security. Can someone help to determine if the following design is reasonably secure?</p>

<p>The system consists of two parts: </p>

<p>Firstly a website / server (secured with SSL) which displays a map and plots a breadcrumb trail of a user's location. Friends &amp; relatives, given a password by the user, can log in and see where users are located and where they've been (e.g. for the last 24 hours). </p>

<p>Secondly, a phone app which sends GPS data up to the server. The main design consideration of the latter is to keep location messages as short as possible, to minimise both battery life and the user's data allowance. So I don't really want to use SSL for sending messages from the phone (it will add a large overhead to an otherwise small message - probably sent every minute). It also adds to the app's complexity and size.</p>

<p>My proposed solution is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When registering (via the website) the system creates a hash for the user, based on username and password, which is stored in the database as a 'user ID' (this would be a different hash from one used to just store the password). Possibly SHA512 although that might be unneccesarily long.</p></li>
<li><p>When installing the app on their phone, users would enter username &amp; password. The app then uses the same hash algorithm, and sends the hash value to the server via  a non-SSL endpoint. If recognised, the server responds OK and the app stores the hash as a user ID.</p></li>
<li><p>While the app is running, every time a new location is noted it is sent, along with a timestamp and the user ID, to the server (again non-SSL). The server stores the data accordingly against the correct user ID.</p></li>
<li><p>The server would be running two separate web services, one SLL and one not, both talking to the same database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There's probably a flaw here somewhere, please let me know if so! The security consideration is, of course, that someone who hasn't been given a password should not be able to see a user's whereabouts. Thanks in advance.</p>

"1350465","How to get a BareMetal x86-64 machine","<p>I know there is RaspberryPI for bare-metal ARM, but wondering if there is an x86-64 machine in which either (a) it has no operating system preinstalled installed, or (b) you can uninstall the operating system and start from scratch with assembly / boot loaders and such to install your own custom operating system (non-linux, from scratch, bare-metal, etc.). I have seen <a href=""https://minnowboard.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">minnowboard</a>, but it seems out of stock and with a lack of support unlike the RaspberryPI, so doesn't seem like a great option atm.</p>

<p>If there is a way to get an x86-64 bare-metal device, wondering where to look to get started. I have seen a few posts saying <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/662927/is-there-a-way-to-completely-delete-chrome-os-on-a-chromebook-and-install-linu"">warning</a> and whatnot, using ChromeBook to delete the operating system. But I don't know enough to determine if that is the correct way you are supposed to get to a bare-metal x86-64 machine. Am interested to know if that is the correct approach, and the warnings are basically just that you won't be able to get your Chrome OS back (which makes sense). The warning makes it seem like you won't at all be able to use the hardware anymore. I wouldn't want to uninstall the OS and then try one time to install a custom OS only to make a mistake and now the hardware is ruined. Please let me know if that is the situation, or if it is more relaxed, and after you uninstall an OS you can try over and over again to debug/install a custom OS without ruining the hardware.</p>

In order to reduce the heat, I made the laptop sit over a laptop stand with fan. That did not help much in reducing the heat.<br>
As a next step, I'm using a table fan (for myself and) for the laptop for better cooling. It does the job, but, I'm unsure it this is a right way of doing things to cool down.  </p>

<p>For example, fans that fit in the vent of the laptop employ suction to pull air out of the system (induced cooling) to enable cooling. However, in my case, I'm forcing air against the vent of the laptop. This (forced cooling) is against the direction of the air coming out of the laptop.  </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Can this cause heat to spread within the laptop and cause harm?</li>
<li>Would it be a better idea if I kept the table fan on the other side of the laptop and let air swipe in the direction as the vent air from the laptop?</li>

Occasionally, these runs will take upwards of 500GB of allocated memory. Since this machine only currently has 132GB of RAM, this additional memory allocation comes through the paging file.</p>

<p>The paging file is current on a spinning HDD array and is causing a huge bottleneck. I have investigated maxing out the memory (288GB) and adding a 400GB Intel 750 NVMe SSD as a dedicated pagefile disk.

<p>Short of getting the 800GB Intel 750 for the understood max page file size of 864GB (3x 288GB), can I tell Windows to use the HDD array as a failover for extra pagedisk space? Is there any way to prioritize the SSD as primary for the pagefile? Thanks.</p>

We've set up automatic handling of the booking requests so the requests are accepted/rejected when the room is available or not. Default users can only see when a room is available or busy, no further details. </p>

<p>However, the people who work at the reception desk should be able to also see the organiser and subject of the meeting, but not the details of the meeting itself. On top of that, they also need the permission to copy the meeting to their personal calendar so that the meetings show up in the calendar pane at the mail view.</p>

<p>I've already granted the reception full access rights to the mailbox of the meeting rooms, but that way they can see the details as well. I've tried removing all permissions and then sharing the calendar with them, with the permission to see the organiser and subject, but then they cannot copy the meetings to their personal calendar.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can set the permissions so that the requested setup is achieved?</p>

<p>Of course until the full specs of these CPUs become public the exact answer to that specific question can only be speculative.</p>

<p>I'm both interested in the type of problems as well as their severity.</p>

<p>I see two approaches for answers: the theoretical approach and past experience. What does an OS need to support on a CPU and what would happen if it doesn't? Would this lead to disabled features or to crashes? And what happens if you install an old OS on a modern CPU it does not support?</p>

<p>Could you please help me with the computer hardware question?</p>

<p>I work on Excel spreadsheets. Data sets in the spreadsheets are big. When formulas are applied to the spreadsheets, it takes long to complete the computation (depends on the complexity of the formulas, sometimes a set of formula takes more than 1.5 hour to complete). </p>

<p>I am working on the laptop (2.5 GHz, 8G RAM). So I’m thinking if change to a desktop computer would help.</p>

<p>Thinking a desktop computer is the solution, when the budget is tight, which area shall I invest more? Do I need a faster processor/CPU, or a bigger RAM is better for Excel spreadsheets running?</p>

When the SQL text is embedded/constructed as a string in PHP or other web page, the text has to be sent to the DB and compiled before execution.  This is not only less efficient in the database, it makes the PHP (or whatever) interpreter do more work before sending, and the web server more work to fetch the larger page.  So I am wondering why I have never seen stored procedures used in any of the several large open source web apps I've looked at, not even some that ONLY support mySQL or MS SQL Server (both of which have stored procedures).</p>

<p>As well as numerous variations of that phrase.</p>

<p>Surely that is a reasonable search query?</p>

But still when Im replacing files in windows folder and restart process or reboot the system it give blank screen. Arghh.</p>

<p>As I read <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1297387/how-to-modify-a-resource-in-exporer-exe"">on this topic </a> you cant run edited explorer.exe, but on other forums I also have read kind of tutorials where local ts modify their explorer with restorator or something and teaching it. 
I dont want to use malware cracked soft so I didnt try restorator. Also I coulndt find and orb changer without being heavly infected (I check here <a href=""https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/</a>).</p>

<p><strong>1) Does anybody know how to edit explorer resources and then  successfully run it on Win 7 x64?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2) Any free orb changer without viruses?</strong></p>

The OS of the Windows Computer often gets reinstalled or the whole HD is beeing changed, so the goal is not having to reinstall the software everytime manually. The Raspberry always stays connected to the Computer over USB.

I'm using 2-factor authentication to log in to my account with them, HTTPS for my site, and SSH to move files to and from the server. However, the account also has what appears to be unencrypted FTP access which can't be disabled. I assume they know what they're doing but it seems like this leaves an unnecessary security risk:</p>

<li>If I log in via FTP, my password could be compromised since someone could see it in plain text. I can just not use FTP, but it seems like it would be safer to just not allow the connection at all.</li>
<li>Someone could brute-force their way into my account my guessing password, and the 2FA or SSH keys used for other access to the account would be moot.</li>

"1519944","UPS on DC lines","<p>How could a UPS switch between battery and AC wall socket fast from around 4 ms to 12 ms. What make it especial to switch in that very low time. As far as I know it has relays inside it to perform the switching action, but the relay itself can't switch as fast. I am asking this because I need something to switch between 2 DC lines and I tried multiple 12 V DC relays to 30 amps ones and my devices still has to switch off or to reboot once the main DC power source cutt so the backup can't keep up.</p>

<p>I have a DC power system and AC one. The DC works as the backup batteries and the AC is the city power which I don't care about consumed watts from it, but what I care about is every watt from my batteries as 70% of time I am on batteries.</p>

<p>I have a mini DC gaming rig with 60 watts GTX 1060 and low powered I3 8th gen and my total consumption is around 110 watts per hour. The PC is meant to work on battery systems as his input voltage is from 6 to 36 voltage wide input range and can use 250 watts max components.
I already own an AC to DC 12 V adpater 300 watts to power it up, but I don't want it to switch off every time I lose the city power suddenly and I would like to keep it on so I bought a bunch of relays to switch between the AC to DC 12 V adapter and the 12 V battery system but none of them worked properly so I refunded them as the PC has to shutdown or restart at every power switching.</p>

<p>Note that of course I won't use inverter, switch the internal power supply to another AC power supply and use normal UPS to increase my power consumption to double of what I already have..... so please don't suggest AC stuff</p>

There is one huge issue though - there seems to be some sort of current leak that prevents the trackpad from functioning correctly. To make it work properly, I have to 'ground' the chassis with one hand. When it's really bad, the whole computer 'hums' with current. Over time, the current seems to increase, leading to very little 'shocks' which feel like the hairs on my forearm are being pulled. It can be discharged by touching a conductive item, like my iPhone(!) or the radiator, but that really isn't ideal. I've put stacks of research into this, so I can tell you that I'm using the grounded (3 pin Uk) adaptor, both directly into the wall socket and/or into surge protector mains adapters, and both with the long lead and the plug that fits onto the line-lump - neither make a difference. It happens when I'm barefooted, when I have my trainers on, on wooden floors and carpeted floors. I've even tried placing both hands on the computer and jumping into the air so that there is no ground. There is no longer a battery attached - after the 2nd one expanded I decided not to buy another. I've read that prolonged use <em>could</em> lead to long-term health risks, but I can't afford to replace the computer, and besides, I've read that the issue is also common on newer Macs.
Is there anything that can be done? All my research up to this point suggests that there isn't, but I'm hoping there's a Super User with a solution.

<p>Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is a technical standard defined by Intel that specifies the operation of Serial ATA (SATA) disk controllers. When it is supported by your operating system and PC hardware, you will get the benefits of features such as native command queuing and hot swapping. For an older OS like Windows XP which does not support AHCI mode out of the box, without OEM-supplied drivers, it is possible to turn on the legacy (IDE) mode in the BIOS to get it to install properly. If your installed your Windows 7 or Windows 8 accidentally in the legacy IDE mode, and want to switch to the AHCI mode, Windows will not boot after you switch from IDE to AHCI in the BIOS.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>This question aims on solving this problem with Windows Vista 32-bit installed on a SATA drive in BIOS IDE mode, as to how exactly to proceed when one wants to switch to AHCI without OS re-installation.</p>

"1221534","Requests per second between a Web Browser vs a Web Scrapper","<p>My understanding:
When a Web Browser makes a request to view a page, the server responds back with the HTML.  Then the Web Browser renders that HTML code, it sends requests for each Embedded Object (such as images) it sees in the HTML to the server in less than a second (give or take).  However, using a Web Scrapper I make a request to the server grabbing only the HTML and not rendering the HTML at all.</p>

<p>Proper etiquette for Web Scrapping says that you should limit your requests to one per second at a maximum to not overload the server.</p>

<p>So, why is it not a problem when the Web Browser sends a request for each Embedded Object (multiple requests withing a second), but it is for a Web Scrapper to send multiple requests a second, just for the HTML source for different pages?</p>

<p>There is only one apparently abstract upside of using Lightsail, simplicity, or significantly simplified interface.</p>

<p>Also, the first page of Lightsail talks about lower charges. My question is how is it considered to reduce charges compared to EC2? Consider $5 Lightsail plan which charges <strong>$0.0067/hour</strong> of an instance (which is the cheapest) where EC2's same type of instance (t2.nano) costs just <strong>$0.0059/hour</strong>.</p>

<p>What am I missing? A detailed price comparison would be much appreciated showing how Lightsail costs lower as advertised.</p>

<p>After some talking with lecturers and other computer enthusiast, I've come under the impression that it would important to partition your drives: keep OS and files separate, extra partition for paging/swapping, restoration partitions, a partition for keeping logs etc. Talking about this topic with people gives me different results though, from people saying it would be practically pointless to people being quite adamant on their neccessity.</p>

<p>Honestly, I'm confused. Who should I trust? Is partitioning an SSD worth it or not?</p>

<p>I have a linux application which runs on its own host.  Everything works on the host.  Most users use Windows 10.  My idea is to start the linux application from Windows 10 and then start up a Windows 10 browser which will connect to linux application serving a web page.</p>

<p>I would like to have a Windows 10 program/script where I can launch and then detach (ideally) that running process.  My Windows knowledge is limited.</p>

<p>A couple of caveats:</p>

<p>1) It would need to be a ""portable program/script"" that did not need to be installed.  Does Windows 10 have a scripting language or maybe use .net??</p>

<p>2) A GUI would be nice.  Ideally one with a ""launch"" and a ""cancel"".  Even better a confirmation textbox once the Linux application has started.</p>

<p>3) The machines DO NOT have WSL and (generally) it can't be added.</p>

<p>I'm looking for high-level guidance on the approach.  Really just the fundamental question of which toolset should I use (Powershell, C#, Go, etc). I can work on coding it up.</p>

I want to have all of my main documents (on the order of 50 GB) always synchronized to a server, both as a backup and to be able to access it whenever I need from my phone or someone else's computer. </p>

<p>How do I accomplish this? That is, what service would allow me to synchronize the same filesystem from two different OSes without issue?</p>

<p>I've found that I can trick Dropbox into syncing the same folder from both from both operating systems without going crazy, but their pricing doesn't work for me. Is there any other software that can do this?</p>

massive duplication trying to do the above. </li>

it and causes duplication. </li>

Specifically, just to name a few, things like DNS, Avahi, zeroconf, mDNS, Bonjour, NetBIOS, WINS, or even manual hosts files. Some of these are, I believe, different terms for basically the same thing. Some use decentralized technologies, others rely on DHCP to distribute central addresses.</p>

<p>How do current common operating systems go through these different, possibly conflicting, name resolution techniques? What order do they use? Do different OSes have different behaviors?</p>

<p>When one asks for the IP of <code>foobar</code>, when is the local search domain appended to the name -- after initial name resolution fails, before it asks something on the network, or some other time? Can (and/or do) DNS resolvers add search domains when trying to find an entry in their tables?</p>

<p>Why did the behavior of my clients change when I specified a local search domain (as opposed to blank) in my router?</p>

<p>Some of these methods support and/or use the <code>.local</code> tld/search domain. Is this only an Avahi thing?</p>

<p>How does adding a <code>.</code> on the end of a domain change things? Does this simply prevent searching ""local domain""? When I lookup <code>google.com</code>, why don't I need the trailing <code>.</code>?</p>

<p>Why doesn't my DNS resolver search for <code>google.com.local</code> or <code>google.com.MyLocalSearchDomain</code>?</p>

<p>Can you have nested search domains?</p>

<p>Are NetBIOS and WINS the same thing? What about avahi, bonjour, and others?</p>

<p>Follow up question: how do each of these services work? I understand that DNS uses a more conventional style of (essentially) one central server that each client is configured to use. However, the decentralized methods must use some other techniques to auto-discover names. How do those work?</p>

The reason is purely to have them ""grouped"" in different ""taskbar groups"", and nothing else.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I forget about this, and to open a new cmd.exe, I simply middle-click that Taskbar icon to open a new cmd.exe. Then I type a command such as ""dir"", and then it spits out a bunch of nonsense, including:</p>

<pre><code>DNS bad key.
</code></pre>

<p>This only happens if I accidentally use the cmd-2.exe. Not if I open the ""real"" cmd.exe. So it's not a ""practical"" problem.</p>

<p>However, I wonder why that message is ever printed at all. It's apparently failing to do some kind of DNS lookup or something? Why is DNS involved at all with me typing ""dir"" to list files in my local computer? I have no network set up, no ""cloud drives"", nothing like that whatsoever. It scares me that (apparently) there are DNS queries being made when I type ""dir"".</p>

<p>There are a few solutions for collaborating in Anki but generally, they involve JSON and Github etc. I repeat what I wrote in the previous paragraph: the members of my team think Excel is complicated (and most of them are middle-aged). I am not gonna introduce them to version control.</p>

<p>How can I make this collaboration effort simple enough? To give an example of what I think people will manage: if I could create a Google Sheet with columns named ""frontside"", ""backside"", ""image"", ""sound"" (pronunciation), ""sample sentence"" and maybe a few more I think most of them would understand and manage. (And Google Docs would take care of the version control.)</p>

<p>But then there is the problem that we are all novices learning a new language -> quite a few of the entries might be questionable and need editing and so on. In other words, we <strong>ALSO</strong> need a method to edit an existing note avoiding duplicates and similar issues.</p>

<p>Everything would be easy if Anki's webservice would allow ""locking"" of notes (and a smart method to modify the database) but it doesn't. Instead, a lot of operations makes sync-and-merge impossible, instead, you have to up-/download and replace everything.ä</p>

I’m using my router to assign IP addresses based upon a device’s MAC address so they always get the same IP. I plan on using the Ethernet port, but every now and then I might move the machine to a location that doesn’t have a jack available.</p>

<p>I’d like to be able to use the WiFi, but still be able to use the IP address assigned to the wired port.  So if I have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wired Ethernet 172.16.68.67</li>
<li>WiFi Adapter   172.16.68.68</li>

<p>One caveat is that I need to expose this adapter to HyperV so my virtual machines can use this adapter for connectivity.</p>

<p>I'm currently planning to add a personal network inside my room because of several reasons. However to do that, I thought to buy my own router and setup inside room and connect that to Ethernet wall port of the room. Also my <a href=""https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218j"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Synology DS218j NAS</a> will be connected with my personal network. This is the story inside room.</p>

<p>When it comes to outside, there are 4 rooms including mine where having one ethernet port for each room is a must. So I thought to use </p>

<ol>
<li>CAT6 cables for inside the walls and wall to device connectivity</li>
<li>Common router (<a href=""https://www.tp-link.com/no/products/details/cat-5030_TD-W8951ND.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TP-Link W8951ND</a> provided by ISP) - Does not support Gigabit ethernet (Max: 150Mbps)</li>
<li>5 port switch (Still Undecided the model)</li>
<li>Another router for my room (Still Undecided the model)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>So I have few problems and will state and describe them below.</p>

<ol>
<li>My internet connection is more like 20Mbps. So using ISP provided internet router is enough to access the internet. But when it comes to my room router, to be able to communicate in maximum speed with <a href=""https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218j"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Synology DS2018j</a>, it's better to have a Gigabit connectivity. So gigabit router is necessary I think. So my question is, is my conclusion correct? With this setup, would I be able to access 20Mbps internet and high speed gigabit connectivity inside my room?</li>
<li>Can you kindly recommend a router for my personal network and a 5 port switch for this setup?</li>
<li>I have to setup home network as well. So as I explained earlier, above stated devices will be used. But my ISP provided router does not provide an ""<code>Uplink port</code>"" (Router LAN ports are labeled as LAN1, LAN2, LAN3 and LAN4. Not Uplink). So how can I setup one (If necessary) and connect with switch ? </li>
<li>Is there an additional setup should I do when I connect My Router -> Switch -> ISP provided router.</li>

As I am using a Windows 10 Home Edition, the second solution does not work. I tried to install dpedit.msc as instructed here (<a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1018145/windows-starter-edition-home-and-home-premium-do-not-include-gpedit-how-do-i-i"">Windows Starter Edition, Home and Home Premium do not include gpedit, how do I install it?</a>), but for some reason it did not work as demonstrated -- I downloaded that zipped folder and ran the extracted setup.exe file. Following the execution, however, I tried to access gpedit.msc command via RUN as well as START Menu search box, but my laptop failed to locate gpedit.msc.</p>

<p>So I tried the first solution. I looked up regedit and followed everything and changed the value date from 0 to 1. It still did not work, even after I logged off, restarted the computer, and logged back in.</p>

<p>I have a truly insane number of peripherals.   The case, of course, had some bad front panel ports because those front panel headers are usually hot garbage anyway.  Between USB expansion cards to get around the problem and other equipment in the case, my PCI-E slots are full.  I have an HTC Vive, however, and need to open a PCI-E slot on the mainboard in order to install the new wireless adapter's PCI-E receiver.  </p>

<p>What I would like to do is make the older computer that is just managing fans into a slave unit to the primary machine in the case.  I know I can do this over LAN, but part of my goal is to <em>not</em> put the second machine out there for any other computer or device on the network to see.  I want to guarantee exclusive use of all resources on the ""slave"" machine for the ""master"" machine.  I also want to do this at no less than 480Mbps, so that I see very little to no latency on connected USB devices.  I would like the ""slave"" to only run Linux, Win7, or even XP in a pinch but with an NTFS file system I can make use of from the ""master"" Windows 10 machine.  Finally, once the initial setup is complete, I'd like to run the ""slave"" with no monitor, keyboard, or mouse and manage it only from the ""master"" or bios in emergencies.

"1527013","After ""make install"" the executed binary is still the old one","<p>Sorry for my ignorance regarding Unix but I am puzzled about the behaviour of my Ubuntu (Windows subsystem). I built <code>GNU make</code> from source (because the current version in the repository is still at 4.1 which is from 2014 and buggy) and ran <code>sudo make install</code> as last step. The script ran through without problems and in the following you can see the last few actions of the install procedure, correctly copying <code>make</code> from my <code>install</code> to <code>/usr/local/bin/make</code>. The <code>which</code> command was also of the opinion that I was using <code>/usr/local/bin/make</code> but invoking make still gave me version <code>4.1</code> as you can see. Using the full path did the right thing, starting version <code>4.3</code>. How can this happen? I have knowledge from the stone age that Unix used to employ a file system cache or buffer but I thought this was a transparent thing? Where was <code>make V4.1</code> buffered in my system? 
When I opened a new shell, the behaviour was gone, now correctly using <code>4.3</code> when starting <code>make</code>. I know this from the command shell in Windows but can't draw a meaningful connection to the Linux subsystem.</p>

That info typically remains constant across uses, and allows to precisely discriminate among devices sharing the same network access point (e.g. fiber/cable/ADSL box).</p>

<p>To see this in action, head to <a href=""https://whatsmyip.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">whatsmyip.com</a> and scroll down to the bottom left, ""Your computer"". Here is your LAN IP (and unless I missed something, it was not generated locally). That works with a default install of Chrome and Firefox, including in ""private navigation"" mode.</p>

<p>In Firefox, at least that way of obtaining the LAN address can be prevented by going to <code>about:config</code>, getting past the warning, searching <code>media.peerconnection.enabled</code> and setting that to <em>false</em>. If there are practical adverse effects, I did not find these in months of use.</p>

In the worst case, supposing that there's no hardware damage, one can always go there and format the partition where the system is installed, reinstall everything and make things right.</p>

<p>Now in mobile devices people like to say that sometimes ""there's no way to solve the issue"". People usually talk about a device being ""permanently bricked"", and say that ""no matter what there will be no way to correct it"".</p>

<p>But wait a minute, let's talk about Android for simplicity. Android is based on Linux. So in the end of the day, as far as I know, the Android system is just one specific Linux distro tailored for mobile devices, with the pertinent virtual machine installed to run the apps.</p>

<p>How can a <em>software problem</em> caused on the device, be permanent? How can a <em>software problem</em> have no way to be corrected, if it is just a Linux system in the end of the day?</p>

<p>As I said, I've never seen anyone saying ""this computer cannot be fixed, we need to throw it away and buy another one"" by a software issue. This <em>might</em> happen, for hardware issues, because sometimes the price to buy the hardware pieces needed might not be a huge advantage over buying a new computer.</p>

<p>But for software, no one throws a computer aways, we always correct it.</p>

<p>In that case, why concerning mobile devices, people talk about ""permanently bricked"" devices and ""software problems that cannot be solved"" and that might cause the device to be discarded? How can software problems on mobile devices be ""unsolvable""?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's when I wanted to start streaming on Twitch a bit, but my RAM started acting weird. Whenever I would use around 60% memory, the whole computer would start freezing and telling me that it doesn't have enough memory to run an application (For instance, Overwatch wouldnt launch without encounterring this error).</p>

<p><strong>So, the problem is: My computer has 16Go RAM, but won't use more than 60-65%.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I tested each RAM module individually to see if there was one faulty, but they both seemed OK (PC detects it, and I can use the memory without having anything crash)</li>
<li>I ran a memory test (<a href=""https://hcidesign.com/memtest/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://hcidesign.com/memtest/</a>), and used the maximum memory I could.</li>
<li>I checked if my drivers were up to date (not sure if can have an impact)</li>
<li>Ran virus/malware scan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additionnal information</strong> : Sometimes, it will be worse, and by that I mean that I only have Google Chrome opened, and my computer will shut it down because it doesn't have enough memory (especially since the latest Chrome update). When I just remove / put the RAM back in its place, it will sometimes go back to the ""usual"" 60-65% RAM limit.</p>

<p>Anyone has an idea of what I can do to fix this problem?</p>

"1021221","Is it legally possible to install Windows 7/8/10 Home/Pro into a VM on a rented virtual server","<p>I'm planning on build an infrastructure for myself and possibly sharing it with others, which includes a few server applications which I currently run on my own PC.</p>

<ul>
<li>git server : GitBlit runs on linux so it's okay</li>
<li>agile/ticket management :  kanboard this just needs a webserver, should work under linux as well</li>
<li>file sharing, this is also pretty standard so no problem here</li>
<li>build server : Jenkins ci</li>
</ul>

<p>However the build server will need to build windows apps mostly, I can opt for cross compiling or some other workaround that doesn't involve an actual windows install however I would like to consider that as the last option.</p>

<p>I've considered mac development and dropped it since, it obviously needs a real mac, that is the best option, so in the case of windows I'm considering the same thing, getting a legal copy and installing it on a server with a linux distro.</p>

<p>The question is that is it legal to install a legit copy of windows ( 7/8/10 ) that is intended for personal use ( home or pro version ) on a rented virtual server as a VM.</p>

<p>So the scenario is that I rent a virtual server like this one : <a href=""https://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_vserver/cx20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_vserver/cx20</a> with a linux distro. </p>

<p>Then I will install Virtual Box on the server and install my windows copy on a Virtual Box VM.</p>

<p>I guess there is a reason that Windows Server editions exist and I wonder whenever this kind of setup is legal or not taking into account the fact that the Windows installed on the VM will not be accessible from the outside world since it will only work as a slave for Jenkins to do jobs that need Windows platform.</p>

I regularly monitor cpu temperature during usage and cpu core temperatures did not rise above 70 C during usage. So, I want to know if it is normal for cpu and serverboard pins to get black due to heavy usage. If yes, will Intel still reject warranty claim since I have used server too heavily.

<pre><code>   --init-timeout=&lt;n&gt;
       Timeout (in seconds) between the moment the connection is established
       and the client request is received (typically a rather low value,
       since that should be basically immediate).

   --timeout=&lt;n&gt;
       Timeout (in seconds) for specific client sub-requests. This includes
       the time it takes for the server to process the sub-request and the
       time spent waiting for the next client's request.
</code></pre>

<p>I feel relatively comfortable setting <code>--init-timeout</code> to something like 30s, seeing as the man page says ""typically a rather low value"", but I could use some guidance for what is a reasonable value of <code>--timeout</code>, seeing as it says it ""includes the time it takes for the server to process the sub-request"", which seems like it could be quite a long time.</p>

<p>Previously, and on other machines, I hit Windows+R to open the ""Run"" box, where I type a command to execute. The next time I open the Run box, previous commands appear there and can be found by scrolling or starting to type.</p>

<p>Now, on this machine, the Run box always comes up empty and I have to type all commands completely each time.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to re-enable that cache?</p>

"1144389","Make Task Manager Open on Second Monitor By Default","<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> On multi-monitor setups, is there a way to make a single program (such as the task manager) open on the second monitor's screen by default, <em>without</em> making all programs open on the second monitor?</p>

<p><strong>Long Version:</strong> One issue I have with Skyrim is that it sometimes crashes.  Sometimes it'll just CTD.  Other times, it remains in a frozen state and cannot be closed.  I can alt-tab to another window, but the skyrim ""window"" (if you can call it that, it's fullscreen) remains on top of any other windows.</p>

<p>I am using two monitors, so it'll only stay above windows on the primary monitor.  But that doesn't help much, as any programs I open are opened on the primary monitor.  So, pressing CTRL-ALT-Delete to get the task manager doesn't help, because it opens on the first window, so it remains under skyrim's fullscreen window.</p>

<p>If I open the task manager before starting skyrim, move it to the second monitor, then close it, it will be in the last place it was when it was closed for the rest of my login session.  But if I log out or reboot, it is back to its default location, on the primary monitor's screen.</p>

<p>Is there any way to change the task manager's default opening location to the second monitor's screen area?</p>

<p>Note that simply making the second monitor the primary one is not a viable solution, and neither is making all programs open on the secondary monitor by default.  Both of those methods would mean Skyrim opens on the second monitor by default along with the task manager, putting me back to square one.  Plus, the second monitor has a smaller resolution than the primary (1920x1080 vs 1440x900).</p>

"1233458","Remove `Set as desktop background` option?","<p>Using Windows 8.1. If I need to change the desktop, I can right-click the desktop, select <code>Personalise</code> then <code>Desktop Background</code> in the lower left. This is fine because the background is usually set once and then changed infrequently thereafter.</p>

<p>However, Windows offers the option <code>Set as desktop background</code> when you right-click an image file (BMP, PNG, etc).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/zkguW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/zkguW.png"" alt=""Set as background image""></a></p>

<p>Since changing the background is done rarely, this seems overkill. This afternoon I accidentally clicked the option. I'd long since forgotten where the original background image was buried in my file structure (and there is no <code>Undo</code>!). After about an hr of searching, I eventually found the file and restored my background.</p>

<p>Can this option be removed from the context menu to prevent future accidents?</p>

<p>However, the conditional formatting rules don't seem to work in that way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each time I create such rule, the column reference gets translated into an absolute cell reference, which is wrong, because it doesn't scale as the table grows.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>=DeptSales[Sales Amount]</code> gets translated to <code>=$D$2:$D$34</code></p>

<ul>
<li>For some reason even when editing the rule, I am unable to use the column reference, an error gets displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>=WENN(ISTLEER(D2:D34);FALSCH;ZÄHLENWENN(Name_in_system;D2:D34)=0)</code> works, <code>=WENN(ISTLEER(DeptSales[Sales Amount]);FALSCH;ZÄHLENWENN(Name_in_system;DeptSales[Sales Amount])=0)</code> results in an error (shown below)</p>

I want to have both GPUs installed.</p>

<p>The issue is that if I install the 1080 Ti on the x16 PCI lane where my current GPU is, then the only option for the GT710 is 3 slots lower (x8 PCI). Since the new card is quite thick, if I place them like this they will be very close to each other like 1cm or less. As a result the GT710 will be mostly covering one of the two fans of the 1080 Ti. Note that in this tower, the PSU is located at the bottom just a bit lower than the last PCI lane. This PSU is flowing air upwards.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask whether this is OK or it can damage my new GPU in the long term due to insufficient cooling.</p>

<p>There are mounting holes for a 140mm fan on the side of the case. I can install a fan there and set it to blow air either to or from the PCI lanes area of the motherboard but I don't know whether this can help.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Each row represents instances that an employee is working on a task, in this case, within 6:43 AM to 2:11 PM. So using common sense, you would deduct the 'End Time' to the 'Start Time' to get the length of 'Engaged' time. But that's not the Engaged time. That's the 'Task Length'. The length of time he took to finish 1 task.</p>

<p>The issue here is 1 employee can work on multiple tasks at the same time. If you look at row 3 (8:01AM to 9:43AM), the employee took more than 1 hour to complete 1 task. While doing that specific task, he started doing other tasks in rows 4 5 and 6.</p>

<p>so thinking about 'Engaged Time' he was engaged from 8:01AM until 9:55AM. I cannot think of a dynamic formula that will do this automatically for the entire table. Another issue is that, this is a data set for just 1 employee for 1 day. I have 10 employees that work 5 days a week. They produce roughly 3,000 rows of data in 1 month. Can you suggest a formula, pivot table technique, or VBA code for me to crunch the numbers dynamically?</p>

"1025872","How can I supress zero values in a LibreOffice line line chart?","<p>I'm making a line chart counting users of various releases of a piece of software over the years. This is a very spiky line chart, where as new versions come into existence and then retire, lines should start arbitrarily along the X axis. However, instead, since there is a ""0"" in my data for the periods where that version didn't even exist yet, I instead get all values starting at 0,0, with a flat line along the bottom.</p>

<p>It's not a big deal, but it's irritating my sense of chart aesthetics. How can I suppress this? I found various options to not <em>show</em> zero-value cells in the data itself (either on-screen or when printing), but they don't seem to affect the line chart.</p>

When I boot it, I get the usual starting animation, the harddisk LED blinks but then the screen gets black and nothing more happens. No sound, so activity, no changes when I press any keys or the mouse buttons.</p>

<p>When I start the computer with a Fedora 23 Linux live system from usb pendrive, it has no problems, everything works out of the box.</p>

"1369253","What actually happens when installing hardware drivers from a CD in Windows?","<p>I am curious as to what happens in Windows in the background when you install device drivers from a CD for a particular piece of I/O.  My assumptions is that the only things that can be happening are transferring files to the drive form the CD, altering registry keys, and maybe changing some environment variables.</p>

<p>Is that all that happens in the background?  How exactly does the OS gain the ability to communicate to a device?  When I was young I used to think there was a fundamental difference between installing a program/driver from a CD and just inserting a CD and copying over files to specific directories, but now I'm not so sure there is any difference.</p>

<p>My questions arose because of my background in automated test equipment.  I was trying to develop a conceptual framework of understanding that when you connect a measurement instrument to a windows machine over GPIB or whatever, that you must install both hardware level drivers so that the OS can communicate with the device, but then you also install software drivers (API? libraries?) that you then use as part of a larger software package to compile a .dll that can be called programmatically to control the instrument. That got me wondering what is really the difference between installing the hardware-level driver for the OS, and installing software libraries for your automated test programs to use.</p>

<p>Are any of my assumptions and understanding just fundamentally wrong?</p>

"1369882","Creating multiple users in windows","<p>When I create multiple users in ubuntu it's much more convienient. In ubuntu, we get seperate hard drives management for all users created. One user cannot access the files of the other user, unless s/he is  the superuser. But, in windows, it seems like all  the files are accessible, only the desktop is cleared up and the programs are defaulted. It's not really convienient if other users created can access your files.    </p>

<p>This is the case now for me, I have created a new user,  and password protected my account, but, say my brother accesses  my PC,  and signs in into  the account  created for him, then he accesses my files in D: from his account.    </p>

<p>Sometimes, the RDP window will just stop showing screen updates, as if the remote screen were ""frozen"". It <em>looks like</em> the RDP session is stuck, but it isn't:</p>

<ul>
<li>After reconnecting, I can see that all the keyboard and mouse events I sent <em>after</em> the screen froze have been processed.</li>
<li>The mouse cursor still changes according to what is <em>really</em> underneath: If I drag and drop a window a few centimeters, the window will still be shown at the <em>old</em> position, but the cursor changes to the ""resize"" cursor when I hover over the <em>new</em> position of the border of the window.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not a temporary network issue either:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I wait, the screen just stays frozen (I tried it for many minutes while writing this question).</li>
<li>If I close the RDP session and reconnect, everything works fine again (until it freezes again at some random time).</li>
</ul>

<p>Switching from full-screen to windowed mode and vice versa doesn't help. It looks like a bug in the RDP client or server (both machines are Windows 10 1909).</p>

<p>Work purposes meaning video and photoshop editing. I'm a programmer and coding software doesn't require any power at all really...</p>

<p>I'm currently using a mid 2010 macbook pro 17 inch and have been using a mac since 2008. Always thought they're nice and after the new release of the latest macbooks it made me realize I won't have a good portable replacement for at least 4 more years. So.. I'm thinking of offloading the heavy duty stuff onto a desktop.</p>

<p>I'm looking at spending 1-1.5k on a computer/parts. In the long run (5 years?) does it seem reasonable for me to buy a tower and toss parts at it? That way when a newer CPU comes around, I can swap out the cpu's? (e.g. i9 processor if/when it comes out). So my cost of upgrading would be a CPU and not an entire computer?</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the only thing that would ever change is the mother board and CPU, then I could simply plug in all the other things, like ram and hook up the fans to it again right? What's 400-500 vs a whole nother 1.5k to have ""the best"", AND I'd have the latest USB, thunderbolt etc plugs that are the current speeds right? (stuck with usb 2.0 on mac lol). AND I'd get the added benefit of being able to swap out graphic cards if I ever (never) want to play a game or something like that.</p>

<p>My RDP session to my new laptop would be stable as long as I was doing something within the session, even just moving the mouse around every couple of moments. The overnight backup went through without problem last night. But if I left the laptop idle for more than a few moments and returned back to it, it was disconnected and would take many seconds to reconnect. Very annoying.</p>

<p>Scenario:
Windows 2012 server used as my main computer with multiple monitors. I use it to connect to my laptop using RDP (I prefer big , multiple monitors when working).</p>

<p>Server has two NICs to the router on separate IPs (one is emergency backup). Cisco WAP371 directly connected to the router for 5GHz for an android tablet, cell phone, LG TV, and laptop. Cisco WAP121 connected via a switch from the router for an HP printer (cause it won't connect on the WAP371). A second printer is attached via the switch connected to the router. Oh, and my old laptop to one or the other WAP.</p>

<p>I read through as many posts as I could and have tried resetting all the things everyone talks about on the NICs, in services, in Windows, firewalls, etc.</p>

<p>Finally set up pings on my server and laptops to all devices and each other and watched.</p>

<p>I was getting ping timeouts on the main NIC to the the router, both laptops, and both WAPs - not always at the same time. But no timeout to the printer on the WAP121! That was weird.</p>

<p>I tried connecting the laptop to the WAP121 and no change. Turned off all devices one by one and shutdown all VMs. No change. Tried changing cables.</p>

<p>With many of the alterations, the pings would all work again for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Eventually I switched the roles on the NICs using my backup NIC for the main traffic to the router. And voila! it all worked! And the network was so much faster!</p>

<p>The only explanation I can come up with is that the ""bad"" NIC worked marginally on larger packets. I cannot explain why the pings timed out to the router port, but worked okay on the printer on the WAP121 even though those pings had to go though the same router port. (I confirmed by disconnecting the second cable to the router.)</p>

<p>So for anyone trying to diagnose RDP timeouts, beware that there could be a flaky Ethernet port somewhere along the traffic pathway that cannot be determined simply by studying which ports timed out on pings.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

"1151039","How can I delete these old system/driver files on Windows 10?","<p>I've got a Windows 10 tablet that was upgraded from Windows 8. As a result of the upgrade, it kept some files in the C:\Windows.old folder. I ran the Disk Cleanup utility (diskmgr) to try and delete those, by checking the box to delete ""Previous Windows Installation(s)."" This did delete most of the contents of that folder; however, six system files were left in there, actually two copies of these three files:</p>

<ul>
<li>iaiogpioe.sys</li>
<li>iaio2ce.sys</li>
<li>iaiospi.sys</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried to delete those and it said I couldn't because they were owned by TrustedInstaller. So, naturally, I changed ownership on those files to Administrators, and then gave Administrators full access. But then when I tried deleting them, it said they were in use by the system and so couldn't be deleted.</p>

<p>I was able to move them out of the C:\Windows.old folder, and into my Documents folder, thereby allowing me to delete the Windows.old folder. However, I still can't delete those six files which are now in my Documents folders. I am even able to rename them. I tried changing their file extension from ""sys"" to ""pancakes."" That works fine, but I am still unable to delete.</p>

<p>I even tried a third-party program called LockHunter, which indicated that the files weren't in use by any applications; however it was unable to delete them. It said I could attempt to delete the files upon reboot, but that, too, failed.</p>

This is largely because most common ransomware kits steal and break password hashes (ie mimikatz), to use in further exploitation of the network.</p>

<p>The purpose of this question is to take further deep insight into the way ATX Board &amp; PSU work together.</p>

<p>Within 25 – 30 minutes of starting, PC just shuts off as if power button is pressed. It’s an old PC with Socket 754 board and AMD Sempron CPU.</p>

<p>I eliminated the following and below is the necessary information</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There was no overheating. Temperature never crossed 40 C (104 F)</p></li>
<li><p>Motherboard was not faulty. This issue did not occur with another PSU. With healthy PSU, system ran continuously for 3 hours and I tested it 4 more times for that much long duration</p></li>
<li><p>PSU in question was 450W ATX SMPS. Not from international brands like Cooler Master or Corsair or so.</p></li>
<li><p>All HDD, DVD removed, system was just at BIOS and nothing more</p></li>
<li><p>Once abruptly shut down, it would fail to start again for at least 15 – 20 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>PSU fan spins well when it starts</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously as mentioned earlier, I have nailed it down to faulty PSU. However the same problematic PSU in paperclip test passes and using my DMM I have checked all voltages they are just good for over an hour.</p>

<p>What are the reasons that the system shuts down under this scenario. 
Could it be that the…</p>

<p>PSU loses PowerOK after sometime under load?</p>

<p>Voltages fluctuates beyond what is tolerance stated by ATX specs, under load but not when only fan is connected and no motherboard?</p>

<p>Anything to do with temperature within PSU?</p>

<p>Further, what is that integration of ATX board and ATX PSU that results into this behavior i.e. abrupt shutdown of PSU?</p>

<li><p>I have been seeing exporting shell variable to extend PATH variable method everywhere. But it is only applied in one shell. Because every shell has its own file for initialization.

</ul>

Previous versions of Windows would usually come preinstalled with a generic video driver, and the first thing I would do after install would be to go the Nvidia website to download and install the latest official driver for my card. This time, I noticed that Windows automatically installed what already appears to be the official Nvidia driver (including all the usual Nvidia apps and menus). Should I trust this to be the correct and latest version of the driver? Or should I still manually download and install the one from the Nvidia website in any case?</p>

"1539218","How can it be that most software for Windows treats each single update as if you are installing the software for the first time?","<p>Notepad++ just nagged me about a new version for the millionth time. Finally giving in, this time I clicked ""OK"" with a sigh instead of ""Cancel"". And so it started downloading the latest version, but once it had done so, it didn't just, you know, <em>update</em> Notepad++, which I obviously already have installed, to the latest version.</p>

<p>Instead, it opened the installer which acted as if I had just installed my computer and downloaded the initial Notepad++ installation file. I had to click ""Next"" many times and make all the same choices I've already done on this computer.</p>

<p>Every. Single. Time.</p>

<p>Why is it that software developers don't seem to understand/care about their users' experience to this extent? How hard can it be to build in a feature into the installer where if you open it with a ""/silent-upgrade"" flag or something along those lines, it ignores the whole GUI setup process and just installs the new files?</p>

<p>I don't understand it. Even if they ""are lazy"", they must be using and testing the software themselves, and since they keep making so many updates to the program, why can't they do this small, obvious fix? Why won't they?</p>

<p>Before you answer that they want yet another opportunity to trick you into installing a bunch of malware and/or enable ""telemetry"", Notepad++ (and some other FOSS I use) don't have any such things in their installers, so it cannot even be explained by this. It's just a pointless waste of time where I have to wait for the GUI to appear and click ""next"" a bunch of times, for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>Some software actually <em>has</em> such flags, for example pgAdmin 4, which nags you to upgrade until you click the link inside the program, which then opens up their webpage where you have to manually download the entire new installer and then manually run it. However, it has undocumented flags which you can use which do exactly what I described above; just install the new version and skip the pointless installer.</p>

<p>pgAdmin 4 also has no ""fishy"" stuff in its installer, so again it cannot be explained by that.</p>

<p>Why do they actively go out of their way to hide these things and (in practice) force the user to click through a GUI installer every time the software updates? No matter how ""lazy"" you think I am, it has made me extremely reluctant toward updating my software because it's such a mental chore. You'd think they would want users to have the latest stable version rather than postponing updates perpetually.</p>

It's stuck at 100% of one of the ""cores"", which equates to about 3% CPU. Unfortunately, the application can't be easily modified or made multi-threaded. We're hitting application performance problems, and it's pretty clear that CPU is the bottleneck.</p>

<p>We have a spec for other hardware, a 2xQuad core Xeon 3GHz machine. But what I don't know is whether this would be a better spec for the application. My immediate instinct is that the clock speed is faster and there are less cores (8 rather than 32) so overall the application would run better. But I'm conscious that it's not that simple, on the 32-way machine lots of those ""cores"" are hyper-threading and I don't know whether simple-minded calculations apply.</p>

<p>I'm just looking for a rough ""rule of thumb"" approach to take in evaluating the 2 machines. I know that to get a true answer, I'd need to do proper tests, but I don't want to spend the time and effort doing so if it's unlikely to help.</p>

<p>On some Linux desktops, this also works in dual display setups: if I have two screens next to each other, I can arrange up to four windows next to each other in this manner.</p>

<p>On Windows 7, this behavior seems to work only on the outer edges. I can make one window take up the left half of the left screen, but not the right half of the left screen. Is this behavior configurable, and if so, where?</p>

But stream A suffer a delay at the beginning of transmission (in the range 1s to 10sec) with respect to stream B. At the receiver, I need to synchronize the streams, so what I need is a (python, C, C++, Java), program that open the socket to receive B (to a given IP:port) buffer the data for (example. 10sec), and then start to: 1) read the data from B and copy them in a queue. 2) read data from the front of the queue and send them to another ip:port. In this way, in the latter port I can read them, synchronized with A. I don't know if netcat, or other tools can do this with some options, or if there are already programs (under Windows 10) that can be used to do this. Eventually I can write the code, but I really like to know some directions, for a solution. Thanks.</p>

  <p>From my test and experience, it is not achiveable [sic] to disable the automatically list feature in OWA. You can share your feedback via the following link: </p>

In this way, the system will not automatically number list. </p>

<p>If needed, I plan to write a couple of client/server scripts in bash to perform this testing using <code>nc</code> (netcat), but if a pre-existing solution captures what I'm trying to do, please let me know.</p>

<p>First, I'll determine how much data I can send in 1 second between my arbitrary hosts. We'll call this the ""payload"". Initial tests show the payload to be ~50 MB.</p>

<p>Then I'll execute the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client sends the payload to the server.</li>
<li>When the server receives the entire payload, it will immediately respond by sending a payload to the client.</li>
<li>When the client receives the entire payload, it will sleep for 30 seconds.
Go to 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>By doing so, I will receive the following data (bidirectional bandwidth &amp; latency):</p>

<ol>
<li>By recording the <code>time</code> to execute the <code>nc</code> from client to server in (1), I will get the bandwidth sending data from client to server.</li>
<li>By recording the <code>time</code> to execute the <code>nc</code> from server to client in (2), I will get the bandwidth sending data from the server to the client.</li>
<li>Somehow I'll determine packet latency, perhaps using a monitoring tool or diff-ing the timestamps between the first packet of the payload sent from the source and the first packet of the payload received on the destination.</li>

  Windows 10 activates automatically using a digital license and doesn’t

<p>Normally I charge it with a Type C 5V/3A charger, and a USB Type C to Type C cable:</p>

<p>This works fine. This is the original charger that came with the phone.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering, what if I get a dual charger like this:<br>
(note that those are two Type A USB ports, not Type C)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/c9CgV.jpg"" alt=""USB dual charger""></p>

<p>Along with a USB Type A to Type C cable:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Immbq.jpg"" alt=""USB A-to-C cable""></p>

<p>Will this allow me to charge just as fast? And in that case, should I use the QuickCharge 3.0 port, or the 'regular' 5V/3A (non-QC) port? Or can I expect them both to work?</p>

<p>Basically what I'm wondering is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can I get my Nexus 5X to fast charge over a Type A to Type C cable as well, provided that the charger does indeed deliver 5V/3A through the Type A output?</p></li>
<li><p>The Nexus 5X does not support QuickCharge 3.0. But considering that QC3.0 specifies support for various voltage and amperage ranges including 3.6V-6.5V/3A, could I still expect my Nexus 5X to fast charge through a QC3.0 charger? (which would again be through a Type A to Type C cable)</p></li>

<p>I've just found that they can't do so using Firefox any more, and the firefox bug/feature states that FTP is heading for being ""clearly deprecated"" and FTP over TLS is being tagged as WONTFIX (Mozilla <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1219201"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link1</a> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85464"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link2</a> but see also <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1463440"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link3</a>).

<p>I do provide SMB on the LAN but not WAN, and I'd like to not start running a full web server locally if avoidable. (Because having far greater unnecessary functionality also means scope for a wider attack surface: best avoided if not needed).</p>

<p>Given that scenario, what is the substitute expectation for users who have been using FTPS (or who have been using FTP and want to add TLS transport) to be doing instead?</p>

<p>I assume a not-especially-technical client user who wants it to ""just work""within the default OS or their usual browser, and not download specific FTP/client software just to add that capability. The functionality they need is as simple as <em>""enter URI -> authenticate -> get file system root listing -> browse &amp; search directories and up/download files""</em>.</p>

<p>Of course decent FTP clients will support this and will exist for many years, but the point was that an ftp(s):// URI has been usable in browsers for decades but now clearly won't be (or won't reliably be). So what should I do, to give them what they need/expect insead?</p>

<p>Note: I'm an absolute newbie when it comes to code signing and software certificates. I've tried to search and read about how to solve our particular problem, but have found nothing resembling online.</p>

<p>Until now, code signing has not been an issue for us, as we are working on embedded systems, based on Windows, but where we deliver turn-key solutions.
Then our antivirus (which is mandatory!) took a dislike for several of our binaries (across all projects), and there appear to be no real pattern in what it dislikes. After weeks of talking with the vendor of the antivirus, we have found that the solution for us, is is that our developers have a folder excluded from scanning (used for building the software), and that we implement code signing, while having our certificate white-listed in the anti-virus application (used for limited in-house distribution and testing of our software).</p>

<p>So for now we will be employing code-signing, not for security, but simply to be allowed to do our work. The antivirus vendor has informed us that self-signed certificates can not be white-listed - even thought that would have made sense.</p>

<p>Our developers are located at five locations worldwide, and we are looking for the simplest possible solution for us to ensure they can all perform code-signing (as it will otherwise not be possible for them to test the code they build).</p>

<p>We hope some sort of certificate distribution is possible, perhaps even by using Active Directory?</p>

<p>In the not-too-distant future we will need to do code signing to actually validate our software security, so if we are using the distributed certificate, would it then still be ""safe"" to use for validation? I guess not - which makes me wonder if we could have two certificates, and sign with both? One certificate would then be distributed, and allow us to build and test, then other would be used for actually publishing.</p>

<p>We will probably go with an Microsoft Authenticode Certificate - unless there are good reasons not to.</p>

<p>However, as far as I can understand, Microsoft has since February 1st 2017, required a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to be used in the code-signing process - we hope that does not mean each developer need their own HSM in their computer!</p>

<p>So to sum up my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>For code-signing of Windows binaries, are a HSM certificate required, or are there other better alternatives (in this situation).</li>
<li>What options are there to distribute a certificate among developers? Using AD would be nice, as it's already in place globally.</li>
<li>In a distributed setup, would it be possible to keep the signing certificate a secret?</li>
<li>Would double signing be an option to increase security? (One signing to beat the antivirus while testing, another for actual security of the released software)</li>
<li>Do you have a better solution for us to consider?</li>
</ol>

<p>For example the mod has five .hak files, one .mod file, and one .tlk file. The .hak files go in the game's ""hak"" folder, the .mod file goes in the ""modules"" folder, and the .tlk file goes in the ""tlk"" folder.</p>

<p>A mod can have as much as 1000 files so it will take a lot of time to manually select the files across the different folders and move them while testing. I could make an archive file for each mod and have it simply extract its contents in the game's folder for quick install, but I'll still have to manually delete the files when removing it and try not to delete core files by accident.</p>

<p>I suppose it will also work if their extensions are no longer valid.</p>

<p>This is a problem as I've long had my pc and monitor in the corner next to the window. I could move the table away from it and put it where my bookshelf is now. But where my pc is now it has easy access to the only phone line in the room and it would be a hassle to unload and move the bookshelf. Also I would have to put the bookshelf in the corner where the monitor was and sunlight isn't good for books either.</p>

<p>I've included a picture of my current monitor on the table I have set up. I want to ask, is that too close to the window? </p>

<p>How can I forward subdomain.example.com to localhost:25565?</p>

<ul>
<li>without paying for a service  </li>
<li>without router admin access  </li>
<li>without exposing more than port 25565 of localhost </li>
<li>using Google Domains  </li>
<li>localhost is Windows 10</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reasoning</h2>

<p>I am running a Minecraft server on my desktop that runs on port 25565. I want my friends to be able to connect to the server using a subdomain of a domain I already own. Currently, I am using ngrok 
and my friends connect to <code>0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:[redacted]</code>. However, the port keeps changing which is discouraging them from playing as they have to ask me for the port number every time it changes (at least once a day). I understand why ngrok do this, I'm just using the free tier after all. However, the paid version of ngrok that provides a static subdomain, costs nearly as much as it would to pay for a minecraft server. </p>

<h2>Attempts</h2>

<p><strong>Temporary subdomain forward</strong>: can only forward to a http destination and ngrok and minecraft require TCP.<br>
<strong>Dynamic DNS</strong>: I followed <a href=""https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google's tutorial</a> with a Windows port of DDclient but, as far as I can tell, DDNS does not support forwarding to a port.<br>
<strong>Other tunneling services</strong>: localtunnel (serverless.social) does not appear to support TCP; localxpose and others charge for TCP; serveo and others are now offline. In essence, I can't find any suitable alternatives to ngrok but I'm still looking.</p>

<p>I am also talking to the Google Domains support team but thought I'd ask to see if anyone knows a way already.</p>

<p>which was successful except one major problem: it has added the key for user <code>username_gmail_com</code> and will only allow me to ssh to my VM as that user:</p>

<p><code>ssh username_gmail_com@myinstance</code></p>

<p>That's very inconvenient, because my code is at <code>/home/username</code> owned by <code>username</code>. So instead, I would like to be able to</p>

<p><code>ssh username@myinstance</code></p>

<p>Where did I go wrong, and what would be the best way to solve this?</p>

<p>ps. I also tried</p>

<p><code>
gcloud compute ssh username_gmail_com@myinstance
gcloud compute ssh username@myinstance
</code></p>

<p>which both give the <code>WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.</code> and offer to create it (which I haven't).</p>

<p><strong>===Edit</strong></p>

<p>I disabled OS Login, but then I can't ssh from my local console at all (of course, because that's what the docs say). The web interface console then logs in with the old username.</p>

<p>So with OS Login disabled for my project, Compute uses <code>username</code>. With OS Login enabled, it uses <code>username_gmail_com</code>. Any pointers to docs explaining why this is and how we can influence would be welcome.</p>

<p>My solution likely lies in reconfiguring the server for the new user (it's entirely possible that recreating it is easier). If anyone knows any other solution I'm interested to learn.</p>

"1159342","Booted up PC for first time in a year and it worked fine, left it running for four hours, then shut it down. Now it power cycles when I turn it on","<p>My PC was in storage for about a year and last night I booted it up for the first time. It started up and ran fine without any issues and I left it running for about four hours, then turned it off. This morning I turned it on and it's power cycling, turning on for about 1 second, then immediately turning off. I does this about every five seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Here's what I've tried</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've reseated the RAM sticks</li>
<li>I've tried booting up without the RAM sticks installed</li>
<li>I've reseated the two power connectors to the motherboard, from the PSU</li>

<li>I've reseated the video card</li>
<li>I've tried booting up without the video card installed</li>
<li>I've tried disconnecting the HDDs</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a TON of Google search results for ""PC is turning on/off"", but they all cover the same two scenarios, 1) the PC is a new build and it's power cycling after booting up for the first time, or 2) The PC is suddenly power cycling after working fine for a long time. I've tried most of the suggestions in those post, except for swapping out the PSU or motherboard, which I'll attempt next, but in the meantime, I was hoping that my specific scenario of having the PC turned off for a year, then having it up boot up successfully and turning it off after letting run for a few hours, THEN experience the power cycling, might lend some additional insight that could help me narrow down the problem further.

<p>As explained in that question, I want the cursor in Emacs just stay at the location in the text while I scroll (so it becomes invisible if I scroll more than one window height below or above).</p>

<p>I've got an impression from that question that Emacs fans hate this idea, so let me explain that I really, really need it. Here is why: I am running <a href=""https://www.gap-system.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GAP</a> in Emacs. While it is computing something, occasionally I want to return back to contemplate what has been already computed. The cursor follows me, and if at that moment GAP produces output, it will go where the cursor currently is, producing big mess sometimes.</p>

<p>It means that I do not necessarily want to make cursor stay where it was. It would be also OK to force GAP placing output where the cursor was before Emacs moved it away. But I suspect that would be much more difficult to do. If not, please tell me how to do it.</p>

<p>The first one it's about buying a new AC adapter for my Dell laptop the specs for the original one and the one i've found are this</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL -></strong> INPUT: 100-240V <strong>1.6A</strong> 50-60Hz / OUTPUT: 19.5V 3.34A / 65w / PA-12 FAMILY - MODEL: LA65NS2-01</p>

<p><strong>NEW -></strong> INPUT: 100-240V <strong>1.5A</strong> 50-60Hz / OUTPUT: 19.5V 3.34A / 65W / PA-12 FAMILY - MODEL: LA65NS1-00</p>

<p>As you might notice, everything is the same except for the input amperage, my question is there is a problem with that, this will harm my laptop in some way? or the only specs that really matter are the output ones?</p>

<p>The second problem I have is since my laptop is from Dell, in some webpages people says that almost every non OEM accesories, like AC adapters, batteries, etc. doesn't work, for example, if I connect a new AC adapter and it is not from Dell this will work but will no charge my battery at all, and for what I have been reading, AC adapter come with something than allows the computer recognize that it's not OEM, and this is probably what will happen... The question is, there is some way that I can bypass this restiction? maybe BIOS configuation or something?</p>

<p>By the way my laptop it's a Dell Inspiron 14' series 5000 model 5447</p>

"1160054","Windows 8.1 Pro Input Language settings corrupted?","<p>I just installed genuine Windows 8.1 Pro on top of my previous Windows 8.1 Pro N. This is a Windows installation upgrade option, which keeps everything unchanged and puts the old files inside the Windows folder in a Windows.old folder in the same (root) directory. </p>

<p>I also created a new admin account to replace my old one in Windows. Almost everything works fine after this transition, except a few settings that i have now fixed and my language input settings.. I fear they have become corrupt. On my former account, which i can still use, i have 2 language options set that you can see below : </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MFmdu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MFmdu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now on my new windows account i have the same language setup. English US as the default option and Greek as the secondary language. You can also see the advanced language settings i have set here : </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/2sd28.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/2sd28.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Whenever i log into my new account with all these settings, i can only type in greek (i can't left alt-shift to english-us). This is clearly a bug or something, since my primary language and keyboard layout is english us. I want the option to be able to left alt + shift to change the input language. The only way i fix this is by going to Control Panel -> Language and remove greek language. Then SUPER KEY + L to logout and back in. Then i add the greek language again. Now both languages work, but obviously i cannot do that each and every time i start the system. And as i said before all this works perfectly on my old account. </p>

<p>As you can see my problem is severe. If i can't write properly on the computer i can't use it.. Is it possible that the language settings have been corrupted? What can i do to fix this? I was thinking that i can somehow export all language settings (maybe the language registry entries?) from my old account and then import them to my new account. But i don't know how to do that. If someone could help i would be very grateful. Thanks in advance.</p>

What else may HP have done to limit the maximum supported RAM of this laptop to only 16GB? Both the RAM slots are available, so I can easily replace both units with single 16GB SO-DIMMs.</p>

<p>I haven't got two 16GB SO-DIMMs available to try, has anyone else tried?</p>

<p>Is there also a test / tool i can run at the end of the processes after the new OS and drivers have been installed, to check nothing is missing ? </p>

But if you join the computers to the domain you have to deal with a lot more work because you have to make sure the pc's are taken care of too.  </p>

<p>What am I missing here?  Why do organizations add pc's to the domain vs just making them rdp from their pc to the server?  </p>

<p>I've just had a sudden realization... I'm old enough to remember <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input%E2%80%93output"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PIO</a>; you know... where the CPU was involved in transferring pretty much every byte from an attached peripheral (harddisk, CD-rom, network adapter etc.) to memory. Which could be a very CPU intensive task at times. So then came along <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DMA</a> which, essentially, just told a device: ""here's a slice of memory for you, go put your stuff there and tell me when you're done"". My realization came when I noticed the bitlocker icon on my drives... Whatever OS your computer (or NAS or phone or...) uses: your CPU is responsible for doing the encryption, right? Though we (usually) have multiple cores nowadays and specialized AES instructions in our CPU's and so on, all which might alleviate the load... aren't we basically back to, what essentially is, PIO?</p>

<p>We could still use DMA to put entire blocks of data into memory and back to the storage device again and won't have to stall the CPU during that operation but we still need our CPU to process each and every byte (en/decrypting it) before we can use it. It maybe very fast, negligible even. If, however, there was a dedicated circuit between the device and DMA that could handle doing the en/decryption that would free our CPU of that burden. Is there such a circuit in modern systems? Is it maybe in the Northbridge/Southbridge/ICH/FCH/whatchamacallit? I can imagine RAID controllers or other dedicated I/O controllers (maybe just the more expensive ones?) have dedicated circuitry but what about a 'common consumer computer'?</p>

<p>Though I also realise Bitlocker is maybe more of an OS-level construct I guess. But I'm not specifically interested in bitlocker; I'm curious about any means of volume, partition or blocklevel encryption.</p>

"1548351","What is the legitimate reason to have ""disable remote input"" available at all on TeamViewer?","<p>I've been watching some (Jim Browning) videos where the video shows the scammer's perspective of a scam, and regularly the scammers use the ""Disable remote input"" and ""Show black screen"" options on TeamViewer. Using that, they can do some nasty stuff on the victim's computer, and optionally have the victim watch as all of their files get deleted, for example.</p>

<p>So that made me wonder: what is the actual legitimate use case where disabling remote input is actually necessary? I'd assume the intended purpose is when someone is helping out a relative (or customer for that matter), and then they keep moving their mouse, which can be annoying. I can imagine that was the use case this was invented for. But if that is the only type of use case, I can't imagine anyone in their right mind would consider that enough reason to build that into the product.</p>

<p>I've made some software myself where the power given to users via that software could perhaps do more harm than good (in my case: automated editing software for Wikipedia), and one of my first considerations for new features is always: Can this do more harm than good? Will this be used by malicious users for vandalism? Because of that, I really can't imagine ""disable remote input"" being implemented and anyone answering ""no"" to similar questions as mine for TeamViewer's case.</p>

<p>TeamViewer in itself, without being able to prevent the <em>computer's owner</em> from interacting with <em>their own machine</em>, is already powerful enough, because it can allow people with malicious intent to do some really nasty stuff to people's computers, for example pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>del</kbd> and <kbd>enter</kbd> in quick succession. Because of that, my question is this: does anyone know what the intended use case for these features is? Because so far, I'm getting convinced by those videos that TeamViewer is worse than a virus, in some cases.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I know this is a relatively subjective question, but it does still seem to meet most of the criteria listed at the bottom of <a href=""https://superuser.com/help/dont-ask"">this page</a>, I believe.</p>

"1382764","Full screen apps (games) cause screen to turn on and off, but only if computer ran overnight","<p>The problem:<br>
Running any game in full screen causes the screen to turn on and off. It goes completely black for 1-2 seconds, then turns back on. This will keep happening at uneven intervals. Sometimes it will stay on for a minute or two, sometimes it will stay on for just a few seconds. Everything else continues to work while it's off - sound work, mouse and keyboard input works, etc. While the screen is on there are no visible issues - fps is steady, no video artifacts, etc. </p>

<p>The weird part:<br>
This only happens if I leave the computer running overnight. A restart fixes it every time and I've never experienced the issue within the same day that I've restarted or turned it on. There are also no issues with anything that's not full screen, exiting the game stops the behavior. It also doesn't happen if playing in windowed mode.</p>

<p>I've checked the event log and I don't see anything being logged when this happens. This is a desktop running windows 10 with a GeForce GTX 1070 in it that's connected via display port to a single monitor.

"1251039","Finding How a Virus Keeps Reinstalling?","<p>I recently got infected with a ton of viruses, and I was able to clean out most of them, but there's still one that I can't get rid of. Here are the details (the computer is running Windows 10 x64):</p>

<p>-The effect of the virus is rather miniscule; whenever I search using the top bar on Google Chrome, it redirects my searches to Yahoo although I have my settings set to Google.</p>

<p>-The name of the program is msmnlbvsrv.exe. It appears in my Windows/temp folder, which is the temporary files folder specified by my environment variables.</p>

<p>-The exe itself can't be deleted from Windows because of some permissions shenanigans that I haven't been able to get around; basically even if I change the owner, it denies me access to delete it. In fact, you can't actually stop the process from the regular task manager either because it once again denies you access. But I was able to kill it by using Process Explorer as an admin.</p>

<p>But the real problem is this: I booted Gparted Live to delete it from there in an attempt to remove it, but when I restart my computer, it's back in my temp folder. This means that some other application is the actual culprit and is running at boot and creating this program that redirects my searches. How can I figure out what exactly is creating the process and remove it from the source? Neither Windows Defender nor Malwarebytes could get rid of the source itself, and I really, REALLY don't want to have to reinstall my OS. Also, I've seen Process Monitor mentioned here and there, but it doesn't run on my computer no matter what I do. No window opens, and if I look at process explorer, the process appears and disappears within the same second.</p>

"1162967","Why not always Quad-pump?","<p>So, with a rudimentary understanding of data transfer, typically bits are transmitted once per full clock cycle, on the rising edge of the clock's wave. Double-pumping instead transmits twice per cycle, on both the rising and falling edge of the clock's wave. Quad-pumping goes further, by transmitting on both clock edges, and also at the peaks between them (if my understanding is wrong, please correct!).</p>

<p>Is there a reason that we can't always quad-pump? Is there such thing as octo-pumping, and if not, what's stopping us? What is the limiting factor? I figured these questions would all have similar answers so I folded them into just one submission, hopefully that's ok.</p>

"1549539","Custom 3.5mm front audio jacks? Win10, 9-pin MB audio connector","<p>Not sure if this is the right forum; if not, please feel free to gently redirect me to a more appropriate place to ask this question.</p>

<p>I'm not an audiophile, this would mostly be for conference call audio on my personal desktop PC (Win10). I <em>do</em> need 'hotswapping', where if I plug in headphones, any other speakers or microphones on the system are disabled (and when the headphones are unplugged, it goes back to the previous input/output). I think my MB does this automatically with the rear panel audio ports, but those are not easily accessible (large heavy PC case, jammed behind a desk).</p>

<p>I looked at aftermarket PC front bays with audio ports, but don't have an open bay so I'm avoiding this option. I thought I could just buy a few jacks and install them directly on the front of my case and wire them to the MB 9-pin audio connector (not afraid of a soldering iron). Then I started Googling, and got lost. </p>

<p>I previously thought that the ability to sense presence of a plug (and hot-switch outputs) was based on resistance in the actual audio/ground loop, but instead maybe that requires switched jacks? I got lost on what type of jack I'd need (how many switches, if any). So, I'm posting here for feedback before buying parts - to see if this project even makes sense, and if so, what I need to look for in the jack specs.</p>

<p>I'd want to be able to use either my regular cell phone headset (integrated mic, one plug, 4 connectors, 3.5mm) or one of my other (better?) PC headsets that actually split the audio and mic into two different 3.5mm plugs, which is why I've added a splitter below. </p>

<ol>
<li>MB has a 9 pin audio connector (MSI x99A SLI Plus)</li>
<li>Buy a 9-pin audio extender cable that will reach the front of my case (40cm)</li>
<li>Buy a 9-pin splitter cable (10cm)</li>
<li>Connect one side to a 3.5mm 4-conductor jack (TRRS?) </li>
<li>Connect the other side to two separate 3.5mm 3-conductor jacks (2x TRS? one mic, one audio) </li>
<li>drill three holes and install the three 3.5mm jacks into the case front, and label them</li>
</ol>

<p>So, the key questions are (a) how likely am I to end up with hot-swap issues if I'm feeding off the MB 9-pin connector, (b) if this seems workable, what specs should I be looking for when buying the jacks, and (c) if this /does/ involve switched jacks, is connecting up 3 different jacks going to get so complicated that an average Joe is going to screw it up somehow? </p>

<p>This all assumes that the MB Drivers will play nice with anything connected to the 9-pin MB port...</p>

<p>Now what I want to do is finding all the first type files and move all of them to a destination folder; I looked to several answers on superuser and I manage to do the following:</p>

<p>first I used the find command to find the files this way:</p>

<pre><code>find ~/sourcedir -name ""*([0-9]).*"" -o -name ""*([0-9][0-9]).*""
</code></pre>

<p>which retrieve all the files I want (I printed them on a file and got more than 73,000 files); then I tried to pass them to the Move command this way:</p>

<pre><code>find ~/sourcedir -name ""*([0-9]).*"" -o -name ""*([0-9][0-9]).*"" -type f -exec mv {} ~/destinationdir \;
</code></pre>

<p>however doing that, just one file is moved to destination (the last one in the list) or none ; what's wrong here? why can't I move all the files in destination dir ?</p>

<p>yet, if I use only one option in the find command, say:</p>

<pre><code>find ~/sourcedir -name ""*([0-9]).*"" 
</code></pre>

<p>and then do the -execmv it works, but not if use both options; </p>

<p>indeed it looks like it's processing just the second option (as the only moved file is the one which match the second option); how can I pass all the files matching either the first or the second option to 'move'?</p>

"1252285","Running a linux fileserver *as* a VM versus *in* a VM","<p>This is ultimately a question about how to optimize a physical->virtual machine move. I've found a number of posts that are somewhat related, but nothing (yet?) that appears to address it directly. Feel free to point and blame if I didn't search well enough... ;-)</p>

<p>My physical hardware consists of a half-dozen 2TB storage drives, an 8-core/32GB supermicro Xeon board, and a couple of reasonably fast SATA SSDs.</p>

<p>At the moment I have one physical machine that acts as a dedicated file server, running Ubuntu and ext4 over MDADM in raid5 mode. This is really the only ""important"" machine in my setup, as it's my local home backup and also serves as sort of a compute server for transcoding videos and other stuff like that. I also have a couple other small linux machines that I use for random, mostly unimportant stuff - I rebuild these often and if they break I don't really care as the important data is on the file server. I also have two older windows machines that I'd love to virtualize partially to save space/power but as much to get them access to much higher performance hardware.</p>

<p>I'd like to move the file server over to a more recent linux distro and also move the bulk of the storage over to a ZFS based filesystem. I'm familiar with ESXi from a work environment, but there I don't manage the storage so that part is a little opaque to me. I'm trying to figure out how to handle the storage on this setup. I can see at least these options:</p>

<ul>
<li>run linux on the baremetal. Set up that machine as the fileserver, with ZFS set up across the physical disks just as it would be on any other machine. Then run KVM on that machine, and host VMs from there.</li>
<li><p>run linux on the baremetal, run KVM there and use this instance as basically just the hypervisor. From there build a VM that runs the fileserver and other VMs for all the other machines. In this case, I need some help figuring out how I'd expose the storage to the ZFS/file server VM. Do I just pass through all of these disks to the ZFS server? This would preclude any other VM from using this space, or they'd have to bounce back and forth a couple of times if they were hosted elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>run ESXi on the baremetal, and launch one VM to be the file server and others for the other VMs. Here, mostly the same questions apply about how I'd go about exposing the storage to the file server. Is the performance likely to be better on ESXi vs. KVM? What about expanding the storage at some future time?
I'm sure there's other stuff I'm not considering... but what is that other stuff?</p></li>

"1164031","How are ICANN's IP address reservations enforced?","<p>I've read that ICANN is the authority dedicated to assigning IP addresses to individual entities, so that no two separate entities are using the same IP address on the internet. It is my understanding that when assigning an IP address, an autonomous system number is also given to the entity. These autonomous system numbers are used by routers in some way to advertise that they have a route to an IP address.</p>

<p>My question is, how does a router know that a route and autonomous system number that they receive from a BGP peer is authentic? Is there a certificate chain of some kind used to prove that the route does indeed go to the entity that ICANN did assign the IP address to? Since an IP address can be multi homed with two or more routes to it, just because there are two routes known by a router doesn't mean that one of them is not real.</p>

<p>Does ICANN regularly publish a list of autonomous system numbers that routers cache?</p>

<p>Can routers choose to ignore ICANN's assignment of IP addresses, in the event that ICANN goes rogue? What's stopping an alt_ICANN from being created and the internet choosing to trust it instead?</p>

<p>They both have NVME drives, so that shouldn't be the bottleneck. I don't think there'd be a Mac vs Linux OS issue either, since Mac is linux based.</p>

<p>Ideally I'm looking for an application that when launched, would display a mini-desktop on all displays, showing a preview of all of the windows.  You could then simply click and drag the windows around between the displays and the actual windows would move ..  close the mini-desktop on any display in order to close it on all displays...</p>

<p>Of course - any other utility that can do what is needed would be welcome too I guess.

Then I realized that when I had put the videos into ""My Videos"", they magically got put into OneDrive as well.  Deleting them from OneDrive deleted them from ""My Videos"" as well.  Restoring them in the Recycle Bin put them back into both places.</p>

<p>Right-clicking OneDrive, it appeared that this shouldn't have happened, since</p>

<ul>
<li><p>under Settings, ""Let me use OneDrive to fetch any of my files on this PC"" was <strong>not</strong> checked;</p></li>
<li><p>under Auto Save, ""Automatically save photos and videos to OneDrive whenever I connect a camera, phone, or other devices to my PC"" was <strong>not</strong> checked either.</p></li>

"1253618","Windows 10 RAM usage not accounted for","<p>Whilst I've seem some similar questions, I can't troubleshoot the problem I am having as they tend to be specific to that user asking.</p>

<p>When I run my PC > 24 hours (I have reasons why I do this), my RAM usage creeps up. I had my PC on all weekend, and my ram was maxed out at 100%.</p>

<p>When I check in task manager, the usage is not accounted for at all.
I have 32GB RAM, and usually the highest usage on the RAM will be a Google Chrome process with half a gig usage, a handful of processes over 100MB total, then others with smaller amounts. Never enough to account for the actual usage.</p>

<p>After looking through other answers I downloaded Process Explorer, and looked at the Working Set column. There is a process there called ""memory Compression"", with 6,344K private byes but a working set of 2,6922,748K. Thats at time of writing, where my PC hasn't been on as long as I noramlly would let it run in total before a reboot. Total RAM usage currently sits at 50%.</p>

<p>Some people suggested it might be a driver with a memory leak, but I am unsure how to diagnose a problem further here. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/YRwiT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/YRwiT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
Theres an image of some of what I'm seeing. In 1-3 days, I would expect to see that at 32 GB, but with seemingly no extra processes using RAM etc.</p>

<p>When I switch on the wall button of the machine (in which the power cable of my CPU is plugged in), I can see that the motherboard is powered up because the LED on my external hard drive which is connected to one of the onboard USB ports comes on instantly.</p>

<p>However, when I press the Power On button on the CPU, there is no response. No fans, no LEDs, <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Now comes the puzzling part.</strong> </p>

<p>If I press the Power On button on CPU for more than 5 seconds my machine remains dead for a couple of minutes and then <em>voila</em>!, it powers on!!!. Some times, the PC powers on instantly and some times it takes about a minute or two. </p>

<p>Can somebody please explain why such a simple task as powering of my PC is giving me such erratic results?</p>

<p>As of right now I got the Intel Core 2 Quad <strong>Q6600</strong> 2.4GHz and it seems most contemporary mainboards aren't compatible with it?</p>

<p>I'm not an avid gamer but I like to play a game once in a while for which my CPU really <em>is sufficient</em> (Crysis 3 is playable) - gaming is not a really my point of interest here though. Instead I'm trying to optimize my PC for <strong>fast multi-tab browsing</strong>.</p>

<p>I find my PC pretty slow for browsing (I have many tabs open in my session and often open up many new ones at the same time). However, when I check the task manager my <strong>CPU load is usually never at 100%</strong> (from time to time it's at 50% without a game on). And now I'm not sure if there would be significant benefits of upgrading my CPU?<br>
Maybe there are other features in newer CPUs (caching etc) that would help improve performance? Or maybe the way the load-allocation to the cores works requires an even better CPU despite the load not being at 100%?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do think that I a new CPU would be of use I'd also be interested in any recommendations on what things to look for to improve browsing performance or specific recommendations.</li>
<li>And if you think that it wouldn't be a significant enough improvement do you know which good UEFI mainboards are compatible with my CPU? How to find out which are?</li>

<p>I am using an Ubiquiti Firewall/router and it's currently setup for IPv4 with NAT (I want to keep that). I'm looking to setup IPV6 but I have a lot of questions. I've played with IPv6 tunnels a few years back it it seemed to work well. But I'm no longer using it. Now I want to get the IPV6 from my ISP (/60), split it at the FW/router (/64, Int 1 and Int 2) and have a separate server run the DHCP/DNS (dnsmasq, for local DNS). I'm not exactly sure where to start. I think I have a config for my FW/router (still checking it) but I'm uncertain how to get the network assignment to the DHCP server. I'm running dnsmasq on a Linux sever (but I can switch to some other software). I'm not as concerned with how to configure the DHCP/DNS as I am about what technologies (RFCs) I should understand. Does anyone have any pointers?</p>

<p>PS: My network is actually more complicated with redundant services but I'll simplify to just the FW/router, the one network and dnsmasq.</p>

"1553207","Why Has The Amount of Installed RAM in PCs Stagnated?","<p>Growing up in the late '90s I recall how the typical amount of RAM installed in Windows PCs increased each year. In 1996, 8 MB or 16 MB was typical; in 1997, many PCs came with 32 MB; in 1999, we'd reached 64 MB; in 2001, 256 MB was fairly normal; and by 2005 I wasn't surprised to see 1 GB RAM in PCs.</p>

<p>It seems that for the last decade or so there hasn't been much change in the amount of RAM installed. I saw Windows Vista PCs in 2007 with 2 GB RAM; in 2020 I rarely see anything with more than 8 GB, and 4 GB is still common on cheaper machines.</p>

<p>Why hasn't the ""onward march"" of RAM size continued as it did 20 years ago? It seems slightly ironic that after making so much fanfare about 64-bit computing, many devices are still using only the same amount of RAM that is addressable by a 32-bit PC.</p>

<p>Why is this so? Why am I not seeing machines in my local computer stores with, say, 128 gigabytes of RAM on sale? Cost? maybe, but in 2000 a mere 1 gig of RAM was also expensive at the time, but not any more. Any ideas?</p>

I understand that the stack goes down one line at a time and either stores the data in the Accumulator or sends an instruction to the IR. </p>

<p>My question is: does every process have its own memory stack or does each processor have one gigantic memory stack that continually switches between different processes (and is occasionally interrupted by I/O calls)?

<p>I formatted a pendrive in macOS using disk utility (GUID, macOS extended journaled). Then I copied macOS setup for hackintosh. Then I used clover(software to make macOS pendrive bootable) to mount the efi partition. It created a 200MB efi partition. Later I needed to format the drive to use it. On windows, disk management doesn't show the option to delete the efi partition. It shows option to delete the larger partition but even after clicking delete nothing happens. I read many articles on internet. I used diskpart as administrator and selected my disk and used <code>clean</code> command. It showed disk cleaned successfully but it lied. The disk is the same. With efi partition and the data on the main partition also there. I first tried macOS disk utility to erase the disk but it says failed to erase the disk. Under details, it says partition not unmounted. I booted into my linux, used terminal <code>df</code> to list disks. Then unmounted the pendrive using <code>umount</code>.
Then formatted using <code>mkfs</code>. All commands are sudo. Terminal showed cleaning disk, creating partition table etc. After it was over, I see again that the disk is unaffected. It's new pendrive. Worked fine. No problems with pendrive whatsoever. </p>

<p>I also tried third party softwares but they all do what diskpart in Windows and terminal in Linux did which is => showed formatting completed but actually nothing happened to the pendrive. Please help me format it. </p>

"1389764","ssh local port forwarding not working","<p><strong>My goal:</strong> </p>

<p>I have a computer in a location A, let's call it host-A.
I have a computer in a location B (host-B) running an ssh server, and I can ssh from host-A into host-B. I want to access a website on the web browser of host-A, say <a href=""http://example.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://example.com/</a> via an ssh tunnel through host-B.</p>

<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>

<p>In host-A, I type <code>ssh -v -N -L 8080:example.com:80 host-B</code>.
I can check using <code>netstat  --inet -lnp</code> that ssh is indeed listening on 127.0.0.1:8080, with foreign address 0.0.0.0:*.
In host-B, I can access example.com.
Hence in host-A browser (firefox here), when I type the url ""<a href=""http://localhost:8080/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/</a>"", I should access the example.com webpage.</p>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<p>When I do this, I actually get a 404 not found. Yet, in the shell in which I issued the ""ssh -L"", I see some logs, for instance:</p>

<p><code>debug1: Connection to port 8080 forwarding to example.com port 80 requested.</code></p>

<p>(1) So what happened here? I did exactly the same (except using example.com) as, e.g., <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this example on local port forwarding</a>.</p>

<p>When I try with ""www.ubuntuforums.org"" (so <code>ssh -v -N -L 8080:www.ubuntuforums.org:80 host-B</code> in host-A), <a href=""http://localhost:8080/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/</a> actually takes me to ""<a href=""https://www.canonical.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.canonical.com/</a>"". (2) Why is that?</p>

<p>When I try with <code>ssh -v -N -L 8080:www.stackoverflow.com:80 host-B</code>, I get:</p>

I have an HM-10 BLE module device wired to my Arduino. I use it to send and receive messages from my iPhone. My Arduino runs the SoftwareSerial example sketch:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;

SoftwareSerial mySerial(10, 11); // RX, TX

void setup() {
  // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }


  Serial.println(""Goodnight moon!"");

  // set the data rate for the SoftwareSerial port
  mySerial.begin(9600);
  mySerial.println(""Hello, world?"");
}

void loop() { // run over and over
  if (mySerial.available()) {
    Serial.write(mySerial.read());
  }
  if (Serial.available()) {
    mySerial.write(Serial.read());
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like this, everything works fine: The Arduino sends messages to my iPhone as expected and prints ""ping"" on the serial monitor when I send ""ping"" to the Arduino.
However if I add these lines in </p>

<pre><code>void loop(){
 if (mySerial.available()) {
 Serial.write(mySerial.read);
 String message = String(mySerial.readString);
  if (message == ""ping"") {
  mySerial.write(""pong"");
  }
 }
} // the other code stays the same
</code></pre>

<p>it suddenly only says ""p"" on the serial monitor even though I sent ""ping"". The if statement won't be triggered either, so it won't send ""pong"" back.</p>

<p>I can't find any flaws in my code, it even worked yesterday with this exact same code.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to ask that which Linux operating system is best compatible with my current OS? Previously, I dual booted Ubuntu 14.04.5 alongside Windows 8.1 and it didn't go well. I was facing mounting issues and wifi problem on my system. I heard that this Ubuntu version is not much compatible with Windows 8 and later version. Is this true?  </p>

<p>Secondly, I uninstalled the Ubuntu from my system but didn't do boot repair. So now whenever I start my system, I get a grub window leading me to choices of OS. So is this okay if I again dual boot a linux OS without boot repairing (as I am facing some issues with boot repairing)?    </p>

When I open this PDF in Acrobat Reader and click on one of the TOC entries Acrobat jumps to the corressponding page. Now I want to add some layouts I created with ArcMap to my document. Since importing EMF or SVG exported from ArcMap isn't working very well in Writer I decided to export the layouts as PDF and use a third party tool to merge the PDFs. I already tried PDFtk and PDFsam. PDFsam creates a nice looking PDF which also isn't bigger in filesize as the summed up filesizes of the separate documents (PDFtk output also looks nice but filesize is out of scale). The downside of both tools is, that the PDFs TOC isn't working for pages after the first inserted layout. I also tried inserting place holder pages in the Writer document and exchanging them with the desired layout in PDFsam but this didn't change anything.</p>

<p>Booting my system requires unlocking the drive (OPAL SED w/PBA), then restarting. If the computer (more specifically the drive) loses power during the restart, the drive is locked again, meaning I have to enter the password again. I get stuck on this loop at least four times these days. Eventually, it always works, but I fear it's getting worse.</p>

<p>All of the hardware is 6-7 years old, but high end. I've never once noticed the platinum power supply turning on its fan, and I've never smelled anything like a burnt capacitor out of it. With how reliably everything else works, I can't imagine there being a serious motherboard fault either.</p>

<p>Perhaps a year ago, I did a thorough cleaning, wiping down non-electronic surfaces and using compressed air in some places. I hadn't used the system much since - I'm a remote worker preferring to use my laptop. The COVID-19 situation has left me at home constantly, so I found myself wanting to use the more powerful desktop, meaning I really started to notice the problem.</p>

<p>One theory so far: something is worn out, or damaged by icy compressed air, and some electronic junction needs to get hot in order to carry current reliably. The multiple restarts may be leaving time for it to warm up. This sounds far fetched, but it's all I've got.</p>

In this case it is a Dell Precision 7510 with an Intel i7 and an SSD Lite On CX2 NVMe 512 GB. The SSD failed pretty quickly and Dell sent someone to replace it. I think he also replaced the Motherboard. Unfortunately trying to boot our Win 7 Pro image failed because this machine has only USB 3, and the standard Win 7 image has no drivers for USB 3. So the guy left before we got to installing Windows, which I now regret. I added USB 3 drivers to the image and got as far into the install as selecting a drive but no drive is found –and it invites me to load a driver for mass storage.</p>

<p>But I cannot find a driver for any Lite On SSD. I’ve never seen an SSD that needed one to be added, actually so not sure if this is the right way to tackle this. I have seen suggestions of using another make of driver and I downloaded a load of different ones including Intel on the theory that’s the chipset. In BIOS I get option for AHCI and RAID On and I tried both with same result.  It recognizes different drivers if I check ‘Hide drivers that are not compatible’, depending on RAID or AHCI. But any I can see and load still give no drive visible. DISKPART also fails to find the disk so none of the solutions which involve DISKPART are useful right now.</p>

<p>If it’s relevant when I go to boot options I get: Boot mode – Legacy, Secure boot: Off.
Then under legacy boot it shows: M.2 PCIe SSD or Onboard NIC. Under UEFI Boot is : UEFI: CX2-8B512-Q11 NVMe LITEON 512GB. So it’s sort of showing up under Legacy Boot but sort of not properly. Can’t see anything else under BIOS that seems even vaguely relevant. </p>

<p>When I contacted Dell the guy said try installing Windows 10, which works fine, so he said there is no fault and it was therefore not their problem (even though it was definitely ordered as a Windows 7 machine). They also said supplying a Win 7 image was not their problem – although I tried 3 different ones, in case. Any smart people out there got a clue what to do? </p>

<p>I will just add that I know I can look up every single GUI action's Powershell equivalent on Google but this is very time consuming and I was hoping to find a better way (ideally an online resource like TechNet Library but easier/faster to search and up-to-date).</p>

<hr>

<p>I would like to know where I could find good resources/documentation on configuring a new Windows10 installation using Powershell scripts. I know bash but I'm completely new to Powershell.</p>

<p>When I search google, all I can find about automatically configuring Windows relates to Windows Deployment Services. But I don't have and don't want a Windows Server and simply running a few scripts after each installation is sufficient for me.</p>

<p>I found a few scripts that solve some of the things I want to do:</p>

<p>github => FlatlanderWoman/winCleaner</p>

<p>github => hahndorf/Set-Privacy</p>

<p>But for everything else, when I look into the TechNet Library I find it very hard to find anything useful. And when I do find something, it looks outdated:
<a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852115.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852115.aspx</a></p>

<p>The problem is: <strong>I known the GUI-way of configuring everything I want, but I don't know how to find the corresponding commandlets to do the same with Powershell.</strong></p>

<p>Is there some kind of event listener I could use to find the Cmdlets? Or does anyone have some resources/documentation to recommend? Is the TechNet Library really the established way to find these commands?</p>

"1170674","Windows 7/8/10 - Copy & Replace only when there is a difference","<p>Windows 7 and above have a somewhat ""smarter"" copy method than predecessors when duplicate filenames have been used. The dialog box will ask if you want to (using Windows 7 as the example) ""Move(or Copy) and Replace"", ""Don't Move(or Copy)"", or ""Move(or Copy), but keep both files"". This is nice, and great for single files, or sets of files with only a couple identical names. It also has an option to ""Do this for the next XXX conflicts"" - which is also great if you want to do the same thing with every file conflict if there are many.</p>

<p>Now, I'm consolidating large numbers of large files created by a dozen or so other users across multiple drives. They have also been shared between them. So, sometimes the identically named files are identical, and sometimes they're not.</p>

<p>Another ""smart"" thing built into the file copy is that it can tell me if either of the two files are ""larger"" or ""newer"" than the other. So, currently, I can base my decision - file by file, on which option to choose. However, when copying thousands of files, this becomes very tedious and time consuming.</p>

<p>Is there a way - either with a 3rd party software, or with a command-line or batch file, to have just a little bit more logic to the process? For example, I would like to always ""Move and Replace"" if the timestamp and size are identical and ""Move, but keep both files"" if there is any difference in either the timestamp or the size.</p>

<p>It will be a social network where users can post messages, reply to and like messages of the people they follow, communicate with each other, etc. The web platform will be a place to do the same, but with a few more options we can't implement in the mobile app.</p>

<p>The development of our mobile application is nearly finished and we have been running this entirely on Firebase to devote our time to front-end development. Currently, we are looking into creating our own backend with Node.js and MySQL, but we will probably add MongoDB in the near future as well (for example, to handle our chat database).</p>

<p>Now we are developing the REST API to support the backend on a local machine, nothing too fancy. We are now however also looking on what we will need to run this on. A couple of options we came across are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A regular VPS</li>
<li>Cloud Hosting services like Amazon, Firebase, ...</li>
<li>Special backend services like back4app</li>
<li>Hosting solutions like DigitalOcean</li>
</ul>

<p>I am merely wondering what would be the best solution to go with as we plan to deploy and then scale - so adding extra resources to satisfy the needs at a certain point in time is an absolute priority.</p>

<p>Currently, the choice for DigitalOcean seems perfect, all of their products &amp; prices can be found <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on their website</a>. So basically what I would like to know is 1. any downsides to using a product/solution like DigitalOcean and 2. what we would need to start (e.g. we are now running on Firebase - what kind of server, what memory, what CPU capacity should we consider to serve at least what we can save with the <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blaze plan of Firebase</a>?</p>

<p>I hope this is the right place to ask a question like this. Thank you for any help! </p>

I won't go into the specific details, as I have asked a question about it on Unix &amp; Linux SE <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/494457/257802"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The behavior during boot seems rather inconsistent. Sometimes the display blacks out early in the boot process; sometimes it gets to the graphical login window and then blacks out when I log in.</p>

<p>So, what I'm wondering is: in general, does inconsistent behavior of a computer always indicate a hardware issue? My thinking is that seems logical, because code should be static, unless the filesystem is progressively becoming corrupted (which would point to a failure of the hard disk in any case). So, any inconsistent behavior must then point to an underlying hardware issue.</p>

<p>I have a great amount of resources, but I can't seem to find a setup that fits. I have looked into SoftEther but it seems like it is just out of my needs.</p>

<p>My need is to create a Mesh VPN server on my home server (which has a public IP) and manually connect to it (in much the same way as Hamachi) so that my peers can interact with my home computer as a central server.

"1394918","Efficiently mix encryption and rsync on an external drive?","<p>I have an external hard drive that contains several folders. The largest of these folders is a backup that I often update by rsyncing the relevant folders from an encrypted (via Ubuntu's implementation of ecryptfs) internal drive and the remainder are folders that I don't have copies of anywhere else and likely do not have enough storage space to place elsewhere. <strong>What I want to do is encrypt my external drive whilst still being able to update its contents via rsync</strong>, however I seem to have ran in to the following problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>For the reasons already discussed, any method of encryption that would require me to wipe the external drive is highly undesirable. I would be willing to buy another drive, but that would cause issues mentioned in point #3.</li>
<li>A method based on a system like ecryptfs would be undesirable because, to the best of my knowledge, the backup would be made inaccessible if the internal drive's user account becomes unusable (e.g. if the internal drive dies, which is half of the reason why I'd want to have the backup in the first place!).</li>
<li>Even if I could get one of these methods to work, I do not believe that they would be compatible with rsync. I often don't have the opportunity to leave my machine turned on for long enough to copy my files from the internal drive to the external drive without the help of rsync. So unless I can get rsync to work with the encryption method, I would almost rather have an unencrypted drive that I could rsync.</li>

"1395297","Are there common problems between rounting and mat-dialogs in Angular?","<p>What I wanted to do was to open a mat-dialog by clicking on an icon.
This mat-dialog is a split panel that has to the left side buttons that can be clicked and to the right side a content space where other components are supposed to be loaded on click on the specific button. 
Now, I followed the guidelines of the original documentation for routing on <a href=""https://angular.io/guide/router"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://angular.io/guide/router</a> , but when I clicked the first icon to open the dialog, it's style was changed and it didn't open in form of a dialog anymore. Now I figured I could just keep the dialog style by changing the url within the method of calling the dialog like this </p>

<pre><code>dialogRef.afterOpened().subscribe(result =&gt; {
      this.router.navigate(['/dialog']);
    });
   dialogRef.afterClosed().subscribe(result =&gt; {
     this.router.navigate(['']);
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Like this the url changed with opening anf closing the dialog the way I wanted. But I've got another routing-module with another component, which is working perfectly fine, before opening the dialog,but does not work anymore afterwards.
And now the loading of the component via routing and using <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> in the html tag does not work either. 
Now, my question is if there are some general problems with mat-dialog and routing that I might solve by using a different way? Is it necassary to code a custom dialog (not using mat-dialog)? I had everything working fine before with a service, though I thought changing the url and opening the components by navigation would be a lot less code and a nicer solution.</p>

<p>Hopefully, someone can explain this problem to me and what is actually happening. I might provide more general code, but like I said I pretty much followed the official documentation.

<p>I already have an SSD which isn't sold anymore, so I'd either buy two identical ones (if required) or only one more which is roughly as big.</p>

<p>In short: What kind of problems can occur when using different disks in one ZFS volume, and how does it affect the performance of Proxmox? There's nothing on Google yet to this topic...</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong: My aspect on computer architecture and organisation is that,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In early day computers, there was a single processor on a single chip.</p></li>
<li><p>And with evaluation there were multi-chip processors, with each chip having a single processor. </p></li>
<li><p>Then in modern days there are multiprocessors. With each processor chip called a socket, this socket contained multiple processors. They are called cores.</p>

<ul>
<li>Core: An individual processing unit on a processor chip. A core may be equivalent in functionality to a CPU on a single - CPU system. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I will briefly lay my understanding on Hyper Threading Technology. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>For each physical core that is actually present in the socket, the operating system addresses two virtual (logical) cores and shares the workload whenever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>These cores have multiple levels of large memory caches . And the logical processors sharing the execution units of each of core.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now my question is what is a thread? </p>

<p>As a programmer when I create two threads and I run my program, how does the threads divide in to cores.</p>

<p>I want to know that on which logical processors that these threads run on. </p>

<p>I gave myself an answer for that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These threads must be run on two separate logical processors that belongs to two physical cores, because if we divide these threads to the two logical processors of one physical core, concurrency is not achieved. As one logical processor is run at a given time in one physical core.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>DDR3 is a single voltage capable memory SoDIMM, which supports 1.5V
operation only. It is NOT compatible with systems using 4th gen Intel
processors, which exclusively support 1.35V operation for memory.</p>

<p>In every website I have visited what it says is that DDR3 is not backward compatible with intel 4th generation processors but I am confused because my case is different, by default I have a DDR3, I don't want to add another DDR3 RAM I want to add a DDR3L RAM. Besides, my memory (I don't understand why) is configured with 1.35v.</p>

<p>The fact that it's raw isn't surprising. What's surprising to me as a novice is that (1) if I try to copy/paste that raw text into Notepad++ and save as .pdf, Acrobat can't read the file, and (2) when I download (using Chrome) the actual .pdf from the filing, which is available elsewhere on the EDGAR system, and open it up in Notepad++, the raw text looks <em>much</em> different from the XML-file raw text, even though I expect them to encode the same file. For example,</p>

<p><strong>Why can't Acrobat read the raw text from the XML .txt file? Is there a way to alter that easily so it's readable?</strong> Why does the raw text look so different when I download the actual PDF? Are they different representations of the same file, or is the published .pdf actually a much different file from what could be extracted from the .txt file? </p>

<p>I tried searching for information on ASCII and different types of Unicode, and found <a href=""https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>, but didn't see how to apply it to PDF files.

"1397894","A truly strict site blocking extension","<p>I recently installed an app named <em>AppBlock</em> in my android phone. The thing I like about the app is that it has a <strong>strict mode</strong> which once activated will not let you change the settings of the app and <em>neither will allow you to remove the app</em> till the time duration of the strict mode expires. I am sure there must be a way to bypass the strict mode, but I do not want to know.</p>

<p>But I could not find any site blocking extension for chrome which has quite the same feature. The extension <em>StayFocusd</em> has a <strong>nuclear option</strong>, similar to the strict mode of <em>AppBlock</em>, but even with the nuclear mode on it is very easy to remove the extension just by clicking on its icon and hitting <em>remove from chromium</em>.</p>

<p>So my question is: Is there a site blocking extension out there which will not allow you to remove it for the stipulated period of time? Or is there some trick that you know which achieves the desired goal?</p>

<p>I've just converted a WD Green, 2TB HDD (data only) NTFS - using Minitool Partition Wizard 9.1 from MBR to GPT. Drive was about 67% full.</p>

<p>Using Windows 10. I have a UEFI GPT boot drive. The website specifically said this does not lose data!  Using the convert mbr to gpt command only took a couple of seconds (should it have been a long process?)</p>

<p>It now shows up as Basic GPT - Unallocated - empty space. 
Also no drive letter is assigned.</p>

<p>Its not a system disk so no activity should have over written any data yet.</p>

<p>Before I try to recover the partition, does anyone have any experience - should I:</p>

<p>1 - first convert the drive BACK to MBR then try and recover the data?</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2 - Is it safer to stick with the GPT and attempt recovery from its current type?</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>3 - Assign a driveletter and reboot, maybe the system will then see the GPT?</p>

<ul>
<li>HP BIOS</li>
<li>Realtek HD Audio</li>
<li>AMD HD Graphics</li>
<li>Synaptics TouchPad</li>

<p>The first was a firmware update, but all of the others were driver updates.
I've owned a few computers and it always seems that non-BIOS devices don't need firmware updates.</p>
<p>So, first let me confirm two things.
The non-BIOS devices in my list probably do each have their own individual private firmware, right?
If needed, these firmwares could be updated by the computer itself (with no special hardware/connection changes), right?</p>
<p>Then, why do devices tend to need driver updates much more often than firmware updates?
I suppose that this is by design due to fear of bricking the device (unlike a driver update, a mistaken firmware update might mess up the communication such that it can't get another update), so the device is designed with priority for flexible device-side operation from the start.</p>

Is this a rip off?","<p>About 5 or 6 years ago I had a laptop HDD go bad on me (wouldn't boot anymore). I removed the HDD and have had it stored away since then because it has almost all of our pictures/videos of my son's very early years. It is very important to my wife and me, obviously.</p>
<p>Recently I tried to connect it to my PC using a SATA cable, but I could not get BIOS to recognize the disk exists. I can hear/feel the HDD spin, but no matter what connections I used I could not get BIOS to see it.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of the data I sent it to werecoverdata.com and paid a $95 diagnostics fee.</p>
<p>The quote I was provided was $1750, (the cheapest of the time frame options). I asked what the issues were and this is what I was told: &quot;The hard drive is unstable and has System Area issue.&quot;</p>
<p>I've done some googling and see a lot of references to programs that allegedly fix unstable sectors, which I'm assuming is what &quot;unstable&quot; means. System Area doesn't mean much to me.</p>
<p>Ultimately I need the data off of the HDD, but $1750 seems pretty steep, especially if they just run some program I can download for $50 to get the data off.</p>
<p>I could really use some other opinions, ideas, thoughts on this price.</p>

"1177487","Laptop power supply trips electrics, only at home. What causes this?","<p>So my gaming laptop is 4 years old now and ever since I got it, it has tripped the electrics in my house.</p>

<p>Now I'd like to remedy the issue once and for all. At the moment I am using an RCD (or GFI for our American friends) to be able to power the laptop up (it's battery is screwed so it requires constant power from the socket (could be related)).</p>

<p>The use of the RCD does not remedy the house electrics tripping, it merely reduces the chance of it occurring. I plug the laptop into the pre-tripped RCD and then slowly press and release the ""Reset"" button, and majority of the time this stops the house electrics tripping.</p>

<p>It's all sounding grim, I know, but now I'm looking to remedy the issue, but I don't know where the fault lies. My theories are:
- The fault is with the laptop power adapter, but the tripping only occurs at home, not at work or any relatives or friends houses I visit with my laptop.
- The fault is with the house electrics. The house is almost 100 years old, so it could be the case, but nothing else seems to trip the electrics, although the laptop is the only high powered item that is plugged and unplugged on a regular basis.
- There is no fault with either of the above but I am exceeding the maximum load of my consumer unit with everything I have powered up or plugged in in the house.</p>

<p>The house consumer unit is a fuse board, but also has a MCB rated at 240v 50Hz, 63A Load, 30mA Trip, WES 63/2. The RCD is rated 230v, 13A, A/C only, 30mA Trip.
The laptop charger is rated AC Input 100-240V 3.5A 50-60Hz with a DC Output of 19.5V, 11.8A, 230W.</p>

<p>Is there a way to find where the fault lies, if any, or to work out how to fix this from happening in the future? Maybe a test I can do on the consumer unit or laptop charger?</p>

<p>I seem to experience fewer problems when using the US Dvorak layout&mdash;though the issues don't entirely disappear, like how I just typed <strong>isss</strong> instead of <strong>issues</strong>. Moreover, my speed is ~10-15 WPM slower than my QWERTY speed pre-Dvorak according to several typing tests I've taken, though I do make fewer typos (presumably because of this overarching issue with not hitting keys hard enough). I am currently migrating back to QWERTY because I've been having trouble typing on another person's keyboard where I can't easily switch to Dvorak.</p>

<p>It's almost as if some of my fingers are frozen sometimes, limiting my fingers' mobility/actuation force. Would my fingers benefit from a mechanical keyboard with key switches like the Cherry MX Brown or Blue switches, where more force is required to depress those keys? The idea is to strengthen the troublesome fingers, but maybe I've been hitting the laptop keys too hard where I'm used to a normal desktop keyboard?</p>

"1267381","Why are secondary storage mediums divided into sectors, why is primary storage allocated in blocks of 8 bits?","<p>Secondary storage mediums are always divided into sectors, but if a file is placed on a secondary storage medium, most likely, part of the file will partially fill up a sector and another file will not be able to store itself in that partially filled up sector. Hence if secondary storage mediums are divided into sectors, then less data can be stored versus if the secondary storage medium was not divided into sectors. Then what is the philosophy of the sector system?</p>

<p>Does this philosophy carry over in terms of primary storage and how they are allocated into blocks of 8 bits?</p>

<p>So it can have return codes 0 or 2, but not 1? Why did they (apparently) skip 1?

<p>The motherboard is an MSI MSI X58 Pro-E and there are 6 slots with 3 RAM sticks installed of type Kingston DDR3-1333 PC3-10600 SDRAM. I found some Kingston ValueRAM 2 GB DDR3-1333 sticks online. Would these fit this motherboard? I'm guessing this would be fine, but I'd like to make sure before I order them.</p>

<li>There is no additional version control etc needed. Its just a flat file that is associated with each of your source code file. </li>
<li>It loads the changes in the side bar and can be edited or new notes can be added.</li>

"1568404","Home router with ""advanced"" firewall rules, only allow certain outbound IP ranges for specific devices","<p>I'm looking for a home network router that allows me to isolate certain machines from most of the internet but not all of it.  I donot want to do this based on port numbers alone but by ip range.</p>
<p>For example, a Windows 10 machine on my network (192.168.4.10) can communicate through a proxy, but also has need of accessing the internet in ways that cannot be proxied.  For this purpose, the box is allowed to connect to a specific IP range only (a.b.c.d/16 for example).  It would also be good if this can be either allow or deny based rules (some boxes only have deny rules, meaning you have to invert everything and cannot combine rules properly).</p>
<p>So I'd like to configure a rule in the router that looks like this (with <code>iptables</code>):</p>
<pre><code>iptables -N PROXY   # create proxy chain
iptables -A FORWARD --source 192.168.4.10 -j PROXY    # send traffic from isolated machine to PROXY chain
iptables -A PROXY --destination 145.x.y.z/16 -j ACCEPT   # allow some subnet only
iptables -A PROXY -j DROP  # drop everything else (enforces proxy use)
</code></pre>
<p>Or shorter (untested):</p>
<pre><code>iptables -A OUTPUT --source 192.168.4.10 --destination 145.x.y.z/16 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT --source 192.168.4.10 -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>What router brand/type might have such capabilities, or what keyword should I be looking for?  Most I've looked at only allow this kind of blocking for a specific client based on &quot;services&quot; (ie. a port range and protocol).  If they'd also have some fields for an ip mask and make the ports optional I think it would be good enough for what I'm trying to achieve.</p>

<p>But when you open Explorer for a specific folder (for instance by entering <code>C:\</code> in the start menu search box) it opens and runs just fine. And without any delay.</p>
<p>Everything is alright until you accidentally click on &quot;Quick Access&quot;, then it also freezes.</p>
<p>So it appears that it wants to show the &quot;Quick Access&quot; items by default.
Quick Access appears to be the modern variant of the recently opened files list.</p>
<p>Workaround:</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the web I learned that if you have a chance to run explorer normally, you can temporarily fix the situation.</p>
<p>If you have it running normally:</p>
<ol>
<li>right click on the top left &quot;Quick Access&quot; tree node in the navigation pane</li>
<li>choose &quot;Options&quot; from the popup menu</li>
<li>find the &quot;Privacy&quot; group box in the dialog</li>
<li>press the &quot;Clear&quot; button.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes the quick access screen forget about all the files - which possibly includes missing, broken or just very large files.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that there is a problem with this &quot;Quick Access&quot; frame, but how to debug something like this?
Tried debugging with Visual Studio but then it only shows that the project is blocking on one of the win32 wait functions.</p>

My concern is simply about <strong>sharing</strong> files between different accounts without bringing the PC into consideration - only as a form of cloud backup.</p>

<p>The closest post I have found is <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1000526/using-multiple-google-drive-accounts-to-get-around-the-15gb-limit"">this one</a>, but while it formulates my question pretty well, the answers given still revolve around syncing to a PC and the use of the Drive software, and how it can be abusive to have simultaneous Google accounts syncing at once from one PC.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: What I would like to know is whether I can own several google accounts which all share their storage Drives with one central account, and whether this is considered ""abusing"" the system. After all, shared folders only use up the storage quota of the original folder owner. Namely, any personal experiences from anyone with a similar setup would be very useful.</p>

<p>I'm not asking just out of nitpickery, I'm legitimately interested (read ""paranoid"") about a secondary form of backing up a large-ish amount of information - say around 150 GB, 10 times the quota for free accounts -
 other than physical drives (which would be my primary form of backup). </p>

<p>As for why bother having multiple Google accounts instead of just paying for upgraded storage for one account, consider the remote possibility of losing access to said account - by spreading the ownership of data among several accounts, there would be a marginally lower chance of losing everything. Plus, if all accounts share data among themselves, <strong>any</strong> particular one can access everything at once. </p>

<p>Note how this method does not require simultaneous logins, nor does it put a strain on file syncing, therefore in theory it should not be considered abusive.</p>

<p>I've recently commenced revitalizing a <em>very</em> old PC. She's running an Intel Pentium, x86_64. I thought I'd give Gentoo a go because I've found it very appealing and as a Bedrock user I wanted to be able to boot off of Gentoo's init system (initrc, we all know why) as well as bootloader. I've gotten almost halfway through the install ( maybe more like a third :))) ), and now I'm looking for the <code>stage3</code> files for my PC. I've noticed that though there are builds for <code>i486</code> and <code>i686</code>. Being genuinely interested in which my PC was, I searched it up and after some light digging found this explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>i386 works with any x86 processor (Intel, AMD,etc.),</li>
<li>i486 has some performance tun[n]ing.</li>
<li>i586 for Pentium and Pentium-MMX</li>
<li>i686 for Pentium-Pro, P2,P3, P4, etc.</li>

<p>But in that case Gentoo doesn't support my device?!? Hence, my question: what <code>i</code> version (?) is my Intel Pentium PC? And where are the <code>stage3</code> files for it? Is it possible to use, say, an <code>i486</code> for a presumed <code>i586</code>?</p>

What I'm questioning is whether I should buy the standard or pro version. I use the Acrobat SDK to automate a bunch of tasks including importing and exporting fields to and from databases, enabling and disabling fields' readonly property, and saving files as reader extended PDFs.</p>
<p>Does the standard version allow for all the same functionality as the pro version when using the SDK? I can't find the answer to this online and I don't want to purchase the standard version only to find out it doesn't provide all of the functionality that I need.</p>
<p>Another question I have is regarding the Perpetual license. I would preferably like to buy the Perpetual license as that will be the cheaper option in the long run. For the subscription license you can install the software on up to two computers. Is this the same for the Perpetual license? Or can the Perpetual license only be installed on one computer?</p>

"1272491","BYpassing anti-WiFi protocols","<p>At my university we have super fast LAN internet in the hostels, but no WiFi available. Many students have used their laptops to create Hotspots, but they face the penalty of a fine should they ever be caught. My question is whether there is a way to spoof the network/create a hotspot that cannot be discovered. </p>

<p>The IT technicians are obviously very secretive about the way their system works, but from what we can figure out is that they walk through the hostels and search for WiFi hotspots. When they find one that isn't theirs, they attempt to connect, and by doing so uncover the IP behind the network, pointing to the physical computer and port which it is connected to, and they shut it off. </p>

<p>Is this a possible way of doing so, or could they monitor the traffic on the physical port and flag a hotspot according to that? And is there any way to get around either of these scenarios? </p>

<p>Many Thanks</p>

It was saved as an MPEG file, so I downloaded a codec from the Microsoft store to play it, and still, no dice. I googled the title it provided - movie 65923 - to try and see what movie it even was, and it said that it was probably malware and I should get rid of it. However, when I go to delete it, a message comes up saying another program has opened the file, so I should close that program and try again.

<p>On the other hand, my laptop's expresscard drive uses the PCI express 1X interface, which is capable of 2.5Gbit/s. So, the 5Gbit/s USB3 port on the express-to-usb3 card would be bottlenecked to 2.5Gbit/s maximum, right?</p>

"1273058","Browser plugin enabling DANE protocol with Firefox, Chrome or other browser?","<p>Context: I'm setting up a .bit domain on the Namecoin blockchain, and I want to use TLS with it.</p>

<p>According to my understanding, DANE is a protocol whereby valid TLS keys for a domain are discovered through some newly-defined DNS queries, instead of or in addition to through CA-signed certificates.  While a CA goes through some hoops to verify that you are the owner of a domain (such as sending an email to the address in the SOA section, or asking you to add a secret TXT record), DANE directly defines valid TLS keys in the DNS server itself, so as long as you have a secure connection with the authoritative DNS server for a domain, it's just as secure as using a certificate.</p>

<p>Namecoin enables TLS on .bit domains via the DANE protocol.  Therefore, I am looking for browser add-ons for Firefox and/or Chromium (or other browsers) that will query the DNS server for DANE protocol records (TLSA, if I am not mistaken), and use those to validate TLS keys.</p>

<p>Firefox has <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dnssec-validator/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this addon</a> but A) it's not compatible with firefox 57 and B) I am not clear on whether the plugin uses DANE <em>instead of</em> checking that the cert is signed by a CA or <em>in addition to</em> doing that.</p>

<p>I went ahead and installed <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/dnssec?hl=en-US"" rel=""noreferrer"">DNSSEC Validator and TLSA Validator</a> for Chrome but they are giving me these ""The DNSSEC validating core could not be initialised"" errors that I unfortunately do not have time to google tonight.  Those extensions might work.</p>

<p>A quick google search did not reveal any other (compatible) plugins for Firefox or Chrome, so I'm just wondering if there are any I may not have seen, or if there are any that are currently being written, or if either of those two Chrome extensions has the ability to verify TLS keys through DANE instead of through CA certs.</p>

For example <code>c:\&gt;start calc</code> will launch windows calculator, but I have no idea where is located the executable <code>calc.exe</code> and how did the application make a shortcut for it (so it could be used as a argument to <code>start</code> command). Another example <code>c:\&gt;start gcc foo.c</code> will trigger the gcc compiler (installed from mingw), but how does <code>start</code> command know where to find its executable? I know the cmd.exe will look in <code>%PATH%</code>, which in my case is <code>C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\WINDOWS\System32\OpenSSH\;C:\Program Files\dotnet\;C:\Strawberry\c\bin;C:\Strawberry\perl\site\bin;C:\Strawberry\perl\bin;C:\Users\ppast\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\Users\ppast\.dotnet\tools;C:\Users\ppast\OneDrive\Plocha\scripts;</code></p>

<pre><code>'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>gives error. But I know I have the windows compiler installed (since I have visual studio c++ installed).</p>

<p>I saw the same thing when I opened port 22 on my NAS to enable SFTP. Suddenly my NAS emailed me about blocking this and that IP address that had tried to access through SSH (which also uses port 22). In this case I just changed the SFTP port to some random port up in the thousands area.</p>

"1184841","Can a mini-fridge be effectively looped into a liquid cooling solution for an OCed workstation?","<p>I just finished my basement into a beautiful new home office and will be moving everything down shortly.  I plan to have my computer to the left of my footwell in a new custom built desk, and planned my mini fridge to be in the next alcove to hold drinks for the workday.  I plan to build a new workstation shortly with a new Ryzen 1800X, and the XFR got me thinking...</p>

<p>I was already considering a liquid cooling setup as this will also act as my primary gaming PC (and I play a few cpu-bound games), as well as 3D rendering workstation.  With the fridge so close, it seems like a waste not to make use of it as part of the cooling setup if possible.</p>

<p><strong>The Setup</strong></p>

<p>I envision a pump inside of the PC case with a tube that runs out of the case, through a finned heat exchanger, into the fridge, coiled along the interior wall, back out of the fridge and then back into the case for cooling.  The external, finned, air-cooled heat exchanger would be used prior to the fridge to reduce excessive heat and limit the extra power the fridge would waste dealing with at least some of the heat.  The fridge would just be cooling near ambient coolant to a modest sub-ambient temperature.</p>

<p>Again, the fridge is not the only heat extraction component of this system.  The system will be designed to work effectively even if the fridge wasn't there.</p>

<p><strong>The Purpose</strong></p>

<p>To be clear: I understand that the mini-fridge is going to pull extra power because of all of the heat generated by the computer components and dumped into the fridge.</p>

<p>I also understand the fridge may not be able to reduce coolant temperatures too terribly much, and that an aquarium chiller may be more effective.</p>

<p>I also understand that to get the most performance in the cases when I really need it I will likely need to manually overclock instead of just relying on XFR.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is partly the fun factor (it would make a great story) and partly the minuscule up-front costs.  I don't want to do anything that would endanger the PC components.  But if I can do it safely and get another 100MHz - 200MHz out of it I would consider that a win.</p>

<p><strong>Previous Research</strong></p>

<p>Google returns many forum posts of users asking if this can be done, and a number of responses saying it’s a bad idea, but no one goes into details as to why.  To further confuse the matter it's unclear if some of these questions involve putting the whole PC in a fridge, as at least one or two advocated submersing the mainboard.</p>

<p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>

<p>The main challenges that I see right off the bat are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finding the right place to drill the input/output holes in the
fridge and properly sealing them to prevent excessive heat loss.</li>
<li>Determining the quantity of heat (I’m not even sure what unit one
uses to measure that) produced by the PC and determining if the
fridge will overwork removing that level of constant heat input.</li>
<li>Could condensation build up on the line running from the fridge into
the PC given that the temperature of the liquid in that branch will
almost certainly be below ambient?</li>

I briefly considered hiring an IT administrator to do this part of the job, but after assessing what they have, I am inclined to think that may be overkill. That being said, I also don't know exactly what I'm doing and I'm trying to learn. They currently have 6 workstation computers all running windows 7 (one of which is running as a server for file sharing, among a few other things).</p>

<p>In preparation I've installed windows 10 professional on a spare computer I have at home and I am trying to implement the same type of setup here using whatever (probably outdated) best practices I know. But I'm running into issues already.</p>

<p>For example, I cannot create a user called ""administrator"". I had always thought that you are going to want an administrator account for all things admin and a regular user account for daily use. Yet I get an error telling me that account cannot be made. I know this can be done, as the machines at my workplace have an administrator account, but that may be something related to the domain, which I do not have.</p>

<p>I think all of this can be managed simply by understanding how to set up and administer a ""workgroup"" with filesharing from the server machine, but my first basic task of creating an administrator has already gone wrong. As  it is I had to turn on SMBv1 on each machine just to get the computers to show up on the ""Workgroup"" in the navigator. </p>

<p>Can someone point me to a good and current best practices resource I can follow for setting up a workgroup with some basic features, like file sharing, etc?</p>

"1572540","Share Photos from mobile without losing metadata?","<p>I am frequently* sent phone-made Photos from trips from other people's Smartphones and likewise want to easily share new photos from trips together with them. The standard methods have long been WhatsApp or Viber, since they cause the Photos to be downloaded (on Android) or easily manually downloaded (on iOS).</p>
<p>However, both apps unconditionally strip <em>all</em> privacy-relevant metadata. When privately sharing photos, however, it would be vastly preferable to preserve at least the date metadata, since it is fundamental for correctly sorting the Photos; By default apps fall back to the creation date stored in the file-system, but unlike exif meta-data, this information can easily get lost when transferring the files to other devices. (Also, it usually is at least by a few days off compared to the original metadata).</p>
<p>Is it somehow possible to preserve the metadata, without losing convenience compared to sending by WhatsApp/Viber? The convenience aspect is important, because I am the one who cares about receiving the metadata, so I need to convince other people to use the solution.</p>

We have in our company the following network stack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internal Clients network 192.168.0.0/24 we call it company LAN</li>
<li>Server network 10.10.0.0/16 </li>
<li>Test LAN 192.168.234.0/24</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the internal network is used for the coworkers' devices, and it's secured behind a firewall with outbound and inbound rules and restrictions.</p>

<p>The Test LAN is a network which we use to test and work with foreign devices (Like plugging customers devices in for updates and various tests), this network has less outbound restrictive rules on the firewall like (TestLAN to any).</p>

<p>Now we are making some enhancements to our networking stack, and my colleague suggested that we must rename the TestLAN to DMZ.</p>

<p>I was against the idea, as my definition of DMZ is a separated network from the usual LAN used mostly to isolate servers before the firewall to grant free access from the internet to the services hosted on those servers in DMZ, and not just a LAN without outbound restrictions which what our TestLAN is.</p>

<p>So what do you think about this, and what would be the correct terming of this Test LAN and whether it's eligible to be defined as a DMZ?</p>

<pre><code>C:\PathToUser\a&gt; cd ""b""
The system cannot find the path specified.

<ol>
<li>Briefly explain how software (in this example DOSBox) replaces some hardware/CPU functions.</li>
<li>What was the rationale behind doing it this way?</li>
</ol>
<p>When trying to think of an aspect of this emulator that I could discuss, I came across the following sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;Since DOSBox can emulate its CPU by interpretation, the environment it emulates is completely independent of the host CPU.&quot;</p>
<p>However, I cannot find the answer to what emulation by interpretation means and what the benefits are of the environment being independent of the host CPU.</p>
<p>Could someone please help me understand it, or suggest another part of DOSBox that is worth talking about in my answer?</p>

<p>First question: Can I get more than one external IP from my IPS so each VPS / dedicated servers can all host on port 80, on the same internet line? I could get more than one internet line for each client, but that would cost the clients big $$. I am already hosting a couple dedicated servers for some clients and none of them are even coming close to using there 100/100 Mbps internet line, if I could share that line between a couple clients that would cut the cost for them, by about $60 per month! They're only using about 5 TB per month, and you could easily put 25TB of bandwidth through that line per month.</p>

<p>Second question: What is the best way to set up a VPS? I have never really played around with that, and I have some clients that don't need / want 12 cores @ 3.46GHz and 32GB of ram. I will be putting about 2 to 4 clients per server.</p>

<p>This is not my main priority right now, but in the future I would like to setup a shared hosting server. If you know of a free automated script that I could run to do this, it would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why MS thinks it's okay to forcibly reboot people's PC in the middle of the night...but for years I was able to prevent this by turning off my windows updates. I also stop and disable the Windows Update service. But over the past few nights, my windows has automatically pulled down updates and forcibly rebooted in spite of the fact that my updates are turned off and the service stopped. I have lots of apps running so this is very disruptive.</p>

<p>I can only assume that they found some sneaky new way to do this without my permission because it shouldn't be possible for this to happen, given my current settings.</p>

<p>How can I prevent it in my current version of windows? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Today I installed the latest version of Skype. When I open Settings --> Audio &amp; Video, it shows that the camera is detected correctly, but instead of the video I can only see a black screen. Audio works fine. There are no webcam settings that I can change in Skype. I tired to restart program many times. A couple of times it did show the video from the camera, but most of the other times it did not. I can not understand how to get it working. Is it blocked by an antivirus software? Then why other programs are not blocked from using the webcam?</p>

Without any further thinking, I thought because only a little dropped on the keyboard, and thought none went in, I continued to use the laptop whilst charging. I used it for about 1-2 hours and it was working fine. It was stupid to do so, as I had some important uni assignment to  continue on. I didn't really think much of the spillage whilst using it.</p>

<p>I turned on the laptop the next day to find out the keys are randomly pressing, with some keys not working. I then realised, ""Gosh, what a terrible mistake last night was!""

<p>2) Second problem the direct link that dropbox give you are not really direct link they contain the name of folder plus at the end ""?dl=0&amp;preview=1GQKV9M.vcf#"" 
and copying the link and then past it in another tab doesn't start any new download. As a result trying to use wget or changing dl=0 per dl=1 also result in errors.</p>

"1189089","Trying to learn modern server setup, need to get the layering correct","<p>In a traditional LAMP server we have Linux running Apache running MySQL and PHP.</p>

<p>I'm currently early in the process of teaching myself a more modern approach as a preamble for teaching myself node.js. So far I have successfully got Ubuntu running on a virtual box, but I'm a little confused by what elements need to be built on each other to finish creating my server.</p>

<p>I want to run node.js on top of docker using composer, git and possibly redis (this may need to be a seperate server, I'm not entirely clear yet). Then I want a similar setup to run php/mysql so my node applications can use the strengths of those technologies as well. This seems sufficiently similar to a production environment to make for a good learning environment.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking the correct layering is:</p>

<ul>
<li>virtual box</li>
<li>running ubuntu with composer, git and other utilities installed</li>
<li>running a docker image</li>
<li>containing a node.js or php/mysql server as appropriate</li>
<li>Which in turn runs the usual code and frameworks</li>
</ul>

<p>Does that look right? I'm most uncertain about the role of docker - whether it should contain the ubuntu image as well and where the composer and git installations should be sat (on the os layer or the docker layer?).</p>

<p>General advice / criticism of this setup would be appreciated.</p>

Presently we have managed to set up the macros for adding new customers, looking up existing customer #'s, creating the invoice with a pop up box to input the customer number which auto populates the customers information into the invoice, a button for adding a product SKU which auto populates the description and pricing.</p>

<p>The main issue we seem to be having is the ability to create a Save Invoice button which copies the cell data from certain cells into a new worksheet.</p>

<p>Pretty much what we want to copy is:</p>

<p>Cells E5 and F5 which are merged cells into the first open space in column A.</p>

<p>Cells E6 and F6 which are merged cells into the first open space in column D.</p>

<p>Cells E7 and F7 which are merged cells into the first open space in column C.</p>

<p>Cell G50 into the first open space in column F.</p>

<p>I recently learned about the <code>CDPATH</code> environment variable, which lists a number of directories for <code>cd</code> to search through - in a sense joining those directories to the current directory, and I wondered if there is something similar for <code>ls</code> and other commands - so that <code>ls</code> would list not only the current directory, but the ones that are 'joined' to it, and the files will be available as files in the current directory. One reason why it might be desirable is if you have a directory with a number of files that you want to be visible in the home directories of several users.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this would be hugely useful or beneficial, and I know a number of ways in which to achieve a similar effect, eg with symbolic links; it was just a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Anyway after my computer fixed its slow performance problems it now will turn off Windows Update whenever it wants to. I figure this is some sort of virus or security flaw that is making it turn off, but I am very concerned because i have ran multiple virus/malware scans with 2 different scanners (Avast and Malwarebytes) and they have picked up nothing. </p>

<p>In Application in Event Viewer there are multiple cases of Software Protection stopping by an unknown user. </p>

<p>Most of security was logging on and off, besides some misspelled passwords.</p>

<p>And then in System: The Windows Update service entered the stopped state. Then a couple hours later i turned it back on. User is N/A. </p>

<p>What i am asking is how can i fix this? I am concerned about my security of this computer and files that are on it. I havent updated my computer lately, even though Windows Update says i should, but i am nervous to do so because i am afraid this virus/malware/rootkit could do more damage.</p>

<p>This trusty (but dusty) old computer of mine has always filled my needs and i would hate to have to get a new computer or erase my hard drive.</p>

I run 2 SSDs in RAID 0 and CrystalDiskInfo reports they're 100% OK. However, when I either create a file or delete a file, the whole explorer basically freezes for up to 60 seconds. Here are some cases where it happens and doesn't happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downloading a file (opening it works fine, but ""Show in folder""/open in Explorer freezes it)</li>
<li>Moving files around freezes it</li>
<li>Deleting a file, folder, or shortcut freezes it</li>
</ul>

<p>I've ran pretty much every good software out there to try and fix this, but none of them has worked. I've ran:</p>

<ul>
<li>chkdsk</li>
<li>CCleaner (and Registry Cleaner)</li>
<li>MalwareBytes</li>
</ul>

<p>It might be an indexing issue, perhaps? Like it's trying to update the indices, but the index file/database is too large or something.</p>

if a request is received they have 21 days to complete the request. 
if a request is received and further information is needed from the client, my team needs to send a request for further information within 21 days and then check to see if the information has been returned within a further 28 day window. </p>

<p>I want to track:
Date request received
Date further information has been requested
Date request should be finalised, based on whether the request could be managed with what information we had OR in the event further information is needed, the revised date the team needs to follow up and close the case.</p>

<p>My sticking point is getting a due date calculation to generate that takes into consideration whether there is further information requested or not. </p>

<p>There are variable timelines depending on the nature of the clients case and this is creating difficulty for me to track the different possible deadlines. </p>

<p>The main variables are: 
From the date a request is received, we have 21 days to provide a response. 
If a request is received, and further information is needed, we have 21 days from the date of the request received to ask for further information. The client has 28 days to return this to us. </p>

<p>Once the further information is returned to us, we have 14 days to complete the request or ask for further information again. IN the case there is no further information needed, the due date will be 14 days from when the information is received. If further information is needed again, we need to ask for it within the 14 days and the client has a further 28 days to return it to us. </p>

<p>After the last recovery on a Sony VAIO running Win 10 10.0.17134 Build 17134, I immediately opened event viewer and saw a bizarre series of actions taken before I had even logged on as a User/Administrator:</p>

But, it appears that any laptop (I have a VAIO, ASUS, DELL and LENOVO) running Windows is hijacked this way and migrated to a domain server controlled by someone else. I've set them up over public and private networks at home or in the office. Doesn't seem to care. The one constant is that they were all setup over networks connected to Spectrum/TWC connections.</p>

<p>When I operate the machines as though they are running like normal personal compauters, troubles arise and they shut down...sometimes claiming registry errors that will not even allow them to boot into WinRE. </p>

<p>Over 6 years, I've taken them to IT experts. I've run every malware scanner in the known universe. Nothing helps.</p>

<p>What is happening? 
How can I identify the origin of the SIDs causing the trouble? 
How can I identify who controls the domain server where they are migrated?</p>

I already found how to get any ISO for any build version, but I would need to boot the computer with this and I can't because I don't have physical access to it (I access it remotely through TeamViewer, that's how we usually manage our users' computers) and that sort of operation is beyond the capabilities of most of our users. I know the media creation tool is capable of upgrading Windows 10 from within Windows itself, so is there a way to obtain a Windows 10 media creation tool that would install 1703 instead of 1709? Currently, the one that's easily found on Microsoft's website will only install 1709 and I don't want it.</p>

<p>So, I don't just want to run a program in a sandboxed software environment ( like presumably in <a href=""https://www.sandboxie.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.sandboxie.com/</a> ); I'd like to have a ""clean slate desktop"" on demand.</p>

<p>I have just learned that there is <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/399153/windows-10s-new-sandbox-feature-is-everything-weve-always-wanted/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows 10’s New Sandbox Feature ...</a> which looks like exactly what I need:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/1BKpj.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1BKpj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>... but unfortunately, this is only for Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Home cannot use it. </p>

<p>Plus, I could imagine having to borrow a laptop for a demo/presentation, which might be Windows 7 or 8, so I'd like to have a possibility to basically install an application, that allows me to have a ""clean slate"" desktop on demand.</p>

<p>Now, the only other option I can think of, is installing some virtual machine (VirtualBox or VMWare), installing another instance of Windows in it, setting up a snapshot after installation completes, and then restoring to snapshot each time an installation is complete.</p>

<p>This I don't quite like, because I basically have to use up disk space for two operating systems, just to do a ""clean slate"" demo. Plus, I'm not even sure it's legal to set up a virtual machine of the same legal Windows install you have on the same machine.</p>

<p>Of course, I could also set up a separate user account on Windows, but then all programs I install will end up having bits and pieces in the host OS, even if I uninstall later (and I'd rather not uninstall even, I'd just like to close the virtual session and have all those changes gone).</p>

<p>So I was wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to set up a virtual machine on Windows, such that it refers to the host physical \media, and it reads the main OS files from there - but then, it accepts a hard disk image as the destination for the rest (user profile data, newly installed programs, etc)?</li>
<li>Else, is there some application, that does the same as Windows 10 Pro Sandbox, but can be installed on most other version of Windows (say, down to Windows 7)?</li>
<li>Else, what other options would I have, to achieve a clean slate desktop, which allows installation of programs in a sandboxed environment, such that when I close the sandbox, all of the changes due to the installation of programs in the sandbox are gone?</li>

<p>It has proved intractable. Three processes are now running constantly on my machine, using CPU and doing goodness knows what. </p>

<p>And they're unkillable. I can't kill the processes, all I get is an ""Access is denied"".</p>

<p>The processes are called:</p>

<ul>
<li>svnlgau.exe </li>

<p>I've traced the three executables to these folders:</p>

C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\igfxmtc
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\rtnpeku

<li>Changing the owner of the folders to the Administrator</li>
<li>Using ""Unlocker"" on the directories to take possession of them</li>
<li>Booting in safe mode as an administrator, killing the processes and deleting the directories</li>

Every single computer I purchased during that time had a fingerprint sensor, from the cheap $300 Pentium laptop to the more expensive machines (e.g. my VAIO Z series valued at around $2,000 at the time).</p>

<p>However, I've noticed that most consumer laptops sold these days no longer have the sensor, not even high-end machines. The last time I visited a computer store, there was only one model that had a fingerprint sensor, and that wasn't a ""swipe"" sensor (it was a ""tap and hold"" sensor like the one found on smartphones like my Nexus 6P). From what I can tell, it was right around when manufacturers gravitated toward smaller form factors, right around the Windows 8 era, when this trend stopped.</p>

<p>Why don't consumer laptops feature the swipe fingerprint sensor anymore, which used to be such a common feature earlier, with just about every laptop (other than small netbooks) featuring it?</p>

<p>And if the concern was that swipe sensors aren't secure enough, why isn't the smartphone-like ""tap and hold"" sensor more common?</p>

When the DHCP Request goes to the DHCP server from the system, it offers the IP address as broadcast. But the question is sometimes the DHCP server uses the ARP request before offering the IP address to the client. So what is the reason for using the ARP request from the DHCP server before offering the IP address . Someone of you may think that the ARP request is for checking the IP address which is ready to offer is already assigned or not. But my question is, the DHCP server stores the assigned dynamic IP address as table, So why should the ARP request is need instead of using the DHCP table for checking the IP is assigned or not.</p>

<p>I am attempting to learn more about information security. So just as an experiment I downloaded Kali Linux and a large dictionary of passwords gathered from several leaks, etc. and I used aircrack-ng to see if I could  get into my wireless network. </p>

<p>To my surprise (horror?) my wifi password must have been in the dictionary and it was very easy to hack. </p>

<p>My wifi password is admittedly, not very secure but very arbitrary. So I am having a hard time believing anyone else would have had that password, which is making me wonder if I had been hacked at some point. </p>

<p>This is where I lack understanding. I only ever used this password for my wireless network. </p>

<p>Here is my question, is there any way that a router could be hacked from across the internet if someone had my IP address? Or would someone literally have to sit outside my house and try to hack into my network? I did have a port open for a multiplayer game if that makes a difference, I understand that can be a security risk, but apart from that, don't know much more. </p>

So, how is this achieved by whatsapp? Private key never goes on network, and was not even stored on user's device anymore after updating the app or changing new device.

<li>I have two NAS' (NAS1 = 192.168.1.18 and NAS2 = 192.168.1.118) connected to a Linksys Switch WRT160N (DD-WRT configured to act as a simple switch or so i think - 192.168.1.111).</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to make the NAS' (#3) be available on the network (#1), by connecting to the Ethernet NIC (#2). A bridged-connection between Ethernet + Wireless (#2) would make the NAS' available.</p>

<p>Configuring the bridged-connection is what I have issues with.
There are two main recurring problems that keeps this bridge from working.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The bridge doesn't automatically work. I must set a static IP on the bridge and also add a static IP on the Ethernet before adding it to the bridge. Sometimes this will work for a day before stopping. What is the best way to configure this without fail?</p></li>
<li><p>If the bridge does work, the internet connection on #2 becomes dreadfully slow. I suspect it takes time to find the valid gateway + DNS. Perhaps the switch (#3) needs a certain config? Or the computer (#2) needs a persistent route?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know troubleshooting my specific setup would be difficult especially not knowing how the switch (#3) is exactly configured. But i'm wondering... if you were to make this setup work, what would you check? and is there any route or dd-wrt setting i should be checking?</p>

<p>It's currently set so that, on double-clicking a BAT file, it opens in Notepad++, so it's clearly something I did inadvertently (probably trying to set a program for editing, as opposed to opening). I've looked in ""Settings / Choose default apps by file type"" and see that BAT and CMD are both set for Notepad++, but I don't know how to reset it. If I click on the current setting, it allows me to choose Notepad++ (again, I guess) or ""find an app in the app store""; after a LONG time searching (I guess) it says there are no results for "".bat"".

"1419655","Domain name lapsed and taken by Chinese site - what can I do?","<p>For well over a decade I have had a domain name of the form <code>myfullname.com</code>. I am an academic and I had a simple static site there that listed my publications and gave an outline of my research.</p>

<p>I last updated it probably a year or two ago, and I haven't looked at it since then, but it's been in my email signature for years. Just now I looked at it, and discovered that it no longer displays my web site but a generic site in Chinese, which appears to contain links to porn sites. A <code>whois</code> search reveals that it's owned by <code>www.maff.com</code>, which appears to be a Chinese domain name registration site.</p>

<p>The payments for my domain used to go out automatically and I never paid a lot of attention to them, but it now seems the last one was in 2016. The registration site I was using, <code>123reg.co.uk</code>, seems to have forgotten that I exist, in that none of my email addresses seem to be associated with an account there.</p>

<p>My question is simply whether there is anything I can do. I have a fairly unusual first name and surname, and it's inconceivable that anyone would actually want to use this domain name, apart from me or 10 or so other people who happen to share my name. Is this just a case of forget about it and register another domain, or is there anything I can do to get it back?</p>

"1582567","How do I get single-Enter execution with Oh My Zsh when using event designators?","<p>In plain zsh, when I press Enter, it runs the command I've typed. Hooray! This includes performing any necessary event designator substitutions all in one go, though it prints them out along the way:</p>
<pre><code>~ % echo a b c # ^M
a b c
~ % echo !$ # ^M
echo c
c
~ % echo !-2:2 # ^M
echo b
b
~ % 
</code></pre>
<p>I've decorated the above block with <code># ^M</code> to indicate where I pressed the Enter key.</p>
<p>In contrast, with Oh My Zsh, when I hit Enter, it runs the command immediately but only if there are no event designator substitutions to be made. Other types of substitutions happen inline, but if I've used an event designator, instead of actually running the command, it gives me a new line with a new prompt and the substitution having been made. Example, same <code># ^M</code> business as above:</p>
<pre><code>~ % echo a b c # ^M
a b c
~ % echo !$ # ^M
~ % echo c # ^M
c
~ % echo !-2:2 # ^M
~ % echo b # ^M
b
~ % echo $(echo a b) c # ^M
a b c
~ % 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I have to hit Enter twice to make most of the commands run, though the final one with the <code>$()</code> substitution runs in a single go.</p>
<p>How do I configure OMZ to use the normal zsh behavior here, or otherwise just configure zsh to go back to normal after OMZ has performed its dark magic? I can't seem to find any documentation on how to make zsh do this in the first place.</p>
<p>(I know that I can use the Tab key to have the substitution performed immediately. That's fine, but I know I typed the thing correctly and I just want it to run without seeing it again first.)</p>

"1582574","Prior to Windows 7, did windows not have any ability to group themselves in the Taskbar in this manner?","<p>Since even Windows 7 is now long since EOL, this is not a practical question of a problem I'm facing. Rather, I'm curious whether or not I would've been able to run my system back in those days of Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98 and earlier.</p>
<p>Basically, I constantly have a large number of cmd.exe windows running. Actually, it's PHP.exe, but it looks like/uses cmd.exe &quot;wrapped around it&quot;, kinda. It's hard to explain and I don't fully understand it myself. The point is that I have a lot of cmd.exe processes/windows running at all times, and new ones are spawned all the time as others finish (and thus disappear).</p>
<p>Basically, I simulate &quot;threads&quot; or &quot;doing many things at once&quot; by having them all run their own separate php.exe instance (which in practice means cmd.exe instances).</p>
<p>This works flawlessly on my Windows 10, and the same in Windows 8, and Windows 7 (unless I misremember). However, I'm foggy on Windows Vista, Windows XP and earlier. I'm not sure that they &quot;grouped&quot; taskbar icons like Windows does now.</p>
<p>If those earlier versions of Windows did not, which I suspect and seem to remember, does that mean that I would constantly get a big ugly mess of &quot;minimized window bars&quot; in the Taskbar, appearing and disappearing and making my &quot;actual&quot; applications hard to use/switch between as a result, and of course the visual pollution/annoyance of having things appear and disappear/rearrange in the Taskbar all the time?</p>
<p>If such was the case, would there have been any built-in/reasonable way to &quot;mitigate&quot; this? Or would I essentially not have been able to run my PHP CLI-based system on Windows Vista and earlier? (In sane/clean manner, without going crazy.)</p>
<p>Even on Windows 10, I have had to use this third-party &quot;Winaero Tweaker&quot; application to disable the Taskbar thumbnails and instead get a nice list of processes, so even on Windows 10, there was minor tweaking necessary. (Well, not strictly <em>necessary</em>, but those thumbnail icons that Windows 10 uses when there's few enough processes in a given Taskbar group were very annoying when I tried to get a quick overview of what is open/currently running.)</p>
<p>I have no copy of Windows XP/Vista/98 left to install this in a VM and try it out myself, sadly.</p>
<p>I am fully able to use my Windows 10 desktop and never notice my system other than seeing that there is a cmd.exe Taskbar group right there, which I can click once to get a list of what exactly is running. This is what I'm trying to determine if older versions of Windows used to be able to do. (Or something which would work equally well and pleasantly and without problems as I use other applications and the Tasbar.)</p>

<h2>My Question / Problem on Automating Editing of Photos (probably with GIMP)</h2>
<p>I do not know scripting in GIMP and am a relative novice in photo editing. I can get by when it comes to editing one photo at a time. However, I am hoping to find a solution or easy way <strong>to learn the basics of how to</strong> automate the following.</p>
<p>The input images are of TIFF format (one image per file) and of much higher resolution than that the desired output. To start, by hand, using a <code>selection box</code> with a <code>4:3</code> fixed ratio (I know how to do this), I will select the desired content I would like; then I would like to automate the following steps either through a tool that may exist for which I do not presently know, a solution I haven't even contemplated in this posting, or through guidance in designing a script that automates the following basic algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crop to selection</li>
<li>Change the resolution to 1600x1200 (5.62429796 px/mm)</li>
<li>Export the file with the same base name as a JPG image</li>
<li>Close the current image (without overwriting original TIFF)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Each of these four tasks I know how to do as stand-alone tasks within GIMP</strong>. However, I have no idea where to start when it comes to combining them into an automated action. As I expect to do this to hundreds (if not eventually thousands) of photos, finding/developing a solution that automates the task once I have hand-selected the content I desire would be wonderful.</p>
<p>With my GIMP skill set, the most expeditious solution I can personally develop at this moment would be to crop the image to the desired content and save as a TIFF with appended file name like <code>&quot;base cropped.tif&quot;</code>. Then, I could use ImageMagick's CLI to batch adjust the resolution (which I know how to do).</p>
<p>A GIMP solution such as the one I described feels like it would be the most efficient when it comes to minimizing how much time I have to spend in front of my computer on this specific project. <strong>If you have guidance that would allow my novice abilities to achieve this using GIMP or if you have any suggestions on how I can make the process quicker (using something other than GIMP - that is free - for instance), your advice is welcomed and appreciated</strong>. Note, I cannot automate the selection process itself because the location of desired content will change with each photo (sometimes it will be most of the original photo and other times it will be 1/4 of the original photo located in a non-centered location).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I recently purchased a Synology NAS DS918+ and have a few beginner questions to ask. I have 2 people that would like to assess the NAS (One is at a local university, the other is on the other side of the country).</p>

<p>I have 2 questions id like to ask.</p>

<p>1) What is the ""best practice"" way to allow these 2 people to connect to the NAS?</p>

<p>2) Would it help to install a VPN on the router? or do they have to log in to a VPN on their side giving the illusion that they are on my home network in order to access it?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help or advice in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Update: I was given this information on the 'networkengineering' stackexchange.</strong></p>

<p>Basically, there are two different approaches:</p>

<p>1) Given the NAS is hardenend and isn't affected by hacking, you could map/open the required port/s on the firewall. Without hardening, setting up access to the NAS doesn't only endanger the NAS and its data but also the entire network.</p>

<p>2) Provide transparent access through a VPN tunnel. VPN allows remote access without exposing your network devices to hacking from the Internet. You might want to set up VPN rules to restrict remote users to the devices in question.</p>

<p><strong>My Response</strong></p>

<p>Awesome! thanks for your response! An additional question. Are we talking about the end user VPN'ing into my network? The reason I'm asking is the 2 end user have 0 technical experience so I want to make the process as simple and foolproof for them - given this info which of the 2 options would you recommend? and could you be so kind to point me to a guide to enact such a setup?</p>

Over the years, I experienced it many times that suddenly you want to open some old pictures just to scratch your head and wonder wether there wasn't another photo in that folder.
I store all my project files and pictures in my dropbox and have additionally an external RAID 1 disk (WDMyBookMirror) where I backup these files to.
About a year ago I had upgraded from an older MyBook Mirror to a new one. The old one was still lying around with the old data, and I decided to run a comparison with FileMerge of the folder trees of the old disk with the current state of my new Backup disk that is in use.
Turns out about 10 files have disappeared in this one year or so from my new disk. Random photos and videos. If I hadn't run the comparison, I would never have noticed.</p>

<p>This gets me to the question. How can I store my data to be really sure that I'm not losing any files without noticing?</p>

<p>Apparently the RAID 1 didn't safe me from the silent data corruption. Neither did the NTFS file system on it, and a cloud solution such as dropbox would probably just sync the erroneous file changes into the cloud, corrupting/losing the data in other places too.
Creating regular backups of the backup also won't inform me about pictures silently lost or corrupted.</p>

<p>So, what to do? I read a bit about ReFS and ZFS. Is that the way to go?</p>

<p>I don't mind paying for redundancy - but what's the way to store my data so I can be SURE that silent data corruption can't happen?</p>

What I have currently found out is that there are two modes &quot;ganged&quot; and &quot;unganged&quot; and that there is little difference between them performance-wise.</p>
<p>With ganged mode I understood that each 128-bit word is split in a two 64 bit words, and those are combined when read / written using two channels at the same time. That would mean that for every 128 bits one would probably contain the lower 64 bits (/8 bytes) and the other the higher 64 bits. So byte addresses 0-7 are on one DIMM, and the next 8-15 are on the other. Is this correct?</p>

I know that torrenting can harm your SSD so I decided to create a RAM disk where I temporary store my torrents until they are finished. Is this a good practice?</p>

<p>I am thinking it is because there are no more writes to the disk. However, there is less RAM for the system to use and page swapping will happen more often, which will cause more writes to the SSD anyway. Eventually, even the RAM disk may be swapped to the SSD and then I will have won nothing (maybe just that I will somehow batch writes to SSD).</p>

<p>For some reason, the UEFI entry gets removed after the system is shut down or restarted after having boot from that specific entry.</p>

<p>This also applies to custom boot entries added manually.</p>

<pre><code># modprobe efivars
# efibootmgr

Boot0002  Ubuntu Shim 2

Boot0005  Ubuntu Shim 5
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Ubuntu Shim #</code> entries are entries manually added with this command:</p>

<pre><code>efibootmgr -c -w -l '\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi' -L ""Ubuntu Shim #""
</code></pre>

<p>Once I restart the system it gives the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Reboot and Select proper Boot Device
or Insert Boot Media in selected device and press a key
</code></pre>

<p>If I press ctrl+alt+delete, and press DEL to enter the Bios Setup, I can see <code>Ubuntu Shim 5</code> as the first boot option, and I can now boot Ubuntu successfully, and the previous Boot entry is no longer there.</p>

<pre><code># modprobe efivars
# efibootmgr
BootCurrent: 0005
BootOrder: 0005,0002,0001
Boot0001  Windows Boot Manager
Boot0002  Ubuntu Shim 2
Boot0005* Ubuntu Shim 5
</code></pre>

<p>If I restart the system again and immediately enter the BIOS, I see <code>Windows Boot Manager</code> as the first boot option, but I can now boot Ubuntu successfully, and the previous Boot entry is no longer there.</p>

<pre><code># modprobe efivars
# efibootmgr

<p>I bought a new laptop with 32gigs of ram, and I'd be willing to sign an affidavit in a court of law that the usage has never, <strong><em>ever</em></strong> gone above 19GB of ram, and only then whilst playing a game with a machine learning process training in the background.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my ""in use"" and compressed memory right now is 15.GB (2.5GB compressed). Why is Windows compressing memory when it doesn't need to?
 Multitasking is still fast, however when I resume some old open applications, it sometimes still takes a few seconds for them to become responsive.</p>

<p>I realize, based on prior discussions, that disabling memory compression, paging etc will most likely not fix this problem and will instead make the system unstable. I realize also that a lot of professionals actually believe that Windows 10 will only compress or page memory when it needs to.</p>

<p>I speak from experience that this is not true. Windows is compressing/paging memory when it does not need to, and when it has never, since its installation, reached close to its maximum capacity.</p>

<p>With this in mind, given infinite ram, is there any way to disable the delay when alt-tabbing to old processes that were never shut? To me this is a fundamental design flaw if there is no way to disable this delay, whatever the cause, if the user were in theory to have an infinite amount of ram, and Windows 10 would nevertheless compress ram anyway.</p>

When I booted it up, it went through a whole bunch of automatic updates, which makes sense.  It eventually ended up running Windows 10 (this may have been one of the automatic updates).</p>

<p>What doesn't make sense is that Windows Explorer shows less than 2GB of free space out of 28.5GB on my C drive.  This makes it virtually impossible to install any new software.  I tried running disk cleanup and removing all programs that I had no use for, but this hardly put a dent in the used space.</p>

<p>Visible folders show nothing unusual.  There is both a Windows package and a Windows10Upgrade package, but the latter doesn't seem to be taking up excessive space.  Other than that there's just the Program Files and Program Files (x86), Users, and a small number of my own files that don't take up much room.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Wireshark pops up but no traffic captured as I can't see ""tcpdump"" command getting executed on .</p>

<p>To confirm plink works, I tested similar command on a directly accessible host and everything works. Wireshark pops up with live traffic capture.</p>

<pre><code>plink.exe -ssh -pw &lt;password&gt; &lt;username&gt;@&lt;my-host&gt; ""/usr/sbin/tcpdump -ni ens192 -s 0 -w - not port 22"" | ""C:\Program Files\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe"" -k -i -

<li><p>The DVD presently seems the most sturdy, but is obviously limited to about 4GB per disc. The data is on a disc which is disconnected from the reader with the moving parts than can be replaced. Would Blu Ray be a better/similar option. I think that is about 25GB per disc for a comparible price?</p>

<li><p>I am presently saving on DVD+R, but can only find BluRay-R. What is the difference? I was always told to buy +R DVDs as they were better, but I never knew why. Can someone explain?</p>

"1287573","Will Compressing an Entire USB Flash Drive Actually Increase Performance?","<p>As we know, USB flash drives are generally <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/253579/why-are-usb-flash-drives-so-much-slower-than-solid-state-drives""><em>very slow</em> in data transfer rates</a>. USB 3 has significantly increased the rates data transfers, but it's still much slower than even traditional mechanical HDDs - and many people still do not own the hardware to benefit from the new revision.</p>

<p>Also, compression/decompression slows down opening and saving files, but I would imagine that this is only true for I/O on an HDD/SSD/SSHD where the transfer rates are faster than the rates of a USB drive.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of any performance tests that shows potential benefits from compressing an entire USB flash drive (particularly USB 2.0)? I would imagine that a computer's processor can decompress a file much faster than the USB can read an uncompressed file - so the larger the compression is on a USB - the less time it would take to read while the much faster processor can decompress a file quickly.</p>

<p>I would like to add a side note that I do not want to consider highly compressed media such as <code>.jpg</code> or encoded video where there will be little to no benefit from further compression. I am mostly talking about compression that would be in the range of 10%+ savings in disk space.</p>

<p>If I cut with -ss 0 -t 1,   it produces a file that is 1s 22ms.</p>

<p>So that's not too bad that's fairly close to one second. 1.022 seconds is quite good for an attempt to cut one second.</p>

<p>If I cut with -ss 0 -t 2, it produces a file that is 3s 19ms   That is terrible! it's meant to be one second!</p>

<p>If I cut with -ss 0 -t 30 then it is fine it does 30s 1ms.</p>

If date added to Column B, add 1 year.
If date added to Column C, add 2 years.
If date added to Column D, add 3 years.</p>

"1201110","Best placement for Power Supply Unit in a full ATX case?","<p>I've read a few dozen tech articles about Power Supply Units and which may be best for inside a PC case, whether if it's sucking fresh air in, or blowing hot air out to keep it cool. But thing is that hot air rises, so it puts me to asking this question in particular, and what kind of PC cases I should be looking for to best suit for maximum efficient cooling as possible for the PSU for the rest of the components inside it.</p>

<p>The question is; What is the best placement to put the PSU? would it be better if it's at the top of the case or the bottom of the case? and I'm talking for PC cases that are full tower ATX cases that can stand up. I've been trying to look around for a decent full tower ATX case where it lets you choose where to put the PSU. would it really matter that much if the PSU sits on the bottom or at the top at all? My most likely guess is that if it's sitting on the bottom the heat will rise from the PSU if it sat at the bottom of the case, and causing everything else to heat up more inside the case.</p>

<p>I guess this question is basically asking, What kind of full tower ATX case and PSU would be beneficial for maximum cooling efficiency that minimizes heat. I've looked at open full tower ATX cases, but I can see already a downside to that, because dust will collect more easily on everything inside it since it's more openly vented and everythings more exposed, this just makes me really unsure what kind of case I SHOULD be looking for when it comes to PC building. I'm trying to put together ideas for a future gaming PC build that would work best, that has plenty room as well as efficient cooling.</p>

"1290785","What Does the Abbreviation NSX Stand for in VMware NSX for vSphere?","<p>This may be better suited for a Networking Exchange, but as I have no desire to join that group I wanted to try SuperUser first. </p>

<p>The title pretty much says it all. I've recently begun diving into VMware's Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) and the acronym NSX appears to be almost synonymous with this. Just as it would be difficult to learn about (SDDC) without knowing what SDDC actually stands for I must also find out what NSX stands for. </p>

<p>To be clear on this, I am not looking for a generic answer such as ""<em>VMware NSX is a virtual networking and security software product family created from... bla bla bla...</em>"" I'm well versed in Google Queries myself. What I am looking for is exactly what the acronym (NSX) stands for- N.... S.... X.....</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I'm not entirely convinced that (NSX) actually stands for anything, however the thought of an IT company labeling a product as such without any real reasoning is both troubling and frustrating, so I figured I'd reach out to the community before silently cursing under breath. Hopefully someone is able to uncover the mystery that can't. </p>

"1290832","Execute a Windows process with lower privileges","<p>I see many threads here about how can a software be programmed to ask for administrator privileges on Windows, but in my case I have a software installer that runs with administrator privileges and, in the end of installation, it must execute another process with limited privileges (as the logged user). Both installer and installed softwares was created by me using Delphi.</p>

<p>I am researching about this subject for all day long and it seems to be a very difficult task to achieve by programm language only. My question is if there is some Windows command that I can use to ""call"" the executable with lower privileges or maybe a manifest configuration that I can incorporate to the installed software to avoid it runs with admin privileges. Well, any ideas are welcome!</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>If I decide to use new screws, what screws exactly should I use? Lenovo does not offer 'official screws'.</p>

<p>And what screwdriver would be the most apt for the work? I see that a common household Phillips screwdriver just fits, but wonder whether it would be better to use a JIS or Pozidrive? What tool would do the cleaner job? </p>

<p>My particular laptop does not have a service bay to replace HDD or RAM, you just have to pry open the whole back part. So I assume I'll could be opening it for new HDD soon, then new RAM sometime, new battery,  clean the fan. </p>

"1427457","How can I automatically organize files within a folder based on the name?","<p>I have a folder with over 4,000 PDF files that my company used to use as a loading dock to upload into our CRM as they were scanned in. We are now switching software and this folder is all that will remain of our files that we want to keep from past jobs. Each file is in this format:</p>

<pre><code>companyname - proof.pdf
companyname - notes.pdf
companyname two - proof.pdf
companyname two - vendor file.pdf

Does anyone know of a way I could run a script or something to automatically create a folder for ""companyname"" and move each file with that matching name into said folder?

Simply put, I'm trying to clone my user drive (separate from my system drive) to a larger one and just point to the new drive for windows to use and access.  Unfortunately, all I can find is tutorials on how to move individual user folders to a new drive, which I already did with the current one, and that just seems a tad too superfluous.  Does anyone know how to simply just clone the old drive over to the new one and use that from now on, without having to manually repoint all my folders individually?</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch!</p>

And hard resets usually fix it, but sometimes, it does not, and i end up on startup repair. One time, when the startup repair finished, my user profile got corrupted (temporary user login only), and i'm not sure if it is related to the hard drive. I ended up resetting and everything was fine again. I also did a hard reset once on a BSOD error, but it didnt show any ""noticeable errors"". Not until a few weeks ago. My laptop suddenly displayed a ""No Bootable Drive"" error while the laptop is running. I checked the BIOS and it does not detect my HDD. i tried these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shaked the laptop to check if something's loose</li>
<li>Applied pressure</li>
<li>Few taps on the laptop</li>
<li>Checked BIOS</li>
</ol>

<p>But so far, they did not help. I sent the laptop to the service center and im still waiting for it up until now. My question is, do my hard resets at boot caused my HDD to fail? or is it a problem with the HDD itself? Or is it overuse?</p>

"1293970","Why does Windows 7 bizarrely present two different versions of the same file?","<p>I've stumbled across what I consider to be some very bizarre behaviour by Windows 7 (it may apply to later versions of Windows too but I'm testing on Win7) for files in certain locations and I can't seem to find any information about it on Google, so I was wondering whether someone who knows about Windows internals could explain this to me.</p>

<p>So basically, this behaviour exhibits itself for files in certain directories.  I'm not sure which ones exactly but it seems to include some directories in <code>Program Files (x86)</code>; for the purposes of my testing I used the install directory for Europa Universalis 3, which is <code>Program Files (x86)\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis III</code>.</p>

<p>This behaviour applies to files already in the directory, but to produce a clean reproducible demonstration I started by creating a file <code>text.txt</code> on the desktop.  The file contained the text:</p>

<pre><code>Hello world!
</code></pre>

<p>I like to use EditPad Lite 5.4.0 for my main text editor (yeah I know it's old but I've gotten used to it) but I also have Vim for Windows 8.0.586 installed.  When I open the file in either, I see the same text, and when I edit the text in either, both programs see the same edited text.  So far, so good.</p>

<p>I copy the file into <code>Program Files (x86)\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis III</code>, and get a prompt for admin access to be able to copy the file, which I allow.  This is where the weirdness begins.  I open that copied file in EditPad Lite, add some text, and save (file does not appear as read-only):</p>

<pre><code>Hello world!
Edited with EditPad Lite.
</code></pre>

<p>I then open the file with Vim and Vim shows the OLD version of the file:</p>

<pre><code>Hello world!
</code></pre>

<p>I try to edit and save but Vim sees this file as read-only!  So I open with Vim as Administrator, and edit the file and save:</p>

<pre><code>Hello world!
Edited with Vim.
</code></pre>

<p>When I open the file with EditPad Lite again, I see the EditPad version of the file!  So now we have 2 versions of the file which I will term the ""EditPad version"" and the ""Vim version"".</p>

<p><strong>""EditPad"" version (IS NOT read-only):</strong></p>

<pre><code>Hello world!
Edited with EditPad Lite.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>""Vim"" version (IS read-only):</strong></p>

<pre><code>Hello world!
Edited with Vim.
</code></pre>

<p>Even a reboot doesn't change things, so it doesn't seem to be some sort of Windows memory caching; it's actually persisting these 2 different versions of the file to disk!  Upon further experimentation, I determined that different programs seem to access different versions of the file:</p>

<p><strong>""Vim"" version of the file:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Vim 8.0.586</li>
<li>Vim 8.0.586 as administrator</li>
<li>7-Zip 16.04 (64-bit)</li>
<li>Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Windows 7 Notepad</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>""EditPad"" version of the file:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>EditPad Lite 5.4.0</li>
<li>Europa Universalis 3</li>
<li>Windows XP Notepad</li>
</ul>

<p>What on Earth is Windows 7 doing here?  Why does it present 2 different versions of the file, one being read-only and the other not?  My best guess is that there are two different system calls being used and Windows 7 presents a different version of the file to the different calls, or perhaps 64-bit programs see one version of the file and 32-bit ones see a different version?  Can anyone explain this and is this behaviour documented anywhere?</p>

<p>As you can see, those two options are exactly the same price for the same GB of storage. My understanding has always been that SSD's are more expensive compared to HDD's because SSD's are faster and more reliable (less prone to breakage, because no moving parts). So I am a little baffled as to why the HDD is the same price as the SSD. I'm not familiar with RAID 0, so my thinking is that there is some benefit that RAID 0 would give me that the SSD does not have. But I don't know what that could be. Upon clicking the &quot;Help Me Choose&quot; link (<a href=""https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-hdd-consumer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-hdd-consumer</a>), the description on the opened page describes pretty much what I have already said:  Solid-state drives are lightweight and cooler than standard hard drives, they greatly outperform HDDs in read/write speeds, they have improved performance and durability, and that they are better for mobile users. That page also says that the cost per GB on an HDD is lower compared to SSD. If that's the case, then why are the RAID 0's (HDD's) priced exactly the same as the SSD's? I must be missing something.</p>
<p>My gut is telling me to just go with the SSD, since I've always understood those to be faster and more reliable. Can someone shed some light on that?</p>
<p>Also, bonus question: they also give a third, much more expensive option below all that: RAID 0 Plus. I have no clue as to what benefits that might have. Any help on that option would be greatly appreciated as well.</p>

"1594163","Full-text searching, how fast one can find ""Linus Torvalds"" into the linux kernel?","<p>Three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, what are the fastest full-text search tools?</li>
<li>Are there full-text search tools capable of reporting fullpaths of files containing hit(s), FAST?</li>
<li>Is Linus Torvalds right about AVX512 being garbage, can we do better than AVX2?</li>
</ul>
<p>A full-text search enthusiast here, my question is what tools are out there that can perform HIGH-SPEED searches?<br />
AFAIK, there are only two, <a href=""https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep</a> and my <a href=""https://www.overclock.net/threads/cpu-benchmark-finding-linus-torvalds.1754066/page-2#post-28650381"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NyoTengu</a>, are there other tools?<br />
I find this question unanswered since early x86 days when 80286's 16bit Assembler dominated the searches, nowadays with 512bit Assembler at hand, how things have changed?! This is the question/<strong>quest</strong>!</p>
<p>As a follow-up, how fast AVX512 can perform, my current record (traversing the linux kernel 5.8.5) is 11.1 GB/s on AVX2 laptop, can we reach 15 GB/s on e.g. Intel Core i5-1035G4?!</p>
<p>Also, I see many users, including myself, asking for a tool searching into a tree containing 20,000++ files, and reporting the fullpaths of files containing a given needle, wonder is there a tool combining them all (similar to TARring) with a (8,8) bytes offset (start,end) index pair for each file, thus current C source of NyoTengu could easily be enhanced so it can quickly say the reported hit/offset (which is 8 bytes) falls between those two!? I fully expect, with modern 5GB/s nvme SSDs, such searches to saturate those 5GB/s.</p>

"1294826","Corrupted Linux hard drive. How to recover files?","<p>have totally broken one a Linux device. I can't login in terminal try, and the GUI screen won't come on, even though there is a mouse in tty7 (though that is an unrelated problem). The device is an i386 intel atom netbook running lubuntu (newest version I believe), just one partition for only one OS. It gives long strings of incomprehensible (long and meaningless, not garbage though, actual errors, just extreme panic) error messages when I try to log in, and when I was logged in entered any command. As a result, I could not use ls, cd or so on to get an idea of where precisely it was broken, or reset tty7 to stop aforementioned unrelated problem to try in GUI. When I was logged into tty7, and tried to do anything, it gave error messages about not having a path, just like when I entered commands in terminal tty's.</p>

<p>I know why this happened, though. Due to extreme stupidity, and lack of experience, whilst I was using dd to update, and get working, the live usb version of lubuntu on a usb, (8GB, one partition), I sent it to sda (harddrive) not SDB(usb). I was root. It gave up halfway through. Essentially, I believe I have just partly overidden the hard drive with a live usb lubuntu, and stopped midway through so as it became too broken to run commands anymore.</p>

<p>It is not totally broken, though. It seems capable of giving panicky messages, and displaying the GUI screen. It is only attempts at actually doing anything that fail, for example, accessing log out and shut down options on the GUI. I could not shut down neatly (not without holding down power button), so have not yet decided to, on the grounds I probably won't be able to load it again anyway.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this is an expendable computer, given to me to basically experiment with and break. I've already broken it once or twice, once by catting the hard drive. This time, however, there are some c++ folders in /home/matthew with files I'd rather not use. Is there any way to recover them (the live usb still does not work, but we could get it working using another device)</p>

<p>Sorry about the long (and stupid) question, and losing the files wouldn't be the end of the world. Nevertheless, important lessons about not using root, checking code before running, backing up important files and recording errors aside, is there a way to get my code files back?</p>

The <em>Pause notifications until Firefox restarts</em> does not stop these pop-ups from appearing, it just mutes notifications that you have previously allowed.  And clicking ""Learn more"" tells me about the notifications and how to add them to my own website, but not how to disable them in Firefox.</p>

<p>I have <a href=""http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rEFInd boot manager</a> installed to my EFI System Partition as <code>EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi</code> with a <a href=""https://hastebin.com/efewaxuces"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">simple, nearly default config</a> that allows me to choose Arch Linux or MacOS on boot. Awesome!</p>

<p>Arch Linux is loaded via EFI stub and I have the ability to hibernate and resume to it by using a swap file and kernel parameter <code>resume=...</code>. I can even hibernate Arch Linux, turn on the computer, choose MacOS through rEFInd (or even through the built in boot manager by holding the option key), which boots MacOS, and I can later shut down MacOS and resume Arch Linux from hibernate by selecting it in rEFInd at the next boot.</p>

<p>What I would love is to be able to do the same thing with my MacOS side, that is, hibernate MacOS, boot Arch Linux, to later resume MacOS. However it seems that when I sleep my MacOS side to hibernate (see <code>man pmset</code> for how to tell MacOS to hibernate), when I turn the power on, the resume process bypasses any boot selection I can make! That is, holding <code>option</code> doesn't bring up the boot manager, and it begins MacOS resume right away.</p>

<p>I have tried ensuring that my EFI System Partition is the first choice of the boot manager by holding <code>control</code> and clicking the EFI System Partition at startup (after holding option to get into the boot manager), but this has no effect.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/bootcoup.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> seems relevant, but doesn't explicitly discuss what you can do with how MacOS bypasses the boot manager on hibernation resume.</p>

<p>Could you recommend me the two types that I can do an experiment on and produce clear results that I can derive a conclusion on? Currently planning to compare either 'MP3 or OGG', or 'MP3 or AAC' codec, but not sure which can make the best comparison.</p>

<p>According to Multicommander, the average speed is 304 KB/s which seems incredibly slow to me and is taking literally days to transfer the 54 GB required. It seems like the small files are the problem because most of the time the transfer speed is listed as 4 or 8 KB/s which is INSANELY slow. I think the speed just increases exponentially when a larger file is transferred. So, if this is indeed the problem, a 4 KB/s speed on small files, what could be causing this?</p>

<p>i can't find the corresponding service in the list of services, and i suspect it's the reasonthat trustedinstaller is being invoked after everytime i clean my pc and somehow without even internet access, two viral processes ""winsrv.exe"" and ""winxsrv.exe"" are recreated in my windows folder... </p>

The problem is, for this particular file, i'm not even able to take ownership of it.
Everything is access denied, from copying it, renaming it, deleting it of course... as well as trying to view permissions or change permission to the extent of not being able to take ownership.</p>

"1437946","In the quest for the perfect file naming scheme: spaces, dash and underscores","<p>I am trying to define a robust file naming scheme to be used across the systems I am using. I work in university labs and I deal with all the three major OS: linux, macos, windows. Therefore I'd like to stick on something that can be easily used for all major OS.</p>

<p>Currently my file/folder naming rule is very simple: </p>

<ol>
<li>only use lower case letters from the English alphabet, and numbers</li>
<li>no spaces, use underscores (_) as separator</li>
<li>anything else is forbidden </li>
</ol>

<p>Although this is simple and works across systems, it is too restrictive. </p>

<p>For example many modern search file/folders tools having spaces within file names maybe convenient. In fact most of these tools if I search for ""XXX YYY"", the tool will look for all those files/folders having these two sequences in the file name. This is not the case without spaces. </p>

<p>Another example is music album. Most software have naming scheme like 
""Artist - AlbumTitle"",   ""Artist - Year - AlbumTitle"", etc.</p>

<p>My question are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>how dangerous are spaces in file/folder names? I was educated that to ensure good and easy maintainable system, it's better to avoid spaces. Is this really the case?</p></li>
<li><p>I have been always told that another good rule is to avoid dashes (-). But I realized that in the linux world for example, dashes are used all over the system. And for instance the ISO standard date is something like ""2019-05-17"".</p></li>
</ol>

"1602535","Is there any way to access registry of a Windows back up?","<p>The day before yesterday my hard drive has died (MBR could not be read; all attempts to recover it proved to be futile).</p>
<p>All right, I was smart enough to back up all my data regularly (that included even system partition, just in case), so I did not loose any thing. So far so good.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that I may have lost. I am talking about tabs opened in Chrome (I belong to category of people who like to have a lot of tabs opened).</p>
<p>It looks like there is a way to recover the tabs (the whole profile, actually, but I care about tabs only). It is described <a href=""https://workconsultants.com/blog/move-google-chrome-profiles-to-a-new-computer/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. It requires exporting/importing a specific registry key, though (copying the «User data» directory is not enough, I have tried).

<p>When I create a link between 2 sheets in separate workbooks they break after saving. </p>

<p>Is there a work around for this? It seems like there is a problem with it. </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Extra info:</p>

<p>Here is the original path:</p>

<p>='[NEW! Crew Utilization Hours (2019).xlsm]Chart Info'!$C$114</p>

<p>and here is the path after saving the file and re-openning:</p>

<p>='https://******.sharepoint.com/Users/*****/******/******** - *******/[NEW! Crew Utilization Hours (2019).xlsm]Chart Info'!$C$114</p>

<p>(note the *** are removed possible sensitive information)</p>

<p>The path restructures itself, not in it's self an issue for me....if it worked! That's the problem, whenever I re-open after saving the links no longer update etc etc and Excel fires warnings off at me to that point.</p>

<p>Also this is Excel 2016 that I am working with.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I have been playing around with 2 seperate workbook test files, contained in seperate folders on the same OneDrive.</p>

<p>In the test files I have noticed that the problem does not happen when a different 'Path' is used for example:</p>

<p>=SERIES(,'https://****.sharepoint.com/sites/*********/Shared Documents/******/MANAGER/Test 1/[Test 1.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$3:$C$3,'https://*****.sharepoint.com/sites/*****/Shared Documents/******/MANAGER/Test 1/[Test 1.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$6:$C$6,3)</p>

<p>That path works! no errors and no cant update.</p>

<p>However I don't seem to have any control over how that path is created as opposed to the other non working path, sometimes the first path is created by excel and sometimes it is this type created which works, or is it something I am unwittingly doing?</p>

"1441844","Detect Near-Duplicate Audio Files","<p>Suppose I have a few directories of somewhere around 4000 audio files, about half of which are FLAC and the other half are MP3.  Suppose I want to detect, not by tag metadata, but only by audio data, if I have any duplicate or near-duplicate audio files.  For example, suppose I have both a FLAC (lossless) and MP3 (lossy) version of the same song.  Making no assumptions about the file name, tag metadata, or even sample rate, I would like some way to detect if they are essentially the same tune.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things I have thought of, but they all have some kinds of problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't compare file hashes or file sizes because the underlying audio format or tags might be different</li>
<li>Can't compare the audio files' lengths since near-duplicates may not last for the exact same amount of time (they may be off from each other by very small fractions of  a second), and also because there could be other audio files of the same length</li>
<li>Can't compare the raw audio data sample by sample since that wouldn't be able to detect a lossy and lossless version of the same track</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm really not sure how to do this, or if there is any program that can do this.  Essentially, I'm looking for something like AntiDupl.NET, but for audio files instead of images.  Perhaps this can be done in Python with some kind of statistical analysis, using error as a threshold, but I'm not sure how that could be implemented.  Any program suggestions or other ideas?</p>

I live in North East Thailand. I do have 4 UPS units from &quot;Etech EGO&quot; (1000 VA 500 Watt). I have 3 phase electricity which wil give me 240 to 250 Volt on different phases. Therefore I use an AVR for some equipment in the living room and connect on that group from the AVR the UPS units. Everything works as it should, but if I connect a UPS in another room without a stabilizer than I will see 235 to 240 Volt on the display and it will drop from time to time to around the 220 Volt also if I connect a separate meter it gives the same value.
I do not like the fact that it fluctuate that much, which is in my opinion not good for the connected equipment. I have my thoughts about the UPS units.

<li>I'm using Google Chrome as my default browser. Since Chrome manages it's own processes for each new tab, I can't get any meaningful information from the tab process parent PID.
<br/>
(I think this is what most or all modern browsers do)</li>
<li>Using <code>procexp.exe</code>, I've searched for parts of the URL in the memory strings of anything that might have something to do with it, but to no avail.</li>
<li>I have found some similar questions online, but nothing that has gotten me closer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing I can think of is, that it might have something to do with <code>KMSpico</code>, which I have installed.

I can check in Resource Monitor and those files and that program are not mentioned there. I tried using the Unlocker utility and it still can't delete it.</p>

<p>This is 2019, Windows 10, I am tired of this nonsense. If Windows says it can't delete a file it should provide an option to terminate whatever process is supposedly using the file, and then it will try to terminate and realize it was being silly and get over it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.ibb.co/HnVyscF/Firmware.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Firmware</a></p>
<p>So &quot;on paper&quot;, everything seems to look great. However, when I'm trying to move files from my HDD to the SSD, I'm only getting about 50-70 MB/s. I assumed that the bottleneck here is the speed limit of the HDD read access...</p>
<p>What I don't understand is <strong>why this bogs down my whole system</strong>. I would expect Windows 7 to be smart enough not to allow itself freeze up during simple file transfer operations. Also, the PC has 32 GB RAM and a 3,4 GHz 12-core CPU, so it's not exactly slow.</p>
<p>What might be the problem here? The system gets so slow that I cannot even open Firefox while moving files. Shouldn't the system somehow manage the amount of resources processes can take and put a cap on it in order to ensure stability? Is there some setting that I could change to address the issue?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have little to no experience managing Windows systems. I know that in Linux one can impose custom limits on the resource usage of individual processes. However, file I/O seems something rather fundamental so I'd expect this to be efficiently managed by the OS.</p>
<p>Please help, the setup is not usable in this state...</p>
<p>PS.: I don't want to migrate the system to the SSD as I don't trust Windows with my data. The data should be stored on a separate drive, which is why I got the SSD in the first place. But this should not slow down my system on the HDD.</p>

"1307469","Reinstalling Win10 to different hard drive - How do I activate?","<p>After letting my PC get old for 7 years, I'm thinking about upgrading and moving to an SSD drive. I'm concerned about re-installing Windows 10 though. Back in the day it used to be simple: You went to your PC settings, checked the activation code, reinstalled Windows and were all set. This time it's different for me.</p>

<p>I moved from a Windows 8 (activated with an oldschool activation code) to Windows 10 when it was a free upgrade. However, now I can't see the activation code under settings, as it says ""Windows is activated with a digital licence linked to you Microsoft account"".</p>

<p>So, how does a new install work in this case? I buy a new SSD, burn myself a Win10 installer disc and then what? Will my original Win8 activation code work? Or will I have to log in and Windows will fetch the license info from online? Or will it mess around with my for installing Win10 twice (although I think the licence is tied to the motherboard, not sure)? I'm pretty sure I can figure it out once I get there, just want to be a bit more informed before I start installing stuff.</p>

<p>It seems like they are identical for the first 25 MB, then they are different for 60 bytes and then the same again until the end (they are each 32.9 MiB long, according to Dolphin). How can this be? I was wondering if this is just the result of some quirk in the MP4 standard that specifies some sort of data structure here that holds data specific to the individual files, or there are actual differences between these videos. I have other MP4s that display a similar strange behavior. So I was wondering if there is a tool that can be used to compare these videos frame by frame to reveal whether these differences a few bytes long give rise to actual differences in the content of the videos. Is there such a tool?</p>

"1308454","Meltdown and Spectre: practical advantages and disadvantages for users? (security and performances)","<p>I was guessing which could be the practical downsides of the patches for these risks and also if a user decides to not apply these patches.</p>

<p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p>

<p>In the middle of January I bought a refurbished HP laptop, provided with an Intel i5-3320M (Ivy Bridge), which I upgraded with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM and a Samsung SSD 850 EVO; the OS is Windows 7 Ultimate 64 BIT; since the first day I obviously installed all the recommended patches from Microsoft, and I think that there was also already available the patch against Meltdown, which is activate by a pair of registry keys: <code>FeatureSettingsOverrideMask</code> and <code>FeatureSettingsOverride</code> as reported here <a href=""https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/fd9f2f4f-2534-4d61-86cd-fa5f38ac1557/meltdown-and-spectre-must-registry-value-featuresettingsoverride-manually-set-after-patch?forum=winserver8gen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/fd9f2f4f-2534-4d61-86cd-fa5f38ac1557/meltdown-and-spectre-must-registry-value-featuresettingsoverride-manually-set-after-patch?forum=winserver8gen</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/c05869091"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Furthermore also HP released a patch</a>, against Spectre, which consists in a BIOS update for the microcode of the processor.
For now I had only enabled the patch against Meltdown. I tried to disable the Meltdown patch, and I clearly see an improvement in the general responsiveness of the laptop, is not an exaggerated improvement, but is evidently noticeable: I could say that I could live with this patch enabled, but i fear that if I will also install the BIOS patch, I would see a more evident decay of the general performance of my laptop, also in terms of battery life. Furthermore the patch from Microsoft is easy to disable, but if I update the BIOS, HP seems to state that is not possible to revert to an old BIOS revision.</p>

<p><strong>The questions:</strong></p>

<p>I read that both Spectre and Meltdown must be transmitted with malware software, also through a webpage’s javascript, so: Is not an updated and good antivirus/antimalware enough against these risks? And what about a browser addons like ublock origin and noscript?
I think that the usual rules apply: ""stay away from malicious websites and software"", or is not enough?</p>

<p>By installing/enabling both patches, in which exactly terms these will impact the performances?
I heard something about general troubles here:
<a href=""https://newsroom.intel.com/news/root-cause-of-reboot-issue-identified-updated-guidance-for-customers-and-partners/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://newsroom.intel.com/news/root-cause-of-reboot-issue-identified-updated-guidance-for-customers-and-partners/</a>
I mean: the slowness, which part of the hardware/software will bite? The speed of ram? Will make heavy the load on the processor? Is kernel related? Could impact the battery life?</p>

<p>And the last important question: what we could  expect for the future?

"1308682","What are network ports internally?","<p>I know there will be multiple ports in the host/computing machine for each of the services that i hosts on the network.</p>

<p>But i want to understand what are these ports internally?</p>

<p>Below is my understanding of network ports. Correct me if i am wrong. Add details to make it more clear.</p>

<p>They might be a software construct, mostly a queue/buffer inside the networking component of OS, created dynamically whenever a network service (Web service, file transfer service, etc.) is hosted on the machine. And each of the network service would be listening to their respectively port (to receive the data) and also has access to write it that port (to send the data). [Just like a bounded buffer problem]</p>

<p><em>When data needs to be sent-</em><br>
The network service (Application) would make a system call to OS (say, send()) to write the data onto the buffer and inform the transport protocol. So that the TCP/UDP protocol would take the data from the buffer and segment it and pass it down the network stack.</p>

<p><em>When data needs to be received</em>-<br>
As the data arrives to the host through the NIC, data would be read from some low level network component in the OS and passed up the network stack. And when the transport layer component of OS reads it, it puts the data on the queue associated with that particular port no. so that the application (network service) listening to that port can read the data.</p>

<p>My laptop is Asus Zephyrus gx501vik , it has four USB3.0 ports and one thunderbolt 3 port ( I assume its thunderbolt because of the thunder symbol next to it ).</p>

<p>My main usage is gaming and now also streaming sooo.... 4 ports is definitely not enough.... I found this usb hub in Amazon and it seems to have some decent reviews ( I hope it's fine to post amazon links here - if not then its Anker 10 port 60w usb hub ) : <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00VDVCQ84"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00VDVCQ84/ref=ox_sc_act_image_8?smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;psc=1</a></p>

<p>if you have anything better I would love to know!</p>

<p>these are the devices I'm planning on plugging in (not specifically to the hub, but overall to the laptop):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>usb ethernet adapter ( to connect directly )</p></li>
<li><p>logitech g900 mouse wireless receiver</p></li>
<li><p>steelseries arctis 7 wireless receiver</p></li>
<li><p>focusrite scarlett solo audio interface</p></li>
<li><p>logitech c930e web camera</p></li>
<li><p>razer huntsman elite keyboard</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I also need 3 ports for power only to recharge my headphones/mouse when needed and connect my cooling (cooler master sf-17), but that's less of the problem here.</p>

<p>the usb hub is powered but I'm still afraid about the actual performance, from what I know a USB3.0 port can provide up to 5GBps ( unsure if that's still true in  a laptop, correct me if I'm wrong ) but I am unaware of how much each of those devices will require and will the devices even perform correctly or with a massive delay ( wouldn't want a weird delay for my web cam or audio interface while streaming, or even worst to my keyboard or mouse ).</p>

<p>I have to note that I currently only own the mouse and the headphones, I'm planning on buying the others once I fix my port problem. so let me know if anything else might pose a problem ( or generally a bad idea to buy or connect to a USB hub )</p>

"1447391","What happens on Windows 7/8/10 apx. 30 min after start?","<p>I'v got a curious problem:
On a computer there is only one program running. It acqires camera pictures at a rate of about 20 fps (externally triggered) and saves them as an MJPEG video.</p>

<p>While this works fine most of the time there is one exception:</p>

<p>Every day about 30 minutes after the computer gets turned on something happens that makes the program drop several frames (between 5 and 100, probably related to the current frame rate).</p>

<p>Once that error has occurred once, it works fine again for the rest of the day until it gets shut down in the evening.</p>

<p>The next morning, about 30 minutes after the computer gets turned on, the event occurs again.</p>

<p>It's not related to the time of day but seems to be related to the uptime. If the computer gets turned on later, the event still occurs 30 minutes after that.</p>

<p>This started to happen when we updated the computer (there are actually several of these computers and it happens on all of them) from Windows XP to Windows 7, 8 (8.1) or 10.</p>

<p>I have disabled every service and maintenance task I could think of, but the problem still occurs.</p>

<p>So far, I tried without luck to find anything in the system logs or the performance monitor.</p>

<p>Any idea what the cause could be?</p>

"1309504","Full reinstall of Windows 10 that came with laptop?","<p>I have a Lenovo IdeaPad laptop that came with Windows 10.</p>

<p>It has 4 Gb RAM, which was plenty just a few years ago. But on this machine Windows 10 was pretty slow to start with. Adding a 16Gb flash drive dedicated to ReadyBoost helped matters somewhat.</p>

<p>But now, after half a year of use, it became very slow even with ReadyBoost - so slow even YouTube videos can stutter. I did install Avast which does not detect anything, so I don't think it's malware. It is probably the usual ""Windows rot"", which I am familiar with since Windows 9x and which requires a fresh reinstall. Yes, half a year is a bit too soon - Windows tended to last over a year until it rotted like that. Perhaps it's those huge updates...</p>

<p>Anyway - HOW can I do that fresh reinstall thing if no installation media came with the device?</p>

<p>An alternative would be installing Windows 7 and I even have some OEM packs, but I'm not sure I can find Windows 7 drivers for everything on the machine, including the touch screen, etc. Also, I wonder if Windows 7 will keep working in ""tablet mode"" which this thing has.</p>

<p>(Another alternative is Linux and it is seriously being considered but I am asking here so I can look at WIndows options. Also not sure about ""tablet mode"" on Linux).</p>

"1309659","Windows 10 not really ""shutting down""?","<p>I've been experiencing a rather unusual problem lately. Sometimes I leave the computer on for a number of days before shutting it down if I don't plan to use it again within the next 8 hours. So it's usually on during the weekend and shutdown during the workday.</p>

<p>This past Thursday (2 days ago) I booted it up. The PC has a BIOS password that must be entered before Windows loads. Friday evening, the computer crashed, and as this is an old PC, that is not unusual in and of itself. Usually the entire display just freezes up and I can usually tell in the seconds leading up to the freeze that it will. This time, the video card just appeared to die all of a sudden, and the monitor stopped getting input from the computer. Usually I pull the plug to restart but this time the PC after a few minutes shut off by itself. I pressed the power button and it proceeded to the BIOS password screen, indicating yes it had shutoff.</p>

<p>I yanked the power again then and didn't actually boot up the PC until just this afternoon. And I could not have been more surprised. After the BIOS screen, Windows resumed as my session had been before it crashed! This has not happened before! Usually, all my work is lost. This time, all the Word documents that had been open were still open, and even the video open in my incognito Chrome window was still open to where it had been!</p>

<p>I am very upset about this, as if a computer loses power, there is no way a session should be restored. I believe the time the PC last crashed before yesterday was Wednesday, the day before I booted it up on Thursday.</p>

<p>It almost seems like the computer hibernated, yet the computer crashed.</p>

<p>I went and looked at the system uptime and found something even stranger. According to Windows, as of right now, the computer was last turned on this past Sunday, March 25th (today is Saturday the 31st). Yet, I shut the computer down normally on Tuesday, and it crashed ""normally"" on Wednesday and then crashed again on Friday in a way that all my windows reappeared completely undisturbed when I booted the PC up again today.</p>

<p>Hibernate and sleep are disabled, so I am not sure why this could occur.</p>

<p>Is there any way to prevent this from happening again? I would like to be certain that if the computer crashes, my work IS lost and my previous session does not suddenly get restored. I am not comfortable with Windows being able to restore my session after it has crashed unexpectantly, especially if I cut power. This is a major security hazard.</p>

<p>Further, could anyone explain how and why Windows thinks the computer has been on since Sunday, when it has been shutdown or crashed at least three times during the week? How can I ensure that when Windows shuts down, it is <em>really</em> shutting down and not performing some pseudoshutdown as evidenced by Task Manager and Command Prompt?</p>

<p>I'm trying to get an old video game (PacMan World 3, released in 2005) to run on Windows Xp in my VirtualBox (the host computer is Windows 8.1), but because the game has SecuRom Copy Protection the game won't work unless it has internet access. Since XP is so outdated and vulnerable to viruses and worms, I'm afraid of getting my VirtualBox infected with malware if I open it to the internet. Also, aren't there some worms out there that can affect the host computer? The problem could go beyond my VirtualBox, and I don't want to risk anything to my Windows 8.1 host machine.</p>

<p>Also, it might be important to mention that I won't be using this internet connection to do anything more than play the game, and possibly install updates to Windows.</p>

<p>I've looked into Virtualization and set up a virtual Windows machine within Fedora but someone recently suggested I look into Sandboxing Linux within Windows instead.</p>

<p>I've had a quick search around but everything I've found has been in reference to sandboxing Windows within Linux. So my questions are;</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the security differences</li>
<li>How much would Windows be able to compromise the Linux Sandbox if at all</li>
<li>Which set up would be the most simplistic to set up</li>
<li>Performance differences</li>
</ul>

<p>It's my understanding so far that the Windows host would have zero control over anything belonging to the Linux OS if sandboxed properly but I find it hard to believe Windows itself wouldn't be able to gain access to anything within the sandbox, the other way around sure but not that way. </p>

<p>I'm also under the impression that I'd simply passthrough the hardware the same way as with a virtual machine, is that correct and therefore the only performance difference would be in Windows hogging resources, which wouldn't make a difference in reality as the windows machine is the one that will need the performance anway?</p>

<p>How would Windows be prevented from reading data from within the sandbox, either active or at rest or inputs being sent to the Linux OS for example?</p>

<hr>

<p>Any links that would help further my understanding here would be massively appreciated. I'm going to continue reading up on this topic anyway but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my time on something that wouldn't work anyway.</p>

"1609509","Windows 10 screen garbage, do not know what else to try","<p>I have a the following problem with my laptop. Suddenly, one morning I went to start it and when it gets to the logon screen, the screen just shows random horizontal lines, totally indecipherable. But I can still log in, and shut it down, by just using key combinations, I assumed it was a hardware problem, but wait...
... I can still see the BIOS screen fine, I can still get to recovery mode, that is also fine. I even can boot into a recovery USB (Hirens), screen still totally fine. So I assume now it is not a hardware problem now but windows. I tried with an external monitor, no change.</p>
<p>Tried rolling back windows to earlier version, but only managed to uninstall last &quot;quality update&quot; no joy.
Then I tried to reset windows, twice, both times, screen works fine, but then at some point during install it just prints the weird lines on the screen again.
I tried removing one ram stick at a time, either way I still get the same problem when I restart.</p>
<p>Other info:</p>
<ol>
<li>the screen garbage looks like the horizontal lines are out of sync, I can see the mouse moving, but it spread out in tiny lines all over the screen.</li>
<li>Normally I actually only get black screen, the only way to see the garbage is to plug in the external monitor cable, otherwise the laptop screen stays black. Nothing ever shows on the external.</li>
<li>Acer aspire E 15 (E 571 32nu)</li>
</ol>
<p>Next things I am going to try are:
installing ubuntu or similar, if that works then I will stick with that, really I only need this laptop for Teams, VPN and remote desktop. OR
Maybe the windows reset was the wrong method, and it is just reinstalling the same broken/incompatible drivers. Could someone point me in the direction of a how-to, that lets me install earlier version of windows (without losing my licence).</p>

I've noticed there are a few ways to do this. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND (which may well be wrong):</p>

<p>1) there seems to be a systemd-networkd way, which involves modifying a  <code>/etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network</code> file, and then ideally <code>systemd-networkd.service</code> sets up the interfaces at boot.</p>

<p>2) there is the classical <code>ifupdown</code> configuration way, which mainly relies on the <code>/etc/networking/interfaces</code> file for configuration. Then, the networking service <code>networking.service</code> sets up these services at boot.</p>

<p>My questions are 1) am I correct in how they work, 2) should you only have one of these services enabled at any given time, and 3) once everything is setup, are they both compatible with the <code>ip/ifconfig</code> commands, and the <code>ifup</code> and <code>ifdown</code> commands?</p>

# Sample output:

CommitDate: 2018-04-12 T23

    Here is the commit message.
</code></pre>

<p>I would like for this to work:</p>

<pre><code>bash$ git log ""$myformat""    # It should print the same stuff.
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know how to make it happen with just one Bash variable. Here is a working example with TWO variables:</p>

<pre><code># Define the two variables:
bash$ mypref=""--format=fuller""
bash$ mydate=""--date=format:%Y-%m-%d T%H""    # Note: No "" after the colon.

# Now use it:
bash$ git log ""$mypref"" ""$mydate""    # It works.
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is this: How can I possibly make this work with just one Bash variable? Is it possible?</p>

<p><strong>The Main Problem:</strong></p>

<pre><code>git log --format=fuller --date=format:""%Y-%m-%d T%H""
                       |                       ^ This space is inside one argument.
                       |
                       ^ This space separates two arguments.
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to use a normal string variable. I do not want to use an array variable, I do not want to use <code>$'...'</code>, I do not want to use a function, I do not want to use an alias. When the string is immutable, and when it is not at the beginning of the command, it feels like it should be a Bash variable.</p>

<p>I could very easily solve this with a function in a manner that is fairly readable. I could solve it with other Bash tricks in a way that would be horrifying. I want to use a string variable.</p>

"1613712","I need to choose an SSD to suit my motherboard, either M.2 or SATA III","<p>I admit upfront my ignorance of modern PC architecture, I stopped building a few years ago, but I want to add an SSD to my own system, either M.2 card (SAMSUNG 970 EVO 'MZ-V7E1T0BW' NVMe 1TB, or a SATA III drive (Samsung 860EVO 1TB, although Seagate’s ST1000DM010 looks an awful lot cheaper!).</p>
<p>The current basics are:</p>
<p>CPU: QuadCore Intel Core i7-4790K, 4300 MHz</p>
<p>Motherboard: Asus Z97-Pro Gamer(2 PCI, 2 PCI-E x1, 3 PCI-E x16, 1 M.2, 4 DDR3 DIMM)  - manual is <a href=""https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/Z97PRO_GAMER/HelpDesk_Manual/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>DIMM: 2 x DIMM1- Crucial CT102464BD160B.M16 - 8 GB DDR3-1600 DDR3 SDRAM</p>
<p>Graphics: nVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 - (4 GB) - dual slot card</p>
<p>HD: Disk Drive  SanDisk SDSSDXPS480G - (480 GB, SATA-III)</p>
<p>A Wireless Network Adapter takes up PCIEX_1 which is next to the M2 slot. The M.2 slot has screw fitting for maximum 80mm cards.</p>
<p>I only see 2 x SATA 6Gb/s connectors on the ASUS mobo though, one serves my current SSD (boot drive, which I want to keep in place), and one my CD/DVD writer (very rarely used).</p>
<p>So, to keep it simple, am I limited to using the M.2 slot? I don’t want an HDD. I would like SATA III, though, in case my next mobo doesn’t have an M.2 slot (likelihood or that?).</p>
<p>Or would a USB3 SSD be around as fast as both options? I have an unused USB3 terminal on my motherboard and could drop a USB SSD in the case.</p>
<p>I’m happy with my current rig for gaming - Metro Exodus, Cyberpunk 2027, etc. run very smoothly. I’m looking for the same or faster transfer speeds.</p>

Usually, my system was first starting behaving strange, or was even becoming inoperational, then I was doing a full HDD scan, which was reporting a bunch of damaged sectors; so I was simply removing the misbehaving HDD from this laptop or PC, plugging it to another working laptop or PC via USB and copying whatever data could be salvaged... up to now I was always able to recover the vast majority of data from a failing HDD.</p>

<p>But this time, it's another story. My HDD started freaking clicking with no prior warnings in the middle of the work. The system froze and the laptop become unbootable - each time I power my laptop on the HDD starts clicking again. I can still boot my laptop from a Linux LiveUSB; but I cannot access this HDD from there. (by conventional means at least; not sure if there's any wizard way to do so)</p>

<p>I do backup my data - monthly. And...I did the last backup almost a month ago. Loosing a month of work is...well... not nice.</p>

<p>Is there any hope of recovering data from this HDD or should I just accept that this data is lost for good?</p>

<p>EDIT: This is crazy... but it just come to my mind... The HDD started clicking while I was operating Windows... Is it remotely possible that Windows decided to install updates in the background as it usually does - and so it installed some buggy HDD firmware updates - which killed the drive?</p>

"1316467","Python: File download using ftplib hangs forever after file is successfully downloaded","<p>I have been trying to troubleshoot an issue where in when we are downloading a file from ftp/ftps. File gets downloaded successfully but no operation is performed post file download completion. No error has occurred which could give more information about the issue. I tried searching for this on stackoverflow and found this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19692739/python-ftplib-hangs-at-end-of-transfer?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">link</a> which talks about similar problem statement and looks like I am facing similar issue, though I am not sure. Need little more help in resolving the issue.</p>

<p>I tried setting the FTP connection timeout to 60mins but of less help. Prior to this I was using retrbinary() of the ftplib but same issue occurs there. I tried passing different blocksize and windowsize but with that also issue was reproducible.</p>

<p>I am trying to download the file of size ~3GB from AWS EMR cluster. Sample code is written below</p>

<pre><code>def download_ftp(self, ip, port, user_name, password, file_name, target_path):
try:
    os.chdir(target_path)
    ftp = FTP(host=ip)
    ftp.connect(port=int(port), timeout=3000)
    ftp.login(user=user_name, passwd=password)

    if ftp.nlst(file_name) != []:
        dir = os.path.split(file_name)
        ftp.cwd(dir[0])
        for filename in ftp.nlst(file_name):
            sock = ftp.transfercmd('RETR ' + filename)

            def background():
                fhandle = open(filename, 'wb')
                while True:
                    block = sock.recv(1024 * 1024)
                    if not block:
                        break
                    fhandle.write(block)
                sock.close()

            t = threading.Thread(target=background)
            t.start()
            while t.is_alive():
                t.join(60)
                ftp.voidcmd('NOOP')
            logger.info(""File "" + filename + "" fetched successfully"")
        return True
    else:
        logger.error(""File "" + file_name + "" is not present in FTP"")

except Exception, e:
    logger.error(e)
    raise
</code></pre>

<p>Another option suggested in the above mentioned link is to close the connection post downloading small chunk of the file and then restart the connection. Can someone suggest how can this be achieved, not sure how to resume the download from the same point where the file download was stopped last time before closing the connection. Will this method be full proof of downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>I don't know much about FTP server level timeout settings so didn't know what and how it needs to be altered. I basically want to write a generic FTP down-loader which can help in downloading the files from FTP/FTPS.</p>

<p>When I use retrbinary() method of ftplib and set debug level to 2.</p>

<pre><code>ftp.set_debuglevel(2)
</code></pre>

<p>Below logs are getting printed.</p>

<blockquote>

Job excel files are titled ""1376-1"", ""1376-2"", ""1376-2"", with ""1376"" being the job number and ""1"" being the phase. Each individual job will have a series of lots (individual house) that can range from 1 to 10 or even more. There are 3 parts of a job that we track for shipment: EF, DM, HDW. When a lot ships each of these, we input the date under the corresponding column. </p>

"1457620","How do messages recordings for mobile phones work?","<p>When I call my mobile phone from my other phone, and I do not pick it up, I am prompted to leave a message. When I take out the mobile phone's battery, and I call the phone, it does not ring. However, I am still prompted with a message. I can still record that message.</p>

<p>The question is, where am I recording that message to? An hour passes, another one. Finally I decide to put the battery back into the mobile phone and turn it on. When the phone booted up, I am informed that the phone has a new message, and I indeed hear the message that I recorded when that phone was power off. Where did that message come from? I suppose that immediately when the phone turned on, it got that message wirelessly from external source? What external source is this?</p>

<p>Do messages get sent to the phone directly, or do they get sent to some kind of central computer first, and then to the destination phone? If I send a message to a phone that is power down, does the message go to this hypothetical computer and gets stored there? If this is true, then which computer is this and who manages it? The phone service company, or maybe someone else? Can they read and access my messages? If I never turn on that mobile phone again, do the messages stay indefinitely on that computer? And how does the algorithm know where to send the message to?</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote Desktop Connection (windows builtin)</li>

<p>This tool does not allow to specify the number of monitors you want to use. It only allows to use one screen, or all screens. Resizing the display is not possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 10 remote desktop app</li>
</ul>

<p>This tool allows resizing, so it is possible to use two displays as remote, and one local. These two are however not used in fullscreen, resulting in weird resizing and fuzzy images.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote Desktop Manager Free</li>
</ul>

<p>Same issues as Windows 10 remote desktop app, no fullscreen for the specified monitors.</p>

<p>So the question is: does someone know an application which checks all these boxes?</p>

<p>And using VNC Viewer, i will be connecting to a remote server running some *nix flavor of OS. So again there will be multiple windows opened on the remote server. Hence i could see multiple windows inside VNC Viewer itself. Let us call these windows as <strong>v1, v2, v3, v4</strong>.</p>

<p>And in my host OS (win 10), there will be multiple applications running. Hence there will be multiple windows within Windows 10 itself. Let us call these windows as <strong>W1, W2, W3, W4(VNC Viewer)</strong>; where W4, is the VNC Viewer's window</p>

<p>If i want to navigate between <em>W1 and W2</em> or <em>W2 and W3</em>, so issues i could use the keyboard shortcut <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> (the default key combination).</p>

<p>However, if i enter/select into W4, (VNC Viewer window), then <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> would start navigate between <em>v1 and v2</em> or <em>v2 and v3</em> or <em>v3 and v4</em>.</p>

<p>So, we are able to navigate between W* to v* windows (ie from host OS windows to remote OS windows through VNC Viewer). 
<strong>However, we are not able to navigate the other way round, ie from v* to W* (from windows from remote OS to host OS) - without intervention of mouse</strong></p>

<p>So could anyone help me out to get rid of this problem?

Error: Command failed: convert: unable to load module <code>/usr/lib64/ImageMagick-6.7.8/modules-Q16/coders/pdf.la': file not found @ error/module.c/OpenModule/1278.

convert: no images defined `/tmp/resized.png' @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/3046.</p>

<p>Issue:
The AWS Lambda function still works perfectly for *.JPG and *.PNG files. However, for the last 2 weeks (since we've noticed) the above error occurs for *.AI files. I understand *.AI files are treated like PDF due to being Adobe illustrator files, so makes sense why the pdf.la module is required.</p>

It seems like the policy.xml and delegates.xml file need changes. However, is this something which can be implemented when using the shared imagemagick lib on AWS?</p>

<p>Has anyone else had similar issues recently and can offer any suggestions?</p>

<p>Could it be that I now need Ghostscript included as a node_module? If so, how to I incorporate imagemagick with ghostscript (I'm guessing the node.js code will require changes for this implementation)?</p>

The reasoning being that the active cable is only active at one point - the female end of the cable which theoretically would be the same as a passive cable + hub at the end, right?</p>

<p>If the manufacturers of the active cable feel comfortable stretching the 3m specification to 5m then it.. might work? </p>

In the past I've used a few apps but <strong>Teamviewer</strong> (TV) has been the best for my situation, now however I'm finding that it can't be used because it's blocked by my friends browsers!?</p>

<p>Obviously it's difficult because I'm getting this second-hand, checking with Browserling there doesn't appear to be a problem - but the last two times I've tried to get someone to download TV [both are on Win10] then they've said that the <strong>browser gives them a message that the site ""isn't secure"" and so they can't download the client.</strong> </p>

<p>One has Ad-Aware anti-virus and that blocked emails that I sent with the TV quickstart app and/or a link to the same. Facebook even refuses to send a message with a link to Teamviewer.com and bit.ly appeared to provide a work around but failed to link my friend to the website (worked for me, not for them, don't know which app is blocking that).</p>

<p>So ... <strong>is there anything I can do to set up an ad-hoc support session?</strong></p>

<p>They're not up to doing things like finding an IP address for me, at least not without it being like wading through treacle carrying a two year old, and certainly won't be able to check ports are open and such. <strong>I'm on an Ubuntu variant and they are on Windows 10</strong>.</p>

<p>When I next have access then I'll patch something together with either tightvnc or Teamviewer, but the whole point is remote support and minimising me driving around the countryside just to find the right box to type a password in or whatever needs doing this time.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

"1323424","Force process and kernel module to one core exclusively","<p>I'm just in the phase of evaluating new possibilities, so this question may be a bit strange. I have a Quad-Core CPU which has to do some realtime tasks (it has access to some GPIOs, so this is definitely possible). Instead of using a Realtime Linux (which is more a soft realtime), I want to implement a hard realtime application. So my idea is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>on bootup force all components of the operating system to two of the CPUs cores</li>
<li>load one kernel module which uses the third core exclusively and therefore can do some nasty things like bit-banging the GPOs in realtime</li>
<li>later start one process which uses the remaining core and sends data to the kernel module</li>
</ul>

<p>My questions: is it possible to configure a Linux Kernel/System in this way? If yes: how can I ensure two cores are left unused and how can I put a kernel module and a process to them?</p>

<p>Every idea and hint is welcome :-)</p>

I know that it is done on values in registers, on logic ""AND"" gates etc. but my question is how does computer know how this number (12345678) representation looks in binary?
For example for my microcontroller it takes 1 clock cycle (135ns) to input value (8 bits) to a register and the same amount of time to add R1 to R2. So how is it possible that it is done so quickly? Converting inputted decimal number to its binary form and storing in register in 1 clock cycle.</p>

<p>Also if CPU uses IEEE 754 notation it has to do much more operations.

"1324072","Switching to a new HDD","<p>My laptop came with Windows 7, probably 6+ years ago. Since then I did the free upgrade to Windows 10. However, the current HDD has a SMART Drive Error. Which, honestly, doesn't seem to affect it at all except for it reminding me every time I boot it up. I haven't been saving anything important on there in case it does blow, though. </p>

<p>Today, I bought a new HDD for it which is completely blank (no bootable device -- insert boot disk). I don't really care about any of the files on the old HDD, just the operating system. Unfortunately, I need a disk to boot from to install an OS onto the new HDD. I have no Windows 10 disks, and have long lost the Windows 7 disks (if it even came with any). It seems Microsoft has discontinued their free upgrade program, so I can't find an ISO of 10 anywhere.</p>

<p>I've searched for tools that can migrate the bad disk over to the good one, but all the ones I have found require both disks being connected at the same time. My laptop only supports connecting a single HDD.</p>

<p>I have a 32gb flash drive I bought to put the ISO on and boot from, but that's hard to do without an ISO.</p>

<p>I've seen some comments various places talking about creating system restores/image backups, but I'm not sure how any of that works and can't seem to find a simplistic guide in doing so that enables me to boot and install an OS.</p>

<p>What are my options here? I don't care about files from the old HDD. All I want is to install Windows 10 on my new HDD, preferably without paying for what I already had.</p>

"1464430","Why do web development frameworks and tutorials for them never show how to do temporal data?","<p>I would like to create my own payroll engine as a website. In Oracle ERP applications it is a very common thing to have a start and an end date on tables, so that you can have varying values over time. The start and end date would also form the primary key of the table along with an id.</p>

<p>This allows for temporal changes (changes over time). Additional validation is normally also needed to prevent time overlaps. Another issue is that you could also query at a time where no data exists at that time range, and then you might want to jump to the nearest or last existing time range.</p>

<p>In Oracle's latest database release temporal validity has finally become a thing, see <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/db/12c/r1/ilm/temporal/temporal.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a>; but it still hasn't made it's way to for example Oracle APEX.</p>

<p>Surely specifying the time at which you want the value should be something that a lot of people would want, especially for salary over time, address, etc.</p>

<p>Why do web development frameworks (specifically Python Flask with SQL Alchemy and Postgresql) and tutorials for them never show how to do temporal data such as this or am I missing stuff that readily exists?

This is after following general recommendations for increasing performance on MySQL, including using mysqltuner and following its directions.</p>

<p>I am currently using my personal computer to parse Wiktionary, the specs of which are 4.2 Ghz CPU and 8G ram, using a 1TB HDD. Very naively calculated, I imagine a 256G RAM server would then be able to parse Wiktionary in about a day. I <em>think</em> I need to rent a server high in RAM, average in CPU, and minimal in HDD space, at a per second rate for a day or two. <strong>However, I'm not sure whether that would even work</strong> (would scaling up memory by 30x really help?), or where to find such a thing, or what to even google to start.</p>

<p>Some more details: Wikokit works by taking a raw, unparsed SQL database of Wiktionary, parsing it through its Java code using <a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Connector/J</a>, then loading it into a formatted SQL database that starts off empty. Essentially raw_enwikt -> wikt_parser.java -> parsed_enwikt. The guide can be found <a href=""https://github.com/componavt/wikokit/wiki/Setup-NetBeans-for-parsing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not very experienced in server usage, so I am also unsure of whether you would be able to set up MySQL and run Java code on it on any arbitrary server. I need the parsed database in relatively short time, within the next 3-4 days.</p>

<p>I like to write and give away that content. But what happens is that someone, typically from outside the US, will copy my writing and then actually publish it as their own, even making e-books and selling them. Yep, outright plagiarism theft. But it's improbable to catch them, or do anything about it even if you know exactly who it is/was. I have the following choices: forget posting anything on any web-page, and just publish it all via e-books (and POD paper), which means people would have to pay to read (Amazon and others will not give away anything; I've checked already). Or, continue to get robbed. Or, and what I'm hoping to do: Find a CSS (or ??) way to offer it free to read online, but impossible to copy or otherwise steal. Now of course, I've done the CSS/HTML: </p>

<p>Body {-webkit-user-select: none; -khtml-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; -o-user-select: none; user-select: none; } (CSS)</p>

<p>body oncontextmenu='return false;' onkeydown='return false;' onmousedown='return false;' (HTML)</p>

<p>But with Firefox &amp; other browsers with the Reader View function, it's easy to circumvent that and easily copy the content anyway. Must I stop publishing for free online? I know, everyone thinks everything online should be free: That's what I'm doing! Don't need that lecture, just tech advise if there is any, to prevent the plagiarism &amp; theft. Thanx!</p>

We work in video production, and as such we're quite often updating software, plugins, installing scripts into the Adobe programs etc.</p>

<p>I'm hoping there's an easier/quicker way to do this, while still keeping them as standard users? </p>

If I add a permission rule giving ""All application packages"" full control of the WindowsApps folder and subfolders, then Windows Store begins functioning again, but this seems like a band-aid fix so I tried to find another solution.

Now, I had searched around for the solution a long time ago, but I dropped it and came back now. I found out that this happens due to ""legal reasons"", but I haven't actually read anything that proves it... I have read that on Intel's FAQ, but not the actual legal papers. The part that I find the most stupid is that it can't be due to possible interference with government stuff, because there are plenty of 5Ghz routers around where I live, which should be even more powerful than my laptop's adapter.

"1332534","Virtualization (VT-X) stopped working on w10 machine. How can I start it again?","<p>I have a Windows 10 Home machine (Lenovo Y520) with a Core i7-7700HQ processor. Windows 10 and the BIOS are up to date. So is Oracle Virtualbox.</p>

<p>Until recently it was running VMs just fine with Oracle Virtualbox (doing what I bought it to do). Then it stopped doing that. VirtualBox's <em>New VM</em> feature stopped offering me 64-bit VMs. The ones I already had in place stopped running.</p>

<p>I have tried the instructions in these answers:</p>

<p><a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/866962/why-does-virtualbox-only-have-32-bit-option-no-64-bit-option-on-windows-7"">Why does virtualbox only have 32-bit option, no 64-bit option on Windows 7?</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1153470/vt-x-is-not-available-but-is-enabled-in-bios"">VT-x is not available, but is enabled in BIOS</a></p>

<p>Specifically, I've tried upating the BIOS, reloading BIOS default settings, turning on Intel Virtualization in the BIOS, rebooting, powering off and back on again, etc etc ad nauseam. W10 Home doesn't have the Microsoft virtualization features that often interferes with VirtualBox, and I've made sure Windows Hypervisor Platform is shut off.</p>

<p>Still, no 64-bit vms.  What next?</p>

"1333050","One processor is working wierdly","<p>My Overall CPU condition is fine, but one of my processors (the first one) seems to be heavily working (and I can feel that from my fan noise and the heat).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/f0p5j.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/f0p5j.png"" alt=""task man""></a></p>

<p>I checked <code>task manager</code> and <code>resource monitor</code> to see which process is taking that much power. Found nothing. I guessed that maybe not all the processes are actually shown in resource monitor so I installed <em>Process Lasso</em> and <em>Process Explorer</em> (both are more or less similar to Windows' <code>resource monitor</code>). Still found nothing. I also set all affinities to 1-7, meaning that all my processes can be start on all my CPUs except the first one. Yet, there is a huge load on my first CPU. 
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/gR6Cg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gR6Cg.png"" alt=""resmon""></a></p>

<p>By some research, I found that it may be the case that my first CPU's clock is somehow set to be really high, which I guess, means more power consumption, more fan speed and more heat (I don't have a concrete knowledge about the clock, so not sure if my guess is really correct). Noting that my <em>Maximum Frequency</em> in <code>resource monitor</code>, is actually suggesting that my CPU (don't indicates which one) is working with nearly 130% of maximum frequency (= boost speed/base speed *100 = 3.6/2.6 *100 = 138 %) or my maximum boost speed frequency to be more precise. So I tried to change my <code>maximum processor state</code> to something considerably less than 100% (say 50) to see If there is any difference in heat and noise. Nothing again even after reboot.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/rhT5j.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/rhT5j.png"" alt=""Power Plan""></a></p>

<p>My system is dual-boot and I don't have that problem in my other OS (Ubuntu 16.04). No noise or heat.</p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is my first CPU really working that much? If so, then how it's possible to have such normal average CPU usage (the average is incredibly close tho the mean of all other CPUs)?</p></li>
<li><p>Why affinity change doesn't made any difference on the CPU usage?</p></li>
<li><p>The CPU usage of all my processes is less than what is actually is being used. Look at resource monitor picture: I have selected all the processes and now the orange line shows the amount of CPU that is taken by them. I checked the same in safe mode. Orange line, exactly coincides the total usage in safe mode. So I'm suspecting that something is happening in my normal boot. What may be the reason and how I can solve it?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My system is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel core i7 - 4720 HQ  2.6 GHz upto 3.6</li>
<li>Windows 10 (64 bit)</li>
<li>NVidia GTX 950 M</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: </p>

<p>This screenshot, shows the <em>Process Lasso</em>'s interface. Those 8 green bars on upper right show my CPU usage. Also the column called <em>Rules</em>, indicates the affinities on the processes. </p>

<pre><code>if 'C:Path/Data/%s' % stat:
                directory = 'C:Path/Data/%s' % stat

<p>I receive this error:</p>

<pre><code>OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument:

By that I mean that I can add files to the directory on my disk and it will be automatically stored on the NAS when it is available (it's an Ubuntu PC connected as a network drive using samba that isn't always available when the PC is on). I don't simply want to sync the directory, I want the NAS to serve as an archive, so that when I delete files on the source they remain indefinitly on the NAS.
I also have directories which I want to simply keep in sync, for that I was thinking I could just use Sync Center.</p>

<p>As an example:
I have a folder of photos locally. I'll never delete anything on it, but in case I do or my disk breaks, I want to have a full backup of everything that has ever touched that folder.
On the other hand I may have a Downloads directory which I want backed up, but if I delete a file it should also be deleted on the network storage when the next sync occurs.</p>

I get them to send me a diagnostic using our tool, which shows the wireless networks in range, and they are sharing a Wi-Fi channel with 5 other nearby radios, some of them showing up to 100% signal strength, according to Windows (which I know is all kinds of flawed, but still indicates a strong signal).</p>

<p>From my point of view, this is clearly the problem. Change your wireless channel.</p>

<p>From their point of view, this can't be the problem, as all of their other devices work just fine. It's just the one problematic device that has the issue connecting.</p>

<p>If I can get them to change their wireless channel to one that isn't used by other radios, then everything is usually fixed. Even then, though, the only explanation I can provide is that wireless interference affects different devices in different ways, which doesn't really cut it with some people.</p>

"1482303","Mysterious missing half the RAM, although windows reports it's usable","<p>My Windows 10 64bit PC has 16GB of physical RAM:</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt;wmic MEMORYCHIP get BankLabel, DeviceLocator, Capacity
BankLabel  Capacity     DeviceLocator
BANK 0     17179869184  ChannelA-DIMM0
</code></pre>

<p>Also under About your PC it says:</p>

<pre><code>Installed RAM 16.0 GB (15.7 GB usable)
</code></pre>

<p>But in Task Manager my memory shows as 83% full. Once in a while some applications get automatically closed because of out of memory issues. So I digged in to check what uses so much RAM. The biggest offender was Firefox with about 800MB of RAM. But that's just not that much. Then I did a tasklist /FO CSV > tasks.csv to sum up all the memory usage, and the result was 6.4GB, which is about 83% out of 7.7GB (assuming that 0.3GB are always reserved for video stuff).</p>

<p>This suggests that even though Windows sees the full 16GB, it only uses 8GB.
Or, it uses 8GB for some secret stuff it doesn't want to show in task manager.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to investigate this further?</p>

To non-destructively display that value under Windows try (lowercase characters optional)</p>

<p>The value is down to 65536 (64kIB) for 1GB to 4GB drives. Under diskpart, the (DESTRUCTIVE) <code>CLEan</code> then <code>CREate PARtition PRImary OFFSET=32</code> is supposed to reduce that to 32kiB, but instead is silently ignored if below the minimum value diskpart wants (1024 or 64 depending on drive). Lower values cause an error.</p>

<p>When partitioning under OS X (Disk Utility) and asking for MBR, one gets the first partition at 1024 (1kiB). That's about 1MiB more usable space (for an 8GB drive). I have not found any drawback.</p>

<pre><code>AAAMap
AABMap
AADMap
AAEMap
AAA.map
AAB.map
AAD.map
AAE.map
</code></pre>

<p>There we have 4 folders and 4 map-files.
First thing to do is to symlink every file into every folder and give them a number, dependong on which relation their INDEX (ascending by name) is to the index of the folder.
So it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>AAAMap
 '- 01_AAA.map
 '- 02_AAB.map
 '- 03_AAD.map
 '- 04_AAE.map
AABMap
 '- 01_AAB.map
 '- 02_AAD.map
 '- 03_AAE.map
 '- 04_AAA.map
AADMap
 '- 01_AAD.map
 '- 02_AAE.map
 '- 03_AAA.map
 '- 04_AAB.map
AAEMap
 '- 01_AAE.map
 '- 02_AAA.map
 '- 03_AAB.map
 '- 04_AAE.map
</code></pre>

<p>If I re-run the script, it should delete all the symlinks and create them completely new. (Except if you find a better solution with just renaming and reordering the files) -> because there could be files added (each file will get their own folder too) which can be at any position of the file index (alphabetical order).</p>

<p>So for example if we simply add <strong>AACMap</strong> folder and <strong>AAC.map</strong> file.
Numbering inside the folders would be different if this file will get added.</p>

<p>I want to block all the outbound external traffic (public internet) but still allow all the internal traffic (from the local net). What I tried is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow outbound connections that do not match a rule.</li>
<li>Added a new rule that matches all programs, services, protocols, <strong>remote IP addresses</strong> and the local IP address 1.1.1.1 (since I have to enter at least one).</li>
</ul>

<p>If instead of matching that IP address I match any address, then the rule effectively blocks everything (including local traffic). But with my approach, the rule stops working and all traffic (including external one) is allowed.</p>

<p>I don't understand why making the rule to match a subset of local IP addresses causes the rule to stop working.</p>

I used the command prompt available in the Windows Installation USB to reformat the drive using DISKPART. By default, the drive was formatted as an MBR partition, which I later learned has been deprecated in favor of GPT. I also learned that I could use Microsoft's MBR2GPT tool to convert the partition to GPT after installation, so I continued the installation using MBR.</p>

<p>After the installation I used the MBR2GPT tool to convert my MBR partition to GPT; however, it failed in creating the WinRE partition. After inspecting my disk using windows computer management utility, it appears that I only have a primary partition and an EFI partition.</p>

<p>In summary, I have the following questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not see a MSR partition using the computer management utility.
Is this a problem?</li>
<li>Do I need the WinRE partition? If it is just for
launching windows in recovery mode, then will a recovery USB suffice?</li>

"1494816","Keyboard Shortcut in ""The Social Network""","<p>In the movie ""The Social Network"" featuring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, there's a scene where Zuckerberg is in a computer lab (presumably working) at a computer when one of his friends approaches him.  He gets an idea for his site and gathers his things to leave.  Before he exits the computer lab, however, the camera (seemingly very purposefully) transitions to a close-up shot of the keyboard at the computer and shows him hitting (what appears to be) the <code>Esc</code> key twice in succession.  It's hard to discern if he's holding any other keys as he does so, but even still, the intent seems pretty clear; he's done using the computer.  Maybe he's locking it or shutting it down.  Perhaps he's just exiting out of a program.</p>

<p>I can't imagine what keyboard shortcut entails hitting <code>Esc</code> twice in a row.  As this movie takes place in the early 2000s, it's possible this is something specific to an older version of Windows or even an old version of a desktop application.</p>

<p>I'm curious as to what might this keyboard shortcut be - assuming it's a legitimate keyboard shortcut at all!  It's possible that this is just some dramatic movie artsiness designed to convey how much of a hurry he is to get back to his dorm and implement the idea.  Maybe the fact that he hit the key twice is unimportant.</p>

"1500750","Disable automatic customising folders in Windows 10","<p>Windows File Explorer has long had a feature whereby it tries to customise folders based on what files are in there.  Is there any way to disable this in Windows 10?</p>

<p>Specifically I have a problem that I create a lot of audio-visual files, and this leads Windows to often re-categorise folders as music - so that File explorer in detail mode displays columns like 'artist' and 'album'. I basically NEVER want this, and I therefore seem to be forever manually changing folders back to 'documents' (by right-clicking in File Explorer and selecting 'Customise').  Frustratingly, Windows invariably then re-categorises the folder back to 'music' as soon as I add a couple more .mp3's to the folder, so I have to manually change it back again.</p>

<p>Hence my question: How can I stop Windows doing this? I don't really want to change things on a per-folder basis (because this problem affects a lot of folders) - I would prefer to just change one setting to stop Windows ever auto-customising any folder anywhere on my file system.</p>

<p>From what I've seen, HSPA was used to accelerate network standards during the 3G era. But the info I'm getting online is conflicting.</p>

<p>Certain articles like <a href=""https://www.rciwirelesscontrol.com/demystifying/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> say it was used on GSM...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2005, the 3G network was launched. This faster technology was the first to support video. <strong>GSM uses UMTS standard and HSPA</strong> (for 3.5G, which is even faster), while CDMA uses EV-DO data service. The main disadvantage of EV-DO is that it is limited to data or voice calls only, never both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while others like <a href=""https://www.dignited.com/36793/gsm-cdma-hspa-and-lte-understanding-mobile-network-technologies/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> say it was used on CDMA...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the HSPA uses 3G standards, it delivers higher data transmissions when compared to the CDMA technologies. <strong>HSPA was primed at improving 3G standards on CDMA communication protocol.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I even find articles like <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/300986/cdma-vs-gsm-whats-the-difference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> even more confusing because first they say that GSM and CDMA were two separate and incompatible technologies...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CDMA and GSM are the two 2G camps that survived. <strong>They remained split during the '00s through the third generation of cellular</strong>, which added better data speeds but stayed incompatible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet the article went on to mention that in 3G, WDCMA counted as the ""3G GSM""??</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since its inception, GSM has evolved faster than CDMA. <strong>WCDMA is considered the 3G version of GSM technology.</strong> (?????) To further speed things up, the 3GPP (the GSM governing body) released extensions called HSPA, which have sped GSM networks up to as fast as 42Mbps, at least in theory.</p>

<p>So which protocol was HSPA for? Could someone clarify?</p>

"1507210","How to stop windows from updating my Intel(R) HD Graphics 630 Driver","<p>My current machine is a Aftershock 65xHP [Intel Core i7-7700HQ]
Running on Intel(R) HD Graphics 630 on a Clevo motherboard. I also have an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 graphics card.</p>

<p>I tried a few versions of Intel(R) HD Graphics 630 drivers and all of them prevent my Laptop LCD screen from working. (I had to connect to an external monitor via HDMI to view my screen)</p>

<p>only 1 version of this graphics driver worked for me.</p>

<p>that is - <strong>25.20.100.6519</strong> - dated 1/9/2019 by Intel [See image - <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0ZNJg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>]</p>

<p>every now and then, windows update will update this driver and <strong>my LCD screen will stop working</strong>. All other solutions such as rolling back a driver will not work if I'm away from an external monitor; isn't the point of owning a laptop being able to work without an external monitor?</p>

<p>Can someone offer a solution to stop this update?</p>

<p>User would load the link, and need to input specific input in that row.</p>

<p>I'm curious if there are extensions, applications, or even faster excel methods to do this, vs. copy from excel, go to input in browser, paste.</p>

<p>Example, test@test.com is excel text, <a href=""https://link1.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://link1.com</a> is link
User loads link, needs to copy/paste in test@test.com in an email box, move on to the next row with new input.</p>

<p>Any way to speed this up with other tools?</p>

<p>I'd like to write a program that generates graphs (for example two AIs playing a game against each other) and streams it on twitch. But I don't want the program to be running on my PC. I want the program to run on a remote machine, for example an EC2 instance on AWS.</p>

<p>I have seen discussions about streaming RTMP but I'm not sure if that's the best/right way of doing what I want to do.</p>

<p>I'd like to know how to do this or what to look for online.</p>

"1508502","Is there such a thing as a ""supervisor"" I can run on a normal x86 PC?","<p>I have a beefy PC. It runs Windows 10 Pro. Windows 10 is a nightmare. Inside of it, I run VMware Workstation 15 Player. Inside that, I run another Windows 10 Enterprise Trial. I use this VM to test sketchy stuff and run any program I don't trust on the host OS.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of minimal ""OS"" I can install which is a ""supervisor"" and just provides the bare bones to run and display a bunch of VMs, so that my current host OS Windows 10 Pro <em>and</em> my Windows 10 Enterprise both become VMs inside this ""supervisor""?</p>

<p>That is, so that they are completely detached from each other and none is the ""master"" or ""host"" OS (the ""supervisor"" is)?</p>

<p>I tried searching for this but found nothing whatsoever. I am aware of Qubes OS, but from my experience, it doesn't even install on most hardware, and it's far from the ""minimal supervisor"" I'm talking about. And it doesn't even seem like a solid or polished one. I have heard that Windows runs like garbage inside of it, if you even get it to run at all.</p>

<p>I expect that each OS inside this ""minimal supervisor"" runs extremely closely to the way it runs when it ""actually runs"".</p>

<p>One major reason I want this, other than the security aspect, is that VMware <em>still</em> doesn't even support DirectX 11, over 10 years after it was released, and seemingly are not in a hurry to implement support for it.</p>

<p>Another major reason is that I cannot physically fit multiple actual computers, nor afford them, and this one should be powerful enough and with enough ram (32 GB) to power multiple serious machines. I want to also run some much more secure OS for my ""mission-critical"" stuff, so that it is entirely separate from my ""private"" computer or my ""test VM"".</p>

<p>I have little hope of this existing, let alone be available for free, let alone be good, but I owe it to myself to at least try to ask.</p>
