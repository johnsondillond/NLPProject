"272414","What's the point of the ""From Review"" link in LQ canned comments?","<p>When reviewers in the Low Quality Posts review queue recommend the deletion of a post, they have the option to leave a canned comment, and many reviewers do indeed leave such comments. The system adds a ""From Review"" link at the end which goes to the review item. Users without the edit privilege (2K on launched sites) are able to see the votes of each reviewer, while those with the privilege can cast their own vote if they have not already done so.</p>

<p>I am concerned that this automatic link may not be desirable behavior, especially for new users. Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clicking the link shows their post under the heading <strong>Low Quality Posts</strong>. It's kind of like a ""ha ha, computer thinks you did bad."" This probably doesn't make users feel too good, especially if the post was fine and one reviewer made a mistake.</li>
<li>Looking at the list of specific users that recommended deletion feels like a ""ho ho, look at all these people that think you did bad."" Note that reviewers appear in this list even if they didn't leave the canned comment.</li>
<li>Users without the first review privilege (500 on launched sites) probably won't have seen the review interface before, and aren't expected to have read up on the review process or the LQP workflow.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, it just doesn't seem that the link needs to be publicly visible.</p>

<p>The only advantage that I can see of the link is that it lets community members with the edit privilege see that the post landed in LQP and that they might want to review it too. Maybe the link should be made a little indicator like the parenthesized number next to <em>close</em> or <em>edit</em>?</p>

"273075","Lower the bar for downvoting on Meta.SE","<h3>User Disenfranchisement</h3>

<p>When a user notices a featured Meta.SE topic in their own site's sidebar that impacts them, and they click through to Meta.SE, a significant number of them, regardless of their expertise in their subject and site, cannot show their disagreement with the change by downvoting because they have not already participated in Meta.SE enough to downvote.</p>

<h3>Evidence</h3>

<p>The results of this user disenfranchisement are clear.  You have announcements with an upvote/downvote record of 594/124 while the highest voted response is negative towards the proposal, and has 629/26 votes.</p>

<p>It is then trivial to assume that because the main post's votes are largely positive, there must be significant support for the proposal, when the reality is that there is significant unhappiness about the proposal, but we've disenfranchised users so they are unable to express it appropriately. Further, we cannot simply assume that the 629 negative cancel out the 594 positive and assume half the people don't like the proposal because it's possible to vote positively for the proposal, then after reading the later discussion changing one's mind and being unable to change their vote on the proposal until someone edits it (they certainly can't edit it!).</p>

<h3>Work-arounds</h3>

<p>While there are some work-arounds, such as hosting discussions on individual metas and trying to bring those responses to the table, as well as upvoting the negative responses in the hopes that people they trust pay attention, this is inadequate.  In such cases people <em>still</em> assert that there is more positive support for such a proposal than negative disapproval.</p>

<h3>Meta is <strike>murder</strike> different</h3>

<p>Meta is actually another Stack Exchange site for experts about Stack Exchange, and so it makes sense to have some bars for participation in terms of how new users can contribute and gain reputation.</p>

<p>As you notice, though, there are things discussed here that have <strong><em>significant, direct impact</em></strong> on other sites.</p>

<p>Further, downvotes on Meta are often used to indicate disagreement - in the same way we originally used Uservoice to prioritize features and express agreement and disagrement. To some degree it's a priority queue, but it's terribly unbalanced if the vast majority of our users can only put positive pressure on change proposals.</p>

<h3>Conclusion and recommendation</h3>

<p>Down-voting should not be tied to the high level of reputation currently required -  <strong>you don't need Meta.SE expertise to evaluate the usefulness of an idea to you or your site</strong>. On a regular site you vote according to truthiness, but <strong>here you vote according to usefulness given your perspective/experience.</strong></p>

<h1>Meta.SE should lower the bar for downvoting, making it equivalent to upvoting.</h1>

<p>Because there is still a 2 rep cost associated with downvoting, this will still be self-limiting, and prevent significant abuse.  Once a person downvotes significantly, they will have to also participate in other ways to continue to downvote.</p>

"274104","Allow moderators to edit the sidebar text on the ask page","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Moderators should be given the ability to edit the sidebar text on /questions/ask.</p>

<hr>

<p>Moderators can edit various documents and texts around their sites that the community can't. The help center's /on-topic page is a good example of this. This is good, because it lets the community make changes to their documentation faster than any other process would allow.</p>

<p>I propose that this functionality be extended to the sidebar on the ask page.</p>

<h3>What's the Problem?</h3>

<p>The 'problem' with the current system isn't so much of a problem as an inefficiency.</p>

<p>To edit that text, the current method is:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a meta post to confirm with the community that they want this to happen, and to get the wording of the text down</li>
<li>go bug a community manager to edit the text for you</li>
<li>wait for the edit to come through</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, while this isn't a <em>massive</em> problem, it <em>does</em> reduce communities' self-sufficiency and efficiency, which can in turn be a problem when sites want to take action on question quality and this turns out to be a holding point.</p>

<p>I've seen a couple of cases recently where sites have had that text edited, which as with many CM requests is unpredictable - without <em>any</em> disrespect to the CM's, they have many tasks on their plates and can't always deal with individual issues like this straight away. It can take a while for things to happen, in some cases.</p>

<h3>What's the Solution?</h3>

<p>The current mod-editing functionality could be extended to cover this text as well. If you haven't figured it out yet, it's this I'm talking about:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/k2LBm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/k2LBm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This would allow mods to edit the text there without having to go through CM requests.</p>

<p>This would solve the issue - moderators are more familiar with their sites, scopes, and communities than the CM's are. This is an advantage because it removes the time taken for a CM to familiarise themselves with a site or issue, then evaluate the proposal, then provide feedback or action.</p>

<p>I have been told of a couple of potential reasons why this shouldn't happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>There's generally no reason to be making rapid changes to that text.</strong><br>
Neither is there a reason to do so in the help center. Mods have access to edit the help center, and that's a very useful feature. I don't <em>think</em> I've heard of any cases of abuse of it?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's something everyone asking sees, and the CM's want to be on top of it.</strong><br>
That is, of course, up to the CM's. However, I believe that currently, when mods edit the help center, the CM's are pinged in some way (email, inbox, I don't know). Perhaps it would be a good idea, if mods were given this access, to extend this ping too? When a mod edits the text, a CM can be pinged about it and review it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other thoughts I had about the implementation of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps it could be rate-limited, so that it <em>can't</em> be edited very frequently. Use a long rolling rate limit - one edit per 24 hours?</li>
<li>Perhaps something similar could be used for edits here as for revision redactions and close reason additions? When a mod edits the text, generate an auto-flag for another mod to review.</li>
</ul>

"274106","Is there some way to see all of a user's messages in a chat room?","<p>Here's the situation: I'm investigating a user's behaviour in a couple of chat rooms because I find the overall patterns concerning, and may need to direct some official attention their way discreetly. They haven't spoken there often, and I suspect a high % of their activity will be of interest.</p>

<p>Is there some way I can find the various instances of someone's activity in a room? Either their messages, or the days on which they have spoken, would be useful.</p>

<p>The best I can think of is to open up the Transcript and search it for very common words, but ""the"" turns up no results, and ""you"" isn't picking up much. I also tried Google (<code>{username} site:chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/{roomnumber}</code>), but that digs up a lot of false positives, and doesn't turn up incidents I <em>know</em> are there (I was there for them).</p>

"274107","Links from historical election pages point to current resources","<p>On election pages, there is a short section with links to additional resources. As an example, here is the relevant part for the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/election/4"">2013 Stack Overflow moderator election</a>:</p>

<p>Apparently, however, the content for that section is shared among all past and present elections for a site. Therefore, the <em>Election chat room</em> and <em>The candidates answer your questions</em> links lead to the relevant pages for the latest election (in the case of Stack Overflow, the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/election/7"">fall 2015 election</a>); the overview linked from <em>More information about the candidates</em> also seems to provide information only about the latest election. The <em>Meta</em> link is, of course, timeless.</p>

<p>This is not limited to Stack Overflow, although some sites appear to omit this section altogether (e.g. <a href=""https://dba.stackexchange.com/election/1"">DBA SE has it</a>, <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/election/2"">Physics SE not</a>).</p>

<p>Ideally, the links should lead to the resources relevant for each election. If this is not possible (or worth the effort), the section shouldn’t be displayed at all.</p>

Now in some cases this may be useful, however not all those who put the word <code>security</code> into their post have also put the <a href=""/questions/tagged/security"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security</a> tag, so then it becomes impossible to search for those posts without that tag, but with that word in them.</p>

<p>So I suggest that there should either be an override such as putting, say <code>---</code> before and after the word like this in the search <code>---security---</code> so that it doesn't treat it as a tag, or if one does not put the word in <code>[]</code> in the search, for it to perhaps suggest those tags, or tell you that in order to search for tags you have to put the <code>[]</code> around each one, but not to actually automatically do it for you and thus prevent you from just searching for the word normally, rather than as a tag.</p>

"275656","Make it possible in 10 K tools to view all migrations to/from a specific site and give a summary","<p>I love the 10K tools. They're a lot of fun to explore.</p>

<p>Recently, I was participating in a discussion on Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy about migrations to Movies &amp; TV. I'm not a big SFF user but I do have 10K tools on M&amp;TV. In order to quantify the numbers of migrations, you can certainly view the list of question in the migration tool view but there doesn't seem to be a way to limit the list to a specific site only. This means that, while you can certainly manually count all of the migrations, you have to avoid counting questions from other sites.</p>

<p>What I am requesting is that you make it possible to limit the ""migrated"" page results to a specific site only. So, if I'm only interested in questions sent to M&amp;TV from SFF, instead of this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FBMPD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FBMPD.png"" alt=""Multiple sites""></a></p>

<p>You would instead see something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/h9hYn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/h9hYn.png"" alt=""SFF only""></a></p>

<p>In addition, it would be super cool if you added a counter that would include stats on this limited page about the history of the migrations. Something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SFF migration stats:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Migrations here: 88</li>
  <li>Migrations away: 21</li>
  <li>Rejected here: 19</li>
  <li>Rejected away: 1</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This would give 10K users a quick overview on how the site's doing with migrations and, if there's a lot of rejected migrations, see what's needing to be fixed. It'd also make discussions like the one on SFF easier as you wouldn't have to manually count all of the migrations.</p>

"276063","Scrolling/content area issues on iOS 8.4","<p>I'm using Safari on an iPhone 6, iOS 8.4 (yes, it's time to upgrade, but then how would we find these fun bugs?).</p>

<p>In the new mobile chat, the bottom part of the content area is often outside the bounds of the device and can't be scrolled to.</p>

<p>This is what I normally see when opening a room list: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/QXRxx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.sstatic.net/QXRxx.png</a>. And this is what happens if I take a screenshot while still touching the screen after scrolling to the bottom of the list: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/s2NoZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.sstatic.net/s2NoZ.png</a>. (The second I let go, the list ""bounces"" back to what you see in the first screenshot.)</p>

<p>Entering a room typically looks like this: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Lbt7v.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.sstatic.net/Lbt7v.png</a>.</p>

<p>So, it appears that this behaviour occurs when Safari is still showing the browser navigation controls. There's no apparent way to dismiss those controls - scrolling or tapping anywhere on the screen doesn't do it - and they don't disappear on their own. I've been able to make it go away <em>sometimes</em> by scrolling until the input message box is in view, but then the top part of the page goes AWOL and there's no bringing it back: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/V91VN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.sstatic.net/V91VN.png</a>.</p>

<p>If I reply to a specific message, the input box at the bottom sticks around like it should, and the messages scroll fine behind it... but the header disappears completely (similar to <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/V91VN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this screenshot</a>, but without even a sliver of blue at the top).</p>

"276145","Mismatch between /reputation and epic badge tracker","<p>There is a mismatch between what /reputation shows and my badge tracker for 'epic':</p>

<pre>days represented 1269
rep cap was reached via rep from upvotes *only* on 42 days
<b><i>earned at least 200 reputation on 45 days</I></b>
earned 36 reputation from suggested edits</pre>

<p>Meanwhile, the next badge tracker for epic shows 44/50:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/idUse.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/idUse.png"" alt=""epic badge tracker""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears to be caused by a user who had voted on a post of mine that was deleted (I saw a 'deleted user -10' show up in my rep history a bit ago).</p>

<p>So, in /reputation, it shows:</p>

<pre><code>-- 2016-02-10 rep +200  = 47281     
-- 2016-02-11 rep +215  = 47496    
</code></pre>

<p>while the reputation log on the site shows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/gbdmA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gbdmA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason that I'm a bit below 200 was that I down voted several answers at 22:27.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/D8eYq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/D8eYq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the reputation (and thus badge tracking) hasn't caught up with the reputation that wasn't assigned after the deleted user's vote was removed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/cis8N.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/cis8N.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see 21:34 down vote rep getting that rep 'back' with the 21:40 upvote (limited to +1 because of the rep cap).</p>

<p>However, the 22:27 down votes weren't 'recovered"" with the 22:39 up vote to reset it back to 200 rep cap for the day, and thus a mismatch between the reputation cap information on /reputation and displayed for the epic badge tracking.  I believe that this is from a user being deleted who had upvoted a post that day, and the removal process isn't properly recalculating the reputation for the purposes of badge tracking.</p>

<p>I will note the possibility that I've confused all of this and /reputation and the epic badge tracker are looking different things, but if that is the case, then there's <em>still</em> a bug (just that this isn't the underlying cause).</p>

"276788","Don't make tag edits bump posts","<p>Currently, editing a question's tags causes the question to be bumped to the top of the active tab. As I understand it, a question being bumped to the top of active is saying ""Hey, community, something interesting/substantial happened to this question and you might want to check it out!"". In my opinion, tag edits are not substantial enough to make it worth bumping the question, as they are mostly janitorial edits.</p>

<p>Consider the following common reasons for editing a question's tags:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question was tagged incorrectly, by using an irrelevant tag or a combination of tags that don't make sense together</li>
<li>A tag that the question used has been retired or otherwise changed so that it no longer applies</li>
<li>A new tag has been created that would apply to the question, perhaps better than one or more of the current tags</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are janitorial edits - not substantial enough to warrant increased attention from the community, but rather something that needs to be done to keep the site clean. In the real world, it would be like getting an email at work every time the maintenance staff replaces a light bulb.</p>

"276796","Allow customizable ""magic links"" on a per-site basis.","<p>When writing comments, you can type certain ""magic links"" to link to common help pages. For example, if a new post is lacking a minimal, complete and verifiable example, I can just write</p>

<pre><code>Please provide an [mvce].
</code></pre>

<p>And this will be replaced with the appropriate link. This is extremely convenient on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>However, lots of the smaller sites have their own frequently used help pages. For example, on one of the sites I'm most active on, Programming Puzzles and Code-Golf, we have a meta post called <a href=""http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/2140/sandbox-for-proposed-challenges/"">""The Sandbox""</a> where users can post challenges to get constructive feedback on how to make their challenge better. If I want to point a user to the sandbox, I have to open a new tab, search for the sandbox, copy and paste the url, and enter the hotlink syntax. It would be a lot more convenient if I could just write:</p>

<pre><code>You should try posting this challenge to the [sandbox].
</code></pre>

<p>And the same idea is applicable on all of the smaller sites. Now, there are a lot of links like this that could be useful. Each site probably has a better picture of useful links for that site than anyone else would. </p>

<p>I propose we add a method to customize this for each site. A moderator can add a shortcut to a list of site-specific shortcuts like this:</p>

<pre><code>[sandbox] = http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/2140/sandbox-for-proposed-challenges/
[unicorns] = http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/37328/my-god-its-full-of-unicorns
[addiction] = http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11652/how-addicted-to-stack-overflow-are-you

"277102","Can we add the triple backticks feature for code formatting in markdown?","<p><sup>Disclaimer: My request is about using the same markdown format used in GitHub for code blocks and syntax highlighting.</sup></p>

<p>In most recent markdown formatters, other than the 4 space indentations, we can create code samples by <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">using triple ticks</a> before and after the code block, for example:</p>

<pre><code>```
this would become a code block
```
</code></pre>

<p>On the top of my head, I can think of 2 advantages:</p>

<h3>Line length</h3>

<p>Using backticks instead of the current format would allows us to gain 4 extra characters for each line of code inside the editor. I find this really advantageous as the editor currently allows 79 characters per line and 78 when the scroll bar is showing on the right.<br>
This is just around the 80 character limit which most programming languages suggest. Thus giving us back those 4 extra characters would be quite nice in my opinion.</p>

<p><em>I'm currently using Firefox on Ubuntu, but I don't believe the character count per line would be much different on a different browser/OS, probably 1 extra or less character per line</em>.</p>

<h3>Syntax Highlighting and ease of use</h3>

<p>Also, I find this style of formatting much simpler for use, especially when explicitly specifying the language for syntax highlighting. </p>

<p>Currently in SE, when we need to specify the language, we need to prepend the code block with the following unindented line <code>&lt;!-- language: js --&gt;</code> followed by empty line.<br>
Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- language: js --&gt;

    // JavaScript code
</code></pre>

<p>In contrast, using the triple backticks format, we would use the much simpler:</p>

<pre><code>```js
// JavaScript code
```
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, the format of the latter is much easier to remember.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm not asking to replace the current format with backticks, I'm asking if we can add this feature thus having 2 ways of formatting code.</p>

"278220","Should numbered lists be required to be sequential?","<p>Is there a way to override the Numbered List Tool's need to make numbers sequential?</p>

<p>There are times that I really appreciate the fact that it's smart enough to make the numbers sequential regardless of what I type... and then, occasionally in answers, sometimes I want to refer to something in the question using the list format but only want to mention two or three of the points being discussed that aren't necessarily sequential which requires not using the list tool at all.</p>

<p>As an example, on ELL, a user asks a question about the use of a phrase, they list four options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Option 1</li>
<li>Option 2</li>
<li>Option 3</li>
<li>Option 4</li>
</ol>

<p>In my response, I might say that Options 2 and 4 are fine but that Options 1 and 3 should be changed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Option1!</p></li>
<li><p>Option3?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, even though I'm talking about Option 3, the system has overridden the ""3."" that I typed and has converted it to ""2."".</p>

<p>So, there are two parts to this question... </p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>is there a way to override the tool's OCD need to make the numbers sequential and</p></li>
<li><p>if not, is this the behavior we want?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there a third way that allows both the magic of the simple n+1 sequence and the freedom to override the computer that thinks it knows better than I what I want?</p>

<p>Also...</p>

<ol start=""9"">
<li>I know that if I put non-list text between the list items, that's a work-around but it's not really the solution I'm interested in.</li>

<p>Retagging is not necessarily bad, but retagging sprees are a bit of a problem.<br>
Sometimes, it's a user trying to gain lots of rep the cheap way. Other times, it's users who genuinely believe they are doing the right thing... only to be called out on Meta, and finding out that people have denounced their actions behind their backs.<br>
Meanwhile, the reviewers burn through review slots that are also needed to judge more involved edits.<br>
Also, retagging bumps questions to the front page, flooding it and drowning out newer questions.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that if a user suggests several edits (say 3 edits within 5 minutes) that consist only of the same retag, a warning is given. Not unlike the warning users get after an edit has been rejected.  </p>

I then went to sleep and was planning to edit the question later this morning, since the OP refined their post to make their intentions more clear. However, I had received a follow request and a message in my ""Invite Box"" on Facebook to answer the question, in addition to a notification I had received from the Stack Exchange site.

<p>StackOverflow disables users from sending unsolicited chat notifications to avoid problems similar to this, and I would preferrably like to be contacted via the comment notification, I was wondering how I should respond to this. Should I delete my answer since it is no longer relevant and avoid answering the question? Should I update my answer to the proper solution? It makes no sense to flag the post, especially given that the message in question occurred outside of the StackOverflow network.</p>

If the moderator chooses to let it slide and accept the flag with no action, when will that same flag get re-raised?</p>

<ul>
<li>the very next closed question they ask?</li>
<li>if they start asking decent questions but then one more gets closed?</li>
<li>after 3 years of inactivity they post a question and it gets closed?</li>
</ul>

<p>How can we keep track if a user is constantly getting their questions closed off? Does accepting the flag reset their behaviour back to zero, requiring a whole new batch of questions be closed in order to re-trigger that flag, or will the flag constantly get raised each time they ask a question that gets closed? (I would hope it's closer to the latter than the former).</p>

<p>My concern is that if I accept a MCQ flag and do nothing with it (perhaps because the user is new and is finding their feet, getting better but still not quite 'there' yet) that they could keep asking poor questions and I wouldn't know about it because I dismissed the first flag and no subsequent flags were raised until they've been posting significantly more poor-quality posts.</p>

<li>undelete the post 7 days later, modify it (or not) and leave it</li>

<p>Does it make any difference if <strong>the person who posts the question on the second site is aware of the version on the first site</strong> (they didn't ask it themselves, but perhaps they answered it or commented on it, or perhaps they just happen to be an active user on the first site)?</p>

<p><strong>Would this be considered abuse?</strong> Should user X include attribution to user Y's question and/or ask user Y for permission first?</p>

"280486","Moderator Flag Annotation","<p>Flags are a great system for addressing issues in content, however sometimes the solution to a flag is not cut and dry. They may require discussion with other moderators or time to gather input from the community before a proper decision can be reached on the flag.</p>

<p>Currently, chat is available for discussing issues with other moderators, but there is no way to make notations on a flag itself about its state. Adding an ability to annotate a flag would aid moderators in coordinating when either discussion is needed or other steps that don't resolve the flag directly need to be taken. It would also offer a better audit record of the reasoning behind moderator actions for any situations where a user is upset about an action.</p>

<p>As a specific example of where this would be useful, one of the communities I moderate recently had a flag for a post that was labeled as ""off topic"". The question itself is certainly highly borderline, but not quite enough for me to close outright without giving the community a chance to take action. We decided to wait and see what the community does and close if it only receives negative attention for a certain period (since the community itself is too small to reliably close borderline questions some of the time). It would be great to be able to make note of this so we remember what is going on with that flag, but currently we just have to rely on all of our memories to keep track.</p>

"280884","Tooltips for tags when editing a question","<p>When editing a question some authors will place various almost random tags associated with a question, and I would often like to clear out excess tags or irrelivant tags (along with general question improvement). </p>

<p>However unlike the question when being ""Viewed"", on the edit screen there is no tooltip hover info for the contents of a tag, and adding new tags will not repeat already mentioned tags, so for instance I just edited a question with the tag <code>mysql</code> and the question was about PDO, so I wanted to check that the <code>mysql</code> tag was relevant, as in if the tag itself mentioned </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""for PDO queries use the PDO tag"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(the type of direction many of SO tags <strong>do</strong> have)</em> </p>

<p>It seems I can't read the information of a tag unless I delete it from a question and then retype it, this is clearly deeply inefficient and leaves a very large area for human failure (deleting a correct tag and then forgetting to readd it, etc.) just to be able to read the tag contents. </p>

<p>I'm afraid I am unlikely to memorise the summary contents of every tag on Stack OVerflow.</p>

<p>As I (and I suspect many of us) edit questions for a wide variety of reasons it's also somewhat impractical to have to remember to check and hover each question's tag before editing the question. The editing of tags is not usually the primary reason I edit the question.</p>

<p><strong>So:<br>
Can chosen tags displayed on the ""edit question"" dialog please show the tag tooltip details for the chosen tag, as it does for when the question is viewed or first written.</strong></p>

<p>Many mod teams - including the one for the site I moderate - use custom flags to mark content that should be followed up on, or to make notes, or for a variety of reasons. However, the weight of these flags in priority ends up pretty high, for what I surmise is due to three things: first, that it's an ""other"" flag; second, the flag weight of the moderator casting it; third, that these follow-up notes tend to intentionally linger a bit longer than normal, and are not necessarily immediately actionable.</p>

<p>This means that 'other' flags cast by moderators end up at the top of the priority list, which makes finding flags that actually need immediate attention a slightly more difficult task. As a result, the priority queue structure of the flag dashboard breaks down, because the assumptions for the heuristics it uses don't apply. </p>

<p>I'd like to see a feature that separates 'other' flags into two groups: ones cast by moderators, and ones cast by non-moderators. I think this would allow for easy separation of the flags that actually do require immediate attention.</p>

"281680","How can we make comment moderation one-pass instead of two-pass?","<p>A fairly common experience I have goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-flag is raised due to comment volume.</li>
<li>I visit the post and start reading the 32 comments currently there.  (More arrive while I'm doing this.)</li>
<li>I find a bunch of comments that are an argument between two users, a bunch of other comments that are chatty and tangential, a couple comments that are now obsolete... and comments #12, 19, and 28 are requests for clarification that still seem to be relevant.  I keep track of those mentally.</li>
<li>I get to the end, purge or move to chat, and then go back to hunt for those three comments that still matter.  If anything interrupts me, I risk losing track of some of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, moderating long comment threads ends up being a two-pass operation.  The alternative would be to delete comments individually as I read them, but when I do that I end up doing a lot of backtracking.  The <em>first</em> comment in that long argument doesn't necessarily set off warning bells, and I won't know that a comment is obsolete until I get to that later one that says ""thanks, updated"".</p>

<p>Is there a better way to approach this using the tools we have?  Or, is some improvement to the tools possible?  Maybe something like the ability to temporarily mark comments plus a ""purge all unmarked"" ones, but the details of that are a little tricky, both UI and the definition of ""temporary"".</p>

"281700","Why is a ""too many comments"" auto flag raised even after most of the comments have been deleted?","<p>I recently saw a ""too many comments"" auto flag on a post which had only two comments on it at the time I saw it. It turns out that a somewhat heated debate had occurred about 40 minutes before the flag was raised, and that debate resulted in 19 comments. Another moderator deleted all the comments before the 20th comment was posted within the 3 day window. Then, someone else posted a new comment within that window and that immediately triggered the auto flag -- despite the fact that there was only one comment on the post at the time that the flag was raised.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the system immediately raise a flag when the 20th comment is posted even if that comment is the only one left on the post? Why doesn't the system wait until a post has accumulated 20 comments <em>visible to regular users</em> within 3 days before raising the flag?</strong> Is this by design or an edge case?</p>

<p>I can see why it <em>might</em> be useful to flag for a moderator in the case where several users are continuing their previous conversation that was already deleted. Even so, that conversation might be useful and there's likely nothing for a moderator to do for the flag with just a comment or two on the post. Furthermore, it seems highly likely that some other user might come along and post an unrelated comment only to trigger an unhelpful flag (which is what happened with the post I saw).</p>

<p>Instead, to reduce confusion, I suggest modifying the template so that the fallback questions are all within the body of the question proper. That way it's clear that they are not answers that are supposed to be voted on <em>unless</em> they are broken out according to the existing instructions.

Now, I do realize that my device, a Polaroid L9, isn't a very popular model, so it may be difficult to test for. I suspect that this may have something to do with a discrepancy between the device's physical dimensions and actual resolution/dpi, and the display size (s/m/l/xl) and density (ldpi/mdpi/hdpi/vhdpi) that the device reports itself as having - I suspect that it's actual resolution is on the low side, and it likes to use some custom rendering to ""fake"" a higher resolution, because, for example, the stock home screen displays all app icons properly, but the Google Now Launcher displays some apps' icons as slightly ""out of focus"", as if it uses the next smaller size icon resource and scales it up.

<p>Sometimes a new community out there will start a big effort to recruit followers for an area51 definition phase. But they can be close for many reasons, even though they might be doing well in terms of follower recruitment and question upvoting.</p>

<p>As an example: Recently, SE closed a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/284151/who-really-has-the-expertise-regarding-how-new-area-51-communities-should-organi"">Neuroscience proposal</a>  when it was 6 questions away from reaching commitment phase.

<p>Does it make sense for SE to close the site before it can really evaluate how many people are there committed this new site, what is their level of expertise outside SE, what kind of take they will have on the subject.</p>

<p>What I'm arguing is that: even if the proposal is a partial duplicate of another area51 site, it is not convenient for SE to kill the proposal before the new users (new experts) establish themselves as frequent users of SE.</p>

<p>If a post already has pending delete votes from high-rep users, the ""delete"" button includes a number in brackets to show how many delete votes have already been cast. After I click this button to cast my binding delete vote, the post's display on the dashboard collapses and the button becomes an ""undelete"" button with <strong>the same figure shown in brackets</strong>, making it look as though there's now that number of pending votes to <em>un</em>delete.

"285300","I keep cancelling my edit rejects!","<p>Every now and again on a Stack Exchange site, I run across an edit that I want to reject with a custom reject message. So the typical procedure kicks in: </p>

<ul>
<li>click reject</li>
<li>select custom message</li>
<li>focus the text area</li>
<li>type<br>
(and this is where muscle memory kicks in:)</li>
<li><strong>hit tab, hit enter</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The box goes away, but I am perplexed. The suggested edit review post is still there. It takes me a while to realise what happened: rather than jumping to <em>reject</em> (or whatever it’s called; I don’t get too many suggested edits on the sites I frequent) the first tab stop is <em>cancel!</em> So on we go:</p>

<ul>
<li>swear</li>
<li>click reject again</li>
<li>select custom message again</li>
<li>focus the text area again</li>
<li>try to remember what I typed, type somthing similar</li>
<li>hit tab <strong>only just remember not to hit enter</strong></li>
<li>use the mouse to navigate to the correct button</li>
<li>reject the edit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Could the Stack Exchange team please modify this overly long workflow so that all the bullet points between <em>hit tab, hit enter</em> and <em>reject the edit</em> are removed; i.e. could the first ‘tab stop’ after the text box please be <em>perform that action</em> rather than <em>cancel?</em></p>

<p>(If this is designed to prevent overly rash rejections it doesn’t fulfil its intention: if I actually made an effort to type a reject reason I have obviously thought everything through and know what I’m doing.)</p>

<p>(For some reason, mod notice flags don’t work like this; tab+enter there posts the flag. Thus, I see no reason why it doesn’t work for edit rejects.)</p>

That syntax is usually special, and it puts that little arrow to the left of the message to signify that this is a reply.  When <code>(see full text)</code> is clicked, however, the arrow stays, but the colon and numbers are now displayed.  That makes the message look a little odd.  Can we change that, please?</p>

<p>You can create the filter using the documentation pages of the API, for example <a href=""http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/answers#order=desc&amp;sort=activity&amp;filter=!mtJRtiCxbX&amp;site=stackoverflow&amp;run=true"">here</a>.

<p>I am using the Stack Exchange API for building a realtime version of SEDE (you can find it <a href=""https://online-sql-editor.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, pick Stack Exchange from the list). I want to add all entities to it, but I have to go over each and every page, check all the check boxes and copy the filter.</p>

<p>Then I wondered: if SE can disclose the way the filter is calculated, I don't have to go over every page. Instead I can calculate the filter on the fly and pass it in (I know you can call <code>/filter/create</code> but adding an extra call to every call seems to make no sense).</p>

I am writing a code review and I could not figure this out by googling. Here is an example of the three formatting styles I tried to use (but none of them works as I would like):</p>

<h2>Case 1</h2>

<p>The task is to align the last line (see below) <em>""In the first line you use camelCase...""</em> with the last line above the numbered list.
In my first attempt, I added a new line (empty line) after the second numbered list item, and then indented by 4 spaces:</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Variable name casing</strong>: See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia article</a> on <em>""Snake Case""</em>.
In Perl, we use <em>""snake_case""</em> instead of <em>""camelCase""</em>, and be consistent. Example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Line 14: <code>my $testType</code> </li>
<li>Line 18: <code>my $right_frame</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In the first line you use camelCase, whereas in the second you use     snake_case.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>As you can see, this gives the correct indentation but it introduces a blank line above the first numbered item.</p>

<h2>Case 2</h2>

<p>In this case I do not add the blank line after the second numbered list item ( but still indent by 4 spaces ):</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Variable name casing</strong>: See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia article</a> on <em>""Snake Case""</em>.

<li>Line 18: <code>my $right_frame</code>
In the first line you use camelCase, whereas in the second you use     snake_case.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>In this case the line is considered as part of the last list item</p>

<h2>Case 3</h2>

<p>In this case, I try to add two blank spaces (invisible) at the end of the second list item:</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Variable name casing</strong>: See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia article</a> on <em>""Snake Case""</em>.

"286590","Crossposting answers on duplicate questions","<p>What is the consensus or policy on crossposting <em>answers</em> on a single Stack Exchange site or across different Stack Exchange sites? (I searched and found a lot of questions and answers about crossposting <em>questions</em> but none for answers.) I often encounter a situation where:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are duplicate questions on one or more Stack Exchange sites</li>
<li>Some these questions are linked together through the ""duplicate questions"" notices</li>
<li>Some of these questions are locked</li>
<li>Possibly some of the questions have good, comprehensive answers</li>
</ul>

<p>In some of the cases where the above happens, there are sometimes isolated questions without good answers even when good answers exist on some of the questions. In other cases, no good answer exists, but the questions are still scattered. For me, this creates a situation where I'm not sure where to post an answer even if I am confident I can answer a question well.</p>

<p>My question is about what to do in such situations. Is it okay to crosspost the same answer on all the duplicate questions? Is it okay to make one the canonical answer and link to it from the other questions?</p>

"286628","Can the thresholds for the autogenerated ""3 rude/NC comments in past 7 days"" flag be adjusted?","<p>Right now, if a user has 3 or more comments deleted as rude or not constructive, another moderator flag is automatically generated. I think it's useful to know if a user is frequently leaving rude comments, but the threshold for not constructive is too low. I don't generally care that a person has left 3 not constructive comments in a week, or even 2 not constructive and one rude comment.</p>

<p>First, rude and not constructive comments should be treated differently. Right now, there are five reasons to flag a comment - ""rude or offensive"", ""not constructive"", ""obsolete"", ""too chatty"", and ""other"" (with a comment). I'd even argue that there's (almost) no difference between ""not constructive"" and ""too chatty"", at least that I can see. There's a huge difference between rude or offensive comments or comments that don't add value (""not constructive"" or ""too chatty""). So the first step is to <strong>generate auto-flags based on more appropriate groupings of comment flags</strong>.</p>

<p>Second, please <strong>adjust the thresholds</strong>. I honestly don't care that much if someone is leaving 3 or even 5 low value comments in a week. Although this could depend on site volume, I suppose. I don't know if this is site-configurable or not, but on Software Engineering, let me see if someone has 7+ low value comments deleted in a week. Why 7? It works out to an average of 1 low value comment per day. On the other hand, 3 rude/offensive comments in a week is better, but I'd even be OK with someone getting 3-5 rude/offensive comments deleted in a 30 day window. Lower the bar for informing me that a user is pushing the bounds of the Be Nice policies.</p>

"286815","Inconsistency between daily voting limit and weekly votes after unupvote?","<p>Earlier today, on another SE site, I casted 40 votes, so I reached my ""<em>Daily up/down vote limit</em>"". Because of that, I also see a message like ""<em>Daily up/down vote limit reached; come back in X hours.</em>"" for the review queues ""First posts"" (<code>/review/first-posts</code>) and ""Late Answers"" (<code>late-answers/stats</code>). So far no problem.</p>

<p>Later on today, 1 of the posts which I voted on (via 1 of my 40 votes from today) got edited. After that, I performed an <strong><code>unupvote</code></strong> for that post (which is possible after a post is edited). After I did so, I went back to check the review queues (at <code>/review</code>) to verify if I'd still have that message like ""<em>Daily up/down vote limit reached; come back in X hours.</em>"". Sure enough, that message was still there (and it's still there right now, many hours later).</p>

<p>A few minutes after I casted those 40 votes, I also went to check the total number of the votes I casted this week already, via <code>/users?tab=Voters&amp;filter=week</code>. And a few minutes ago (= many hours later), I went back to check this <code>/users?tab=Voters&amp;filter=week</code> again, since I was curious to see if an <strong><code>unupvote</code></strong> causes the number of votes I casted this week to be recalculated or not (somewhere in the minutes/hours after it happened). And sure enough: the number of votes I casted this week is now reduced with exactly 1. So far no problem, seems to work as it should.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, as per this recalculation, it appears to me like the number of votes I casted today is <code>40-1=39</code>, so <em>I have the impression</em> I have 1 vote left for today. But if that is the case, then ""<em>Daily up/down vote limit reached; come back in X hours.</em>"" does no longer apply. Nevertheless, I still get that ""<em>Daily up/down vote limit reached; come back in X hours.</em>"" message in the 2 above mentioned review queues (the only difference is that the value of X went down ...).</p>

<p>Am I missing something, or is this to be considered as a bug?</p>

"287275","API /answers/{id}/flags/add route has multiple bugs","<p>The API route to <a href=""https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/create-answer-flag"">flag an answer</a> has a couple of issues. The first of these may or may not be a bug, but the second definitely is.</p>

<p>Firstly, sending a request that's apparently identical to the example request that the API console sends fails. On trying to flag Stack Overflow answer #40769255, the API console sends the following parameters to <code>https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/answers/40769255/flags/add</code>:</p>

<pre>id: 40769255
option_id: 22992
key: <em>my API key</em>
access_token: <em>my write token</em>
preview: true
filter: default
site: stackoverflow</pre>

<p>When I send a similar (semantically identical, apart from the lack of <code>filter</code> parameter) request from my Rails web app to <code>https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/answers/40769255/flags/add</code>:</p>

<pre>option_id: 22992
key: <em>my API key</em>
preview: true
access_token: <em>my write token</em>
site: stackoverflow
id: 40769255</pre>

<p>I get the following 400 Bad Request:</p>

<pre><code>{""error_id"":400,""error_message"":""comment"",""error_name"":""bad_parameter""}
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried including a <code>comment</code> parameter. With an empty parameter, this fails with the same error. With a 16-character <code>comment</code> parameter, the request <em>succeeds</em> (for a NAA flag, which <em>doesn't</em> require a comment). Which leads me on to bug #2...</p>

<p><strong>The flag doesn't get created.</strong></p>

<p>As I said, I was trying to flag #40769255 on Stack Overflow. After the successful request, I opened the flag menu on the answer, expecting it to tell me that I have an NAA flag cast. It doesn't.</p>

<p>Neither does my flag history list any flags on that answer.</p>

<p>This is <em>definitely</em> a bug, since the API request should not return a 200 OK unless the flag has actually been created.</p>

<p>One of the question was answered by a really not that good of an answer (so the question is closed, but that answer is the only one to show), and the second question had no answer at all.</p>

<p>Now if someone will see the first question and its answer, he will be giving the sense that this answer is ok to work with it, and no one can give other answers, or they won't bother as that question is closed, so those users will be using the wrong way. </p>

<p>The second answer is actually more important, because the question had actually couple of right answers, and couple of right ways to do what the OP wanted, but the duplicate that was linked to it was a specific one way (the OP asked for a specific way to do it, so i can't answer with the other way to do it as it won't be answering the question), but again, because the question is closed, no one will bother answering it or take a look if its really a duplicate?</p>

<p>I don't have enough points to comment or chat, so i can't do anything about it, but SO is about helping people to understand code, the first question was a typo of the OP and needed exactly 2 lines to answer it (first line the code, and second is where his problem was), the second question had few answers but yet the duplicate only specifically talking about one of those answers.</p>

<p>So i kinda have 2 questions, do we really need to close questions without giving any answer?
If a questions have couple of ways to do it, does it really a duplicate of a question that is only specifically talking about 1 way to do it?</p>

<p>So recently I had an interaction with a user, who was accusing another user of ""personally attacking"" them in the comments on their answer, over some feedback they left pointing out some flaws in their answer. Seeing this I left a comment explaining to them that critiquing their answer is not a ""personal attack"", which it simply isn't. Shortly there after this user apparently had a meltdown, and started lashing out with actual personal attacks and revenge down votes against at-least one of the involved users, me.</p>

<p>They down voted all 3 of my answer on this SE site in the space of about a minute, leaving a nonsensical ""this answer is worthless"" comment on one of them (had I had more more posts on the site, I'm sure they would have continued).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/gdw6X.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gdw6X.png"" alt=""incident 1""></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the automatic script did not detect it for some reason, so I used the contact page to request a review into this abuse, mainly because I hate to see this kind of abuse degrading the quality of SE.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I got the canned response in unrendered markdown about 2 weeks later telling me a developer would investigate the situation, and shortly there after the fraudulent votes were reversed... To which this unsavory individual responded by immediately reapplying the same fraudulent votes as soon as they noticed just under 3 hours later.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/1RvJf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1RvJf.png"" alt=""incident 2""></a></p>

<p>Following the instructions in the email on if the behavior continued, I replied to the email to say that the abuse had continued. And you guessed it, the same thing happened again! Clearly this person has some personal vendetta and doesn't mind abusing the Stack Exchange system to enact it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/jLUK4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jLUK4.png"" alt=""incident 3""></a></p>

<p>This time the automatic script got wise to their abuse though, and automatically reversed it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/rFGu2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/rFGu2.png"" alt=""incident 3 reversal""></a></p>

<p>But the story doesn't end there.</p>

<p>Apparently this user <em>really</em> wants to have their revenge almost 3 weeks later, and apparently realizing they can no longer beat the system so easily, they start spacing their votes out by a couple of days. So the day after it was reversed once again, they start doing just that.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MW4Xt.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MW4Xt.png"" alt=""incident 4""></a></p>

<p>NOTE: I realize that correlation does not imply causation, and that theoretically there could be some other users who happen to be looking at my older content and just happen to all decide to down vote while never happening to find the same post, but I think this is what <a href=""https://xkcd.com/552/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XKCD means by</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, after 3 confirmed cases of voting fraud doubtlessly by the same user, and what is almost-certainly a fourth case where they got semi-clever, I have little doubt they won't just do it again. I don't really even mind the loss of 6 paltry unicorn points, it this type of abuse in general that bugs me.</p>

<p>So what should someone do in this situation?</p>

<ul>
<li>Reply one more time to the email and see if the cycle repeats again?</li>
<li>Just let it go, and leave the fraudulent votes to skew the score?</li>
<li>Something else entirely?</li>

"287805","Can moderators see ninja edits?","<p>Suppose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone flags a post for good reason based on the content of the post</li>
<li>No one posts a comment on the post</li>
<li>Within the grace period, the OP changes the post so it no longer has the problematic content</li>
</ul>

<p>At that point, it's a ninja edit; normal users (even 10k+ or 20k+) can't see the original version of the post.</p>

<p>(Or really, even if someone doesn't flag the post but the moderator has reason to investigate it at some stage.)</p>

<p>Can a moderator see that a ninja edit occurred, and see the original version of the post?</p>

"287887","Should the merchandise and swag tags be synonyms?","<p>After digging around meta for posts about official Stack Exchange items, I've noticed a few different tags for this topic:</p>

<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/merchandise"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;merchandise&#39;"" rel=""tag"">merchandise</a> - For questions regarding Stack Exchange-branded merchandise and its distribution.</p>

<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/swag"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;swag&#39;"" rel=""tag"">swag</a> - Stuff We All Get - promotional gifts</p>

<p>Also marginally related:</p>

<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/t-shirt"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;t-shirt&#39;"" rel=""tag"">t-shirt</a> - For questions about Stack Exchange shirts?</p>

<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/shop"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;shop&#39;"" rel=""tag"">shop</a> - For questions relating to the Stack Exchange Shop and its products.</p>

<p>Because the Stack Exchange store is now closed, is there any difference between swag and merchandise?  If the store was still open, I could see that <a href=""/questions/tagged/merchandise"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;merchandise&#39;"" rel=""tag"">merchandise</a> would be used for official items that could be purchased, and <a href=""/questions/tagged/swag"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;swag&#39;"" rel=""tag"">swag</a> used for promotional items given away that would not necessarily be for sale.</p>

<p>I feel that <a href=""/questions/tagged/merchandise"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;merchandise&#39;"" rel=""tag"">merchandise</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/swag"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;swag&#39;"" rel=""tag"">swag</a> now occupy the same domain and should be synonyms.</p>

<p>I asked someone else if they could check, and they <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34053173#34053173"">said</a> that they could also see the grey banner, though not in the places where I can see it.</p>

<p>More specifically, the <code>ignored</code> class seems to be added on the user container. It resizes the avatar, but the height of the container is governed by <code>#present-users &gt; .present-user, #present-users .more</code>, which makes the height 32 pixels. I believe <code>.present-user.ignored</code> should set the <code>height</code> to <code>16px</code> to match <code>.ignored .user-gravatar32</code>.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to have the <code>/review</code> page auto-refresh counts, and display the new values live as they come in. For example, a new Suggested Edit is available, the number for Suggested Edits should instantly jump up.</p>

<p>In the same vein, if I'm not on the Review tab, a little notification counter, like on Chat, should be present, counting up for each new review item added since I've last visited the tab:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/m2BbH.png"" alt=""(1) Review - Ask Ubuntu""></p>

<p>Again, like chat, this number should dismiss when I visit the tab and check on what's going on. Perhaps, if at all possible, a desktop notification could also come up on a new Review item, provided I've enabled that feature.</p>

<p>If it doesn't get reversed now, I'll hit the rep cap very soon and be blocked from getting more.  Then tomorrow all that will be reversed automatically.  I will have answered many more questions tonight and the up-votes that I will likely get won't count because will already be at the cap.  Then when the votes get reversed, I'll lose that ill gotten rep but the other rep won't be compensated for.</p>

"289674","Question closed on one site, would be welcome on another - any reason not to migrate?","<p>Consider the following set of circumstances.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A question is posted on one SE site (call it site A) and <strong>closed</strong>. It could be closed for a variety of reasons - from off-topic to simply not meeting site A's quality standards. (Let's assume it's <em>not</em> closed as duplicate - there's no issue of it adding value to A by increasing searchability.) It also gets <strong>downvoted</strong>, so that after a certain time it will be auto-deleted from A by the roomba.</p></li>
<li><p>Another SE site (call it site B) would welcome this question: on B, it would be not only <strong>on-topic</strong> but also considered <strong>good quality</strong>, at least enough to receive a few upvotes. (In the case it was simply off-topic on A, this is easily explained simply by the scope difference between A and B. If it was closed for another reason, this just means B has less exacting standards than A for that type of question.) B regularly takes questions very similar to this one, which don't get closed there.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course there's a possibility that the question might be edited to be reopenable on A. But the same is true of most closed questions, including many which get migrated every day without anyone waiting around to see if their OPs come back to edit them.</p>

<p>Given that the community of B would welcome these questions, should the moderators of A migrate them over? Of course there are plenty of invalid migration flags every day - I've declined many of these myself as a mod - so let's assume that <strong>the <em>moderators</em> of B, or someone else who can be trusted implicitly to know B's scope, confirm that they want the question.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Given all of this, is there any reason <em>not</em> to migrate the question from A to B?</strong></h3>

<p>I know it's <em>necessary</em> for a question to be off-topic for source site, on-topic for target, and good quality (for target site) in order to be migrated. So I guess my question is, is this also <em>sufficient</em>? Or is it up to the mods/community of A to decide whether or not to migrate a question that B would definitely like?</p>

<p>The alternative to getting it migrated, upvoted, and answered on B would be leaving it on A to rot away and be auto-deleted, which is no use to anyone, neither site nor the OP.</p>

<p>Or is this something that should be decided on a site-by-site basis, e.g. by a meta question on A's meta for whether the site should be willing to consider migrating questions to B?</p>

<p><br>
<sub>The sites this would likely be most relevant to are <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">English Language &amp; Usage</a> and <a href=""http://ell.stackexchange.com"">English Language Learners</a>, as many ELU questions which would be closed for not meeting their quality standards get migrated to ELL and welcomed there. But it could be relevant to many other pairs of sites too - including those where no migration path is set up and all migrations have to be done by moderators - so I'm posting this to main meta instead of a per-site meta.</sub></p>

<p>So I figure there is a problem with the <code>OpenID</code> login process or I entered the wrong username, so I click the <code>back</code> button in my <em>browser</em> and then dig out my login credentials from 1Password that I have stored for StackOverflow so I can login with those instead.</p>

<p>When I go back to the page, I am presented with this page (note the additional login options are now collapsed):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/VtXoS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VtXoS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I put in the login details and click the <em>Log In</em> button, however, once again I am presented with the same <code>OpenID</code> error message of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No OpenID endpoint found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scratched my head for a few seconds there wondering why I was still getting that error when I was trying to login normally now; then I expanded the additional login options section again, noticed my <em>username</em> was still entered into the <code>OpenID</code> field and perhaps that was affecting it; once I removed my username I was then able to login successfully.</p>

<p>I guess being that a lot of the <strong>StackExchange</strong> sites are quite technical a lot of users who run into this issue may be able to work it out themselves, but I believe it still is a usability issue and would cause more of a problem for users that come across it that frequent the less technical SE sites.</p>

"290142","""More than 10 answers posted in the last 7 days"" flag + new question is usually not helpful; can we adjust?","<p>As a moderator on a high-activity site I see the ""too many answers"" Community auto-flag fairly often.  This flag (on a question) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than 10 answers posted in the last 7 days</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(There's also a 30-answer version.  You can probably guess how I know that.)</p>

<p>On our site, it's pretty common for a new question that hits the Hot Network Questions list to get 10 answers in the first day.  And that's not a bad thing (for us).  When I get one of these flags I page through the answers looking for anything explosive, downvoted answers, deleted answers, and spam.  If something stands out I handle it, but usually I end up just dismissing the flag.</p>

<p>What I <em>don't</em> do is try to determine if there are duplicates, or evaluate the quality of not-obviously-bad answers -- not my job.  The community needs to take the lead there.  And they won't know that there's answer-review work to be done unless they come across the question on their own or somebody brings it up, because they don't see the flag.</p>

<p>Could we do something better with this flag?  I think any of the following would be better than what we have now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't raise the flag on new questions.  They're on the front page and, being new, are more likely to be read.  Possible implementation: don't count answers posted within the first 24 hours after the question was asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Count only answers that are score 0 (-1?) or below.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of raising a moderator flag, send these questions to a new review queue, perhaps ""Oft-Answered Questions"".  Some design work is needed here because the <em>question</em> goes to the queue but actions need to be taken on <em>answers</em>.</p></li>

Well, OK, full of ideas, some of which might be great.  If you squint hard enough. I frequently think up feature requests for SE, because I'm a frequent user.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I decide to stop being lazy and actually come to Meta.SE to post the feature I thought up as a request.</p>

<p>9 times out of 10 (or more often), I discover that someone already thought up the same feature before, and there's an older request for the same thing posted. With no sign of <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-declined"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-declined</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-completed"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-completed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-completed</a> or response from SE team.</p>

<p>Now, there are ways to get extra attention to existing SE (including Meta) posts, but my working assumption here is, that's a fool's work.

"290746","Stack Overflow code snippet tool bug: `console.log` incorrectly reports missing array slot as undefined","<p>The Stack Overflow code snippet tool produces an ambiguous and, depending on your definitions, incorrect output when using the JavaScript <code>console.log</code> command with an array that has missing slots, i.e. a sparse array.</p>

<p>I show below screen-shots of the input and output for using <code>console.log([undefined,,4])</code> from within the Stack Exchange code snippet tool as well as from within the browser consoles of various common browsers.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow code snippet tool input:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/VejRU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VejRU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/9JLap.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/9JLap.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Note that in this output the first and second elements are shown identically, i.e. as <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>The identical command shows the following output in the browser consoles in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera:</p>

<p>Chrome:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/kZ3yF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kZ3yF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/JvLGE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JvLGE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/lR9vH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lR9vH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In each of these browser consoles the output is unambiguous and correct. Specifically, only the first element is reported as <code>undefined</code> and the element with index 1 is shown as missing/non-existent. In contrast, the output from within the code snippet tool is at least confusing/misleading if not technically incorrect (depending on how you define what the output of <code>console.log</code> should be).</p>

<p>I believe that the output of <code>console.log</code> in the code snippet tool should mirror the output from the browser consoles with respect to reporting missing slots in JavaScript sparse arrays, both because it will be clearer and because it will be consistent with browser console output.</p>

<p>Note that the above analysis did not include Internet Explorer 11 which has its own bug related to this issue. Just so responders don't waste their energy pursuing this, I show the IE11 bug here, when I try to show the same thing in the IE11 console. Note the doubling up of the element with index 2, which is reported as both <code>undefined</code> <em>and</em> as <code>4</code>, which is clearly wrong.</p>

<p>I can't see any reason why such a user should be allowed to continue casting votes on the site. They've already decided that they're soon going to be a non-user, and they won't be able to vote at that point anyway; and if they really want to continue voting, all they have to do is cancel the deletion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are sometimes good reasons why they <em>shouldn't</em> be allowed to vote in this period. In many cases (not all), a user deleting their account is in the middle of some sort of ""rage quit"", and an obvious thing for a ragequitting user to do would be to <strong>leave a bunch of downvotes before they go</strong>, as a form of <a href=""http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Hitting_on_the_break"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hitting on the break</a>. If they do it soon enough before the deletion, they might even be able to get away with doing things which would normally be reversed by the serial voting algorithm. Or, worse, they could <strong>unaccept answers to all their questions</strong> - downvotes can be invalidated by SE employees, but nobody except the OP can re-add checkmarks to answers. For that matter, even the standard ragequitter practice of <strong>deleting all their posts</strong> could count as a sort of voting - it's disabled during account suspension, so why not during pending deletion periods too?</p>

"291535","Allow moderators to rollback locked posts (more easily)","<p>Locked posts really are <em>locked</em> to most users. To moderators, however, locked posts are substantially less locked. Moderators can edit them, post comments to them, delete comments from them, and even if need be <em>unlock</em> them.</p>

<p>There is a curious gap in moderator powers, however. Moderators cannot rollback a locked post. A not uncommon use of locking (at least on Mathematics, where I <s>rule</s> reside) is when a user is continually defacing their question (because they'd really rather delete it, but cannot due to answers) and you just want to hit pause on that situation. </p>

<p>I have just recently experienced a case where a user re-defaced their question within 20 seconds of my having rolled it back. When faced with a user who is this determined to deface their posts, a much easier workflow would be to first lock the post and <em>then</em> put it into a previous good state. I should now note that there <em>are</em> ways of doing this.</p>

<ol>
<li>As moderators can edit locked posts, just go to the source of the previous good revision, copy it, and make a good new revision.</li>

The question is asking why burnination request questions often have funny titles and had a list of links to examples of questions with these kinds of titles, all links in that list used plain URL as markdown code, which automatically displayed the titles of the questions. Since one of those questions had changed title, I decided to edit it so that the link would display the old title instead, which is more relevant to the question.</p>

<p>This is the code of how the link was displayed first:</p>

<pre><code>http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/295233/should-we-throw-corners-in-the-corner

<pre><code>[Should we throw the [corners] in the corner?](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/295233/should-we-throw-corners-in-the-corner)

<p>When I noticed that, I undid my edit. That didn't solve the problem, the links were still displayed as URLs. So I tried to rollback, and that didn't either solve the problem. So the only way I could solve this problem was to manually edit each link to make it display the title of the question.</p>

"292158","Automated warning for questions about something that ""does not work""","<p>All too often on various SE sites I see questions which share a common flaw: the OP states that his contraption <em>does not work</em>, without any useful information about the issue. A comment asking for clarification usually appears shortly after the question is posted, after which the question is typically put on hold as unclear, unless the OP is quick enough to provide a useful description of their problem.</p>

<p>I wonder if it's possible to warn well-meaning users in advance, so they don't have to rush against the close votes piling up, by showing them a warning message while they're writing their question, e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that <em>does not work</em> is not a useful problem statement. Please explain what behavior <strong>you have observed</strong> and what you <strong>expected to see</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This way, users who strive to write a good question will get the warning before their experience is spoiled by downvotes / close vote / sarcastic comments. Those who don't care will of course post anyway, but at least I'll spend less time dealing with them, since there will be no need to ask for clarification, wait, check again and vote to close: I'll know I can vote to close directly.</p>

<p>When I started writing this question I was going to suggest imposing a restriction to <em>does not work</em> questions, like the one we have for the word <em>problem</em>.

<p>In my humble opinion, HTML entities can be very useful. I would be able to freely type ""&mdash;"" with <code>&amp;mdash;</code> and ""&ndash;"" with <code>&amp;ndash;</code> instead of looking up their Unicode, instead of the really short and annoying hyphen. Heck, the minus sign is itself larger than a hyphen.</p>

<p>So, what is the rationale behind not allowing HTML entities? If it's potential for abuse, wouldn't it be better to disallow posting a message containing nothing but <code>&amp;nbsp;</code><sup>1</sup>? Or is there some other reason these aren't parsed?</p>

"293097","More emphasis on scope for new users","<p>I've noticed that many new users post questions that fall out of the scope of a particular site and get closed. Often these are very common (such as idea generation on Worldbuilding SE or homework problems on a science SE site). These get closed with only a two-line explanation that doesn't adequately explain what the scope is and why it is needed and why the particular question doesn't lie in scope.</p>

<p>Therefore I think there should be a clear page that explains the concept of scope and also a list of site specific examples of commonly received types of questions from new users that actually fall out of scope. These examples can be crafted using hypothetical users. Examples do help teach scope properly. And it is easier to convince someone that their question is similar to an example that is declared off-scope rather than an abstract explanation like 'idea generation not allowed'.</p>

<p>P.S. This is perhaps even more important than explaining how reputation works, which can be explained to users who actually plan to stay longer than a couple of questions.</p>

<p>Some people have downvoted the question probably because of not being the kind of question of somebody who has really made an effort to find a solution by himself. Therefore my prize for trying to share my code is losing reputation and I feel that discouraging.</p>

<pre><code>.realtime-post-deleted-notification {

"294663","Protected questions and overall SO network reputation","<p>I recently wanted to give an answer on an SO platform, but instead had to write a comment.</p>

<p>The weird thing is, that I think the comment would have been a decent answer, which in turn could bump me well above the threshold to answer protected questions.</p>

<p>I also have the 100 rep bonus, and 1900 reputation or more overall on the SO network.</p>

<p>I think it would be cool if a user with enough reputation say 1000 or 1500 overall on the SO network (real reputation not with the bonus counted), could still answer protected questions.</p>

<p>The reason is that I think it's unlikely that someone with a lot of reputation would write a bad answer on another SO platform.</p>

<p>I don't know if it can be implemented though and what each SO platform has access to.</p>

<p>I mean you can still give the information in a comment, or ask someone in chat to post it for you, but you will forfeit the potential gain of reputation, which then would allow you to answer future protected questions (which are the ones you are most likely to see, because you're likely not actively search on that particular network, but instead only see the hot networks)</p>

<p>Ofcourse you could argue that this is design, but somehow I think that this could prevent a few people which could post gem answers for specific situation/contexts they are familiar with, but are simply not active on that network.</p>

<p>Late Answers audits are too hard for the following reason:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The audits are mainly picked from ""Close Vote"" queue. This means that those audits don't reflect the characteristics of ""Late Answer"". Such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicating current answer (can only be checked <strong>by viewing all answers</strong>)</li>
<li>Low quality answer</li>
</ul>

<p>These are hard to flag:</p>

  <p>Any post that attempts to answer the question, however badly is still an answer. You can downvote such posts to signal that the answer is a bad answer, but it is still an answer. <em><a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/265552/when-to-flag-an-answer-as-not-an-answer"">When to flag an answer as &quot;not an answer&quot;?</a></em></p>

<li><p>The guidelines are unclear. One thing that I think it needs improvement is the treatment of link-only answers. They're often taken from Low Quality Posts queue, and at there an appropriate reason for deletion exists. However, at LA queue the correct choice is flagging as ""low quality post"". Low quality posts enters Triage today, and the purpose of flag is less clear than others.</p></li>

<p>Presumably at least one of the people downvoting and/or commenting has flagged the post with a mod flag with the word ""plagiarism"" in it, triggering the special handling of those in the mod queue. But I don't <em>know</em> that, of course; we mere mortals can't see flags on posts.</p>

<p>Is it useful in terms of dealing with repeat plagiarists for me to flag the post even though it's been self-deleted? (This does not apply, of course, to posts deleted by a mod or the community, only ones the plagiarist deletes themselves, realizing they've been caught.)</p>

<p>Similar to other badges, there can be three levels with progressively larger numbers, creating sets of bronze, silver and gold.</p>

<p>There are different types of links to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linked from a duplicate (applies only to questions).</li>
<li>Linked from a post on the same SE site.</li>
<li>Linked from a comment on the same SE site.</li>
<li>Linked from a post on any SE site.</li>
<li>Linked from a comment on any SE site.</li>
<li>Linked anywhere on the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The the last is easy to game and already represented by the Announcer/Booster/Publicist trio, I think we can savely disregard it.</p>

<p>As for the others, I think one can reasonably draw the line at any point, or even create different badges. A question with many duplicates may have very different qualities from one that is mentioned in many different contexts.</p>

<p>Even though I'm more interested in the principle, here are some concrete proposals (don't give me crap for the names, and the numbers certainly require tuning):</p>

<ul>
<li>Foresight/Prescience/Oracle: question has 5/50/200 duplicates</li>
<li>Handout/Article/Textbook: post linked from 20/100/500 posts on the same site</li>
<li>Connective/Interdisciplinary/Fundamental: post linked from 2/5/10 different SE sites</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible reason against: There are already badges for ""good"" posts. -- 
Why, yes, several in fact: there are badges for views, votes, and favorites. None of these capture how relevant a post is to other posts, and can one more hurt?</p>

"295151","How can I have additional favorite tags suggested?","<p>I like using the favorite tags feature on Travel.SE, but I suspect there's some tags that I like but I haven't added yet. For example, as of today, I <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/324/andrew-grimm?tab=tags"">frequently</a> ask about ""local-customs"", but don't have it as a favorite tag, and likewise for ""hot-springs"" and ""kansai"" (a region in Japan, which I do have as a favorite tag).</p>

<p>Approaches I can think of, and why there's problems with them:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I see an interesting question, and it isn't highlighted as having a favorite tag, and it has a tag that's interesting to me, add it as a favorite tag: one problem is that I partially use the highlighting of questions to find questions that are interesting to me, rather than looking at all of the questions. There's a lot of visa questions on there which I find boring.</li>
<li>Look at my <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/324/andrew-grimm?tab=tags"">tags page</a>: there's no indication of which tags have already been categorized as favorite or not. So for each tag on that page, I have to then scan my existing favorite tags to see if it's included. Also, some of the tags are just based on a single answer that got a lot of reputation, such as ""i94"" having <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10252/whats-the-value-of-the-genocide-and-similar-questions-on-the-us-immigration-f/10254#10254"">this answer</a>.</li>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <h3>Can I specify command line options in a Pandoc Markdown document?</h3>
  
  <p>Sometimes, a <code>*.md</code> file requires (due to its content) a certain set of command line options regardless of the desired output or of
  other, more optional command line options.
  E.g. when the document contains pandoc-fignos-style figure markup, <code>--filter pandoc-fignos</code> will always be required when wanting
  meaningful non-intermediate output.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of having to remember which of my Pandoc documents requires what options, can I declare arbitrary command line options within the
  file itself, e.g. inside the YAML metadata? Or is there a
  corresponding metadatafield for each and every option that I could
  set instead. (If the latter, how can I find out about those field,
  e.g., what would be the corresponding field to <code>--filter</code>?)</p>

</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <h3>Can I specify multiple bibliography (BibTeX) files in Pandoc Metadata?</h3>
  
  <p>Often, journal websites and other sources offer downloadable <code>*.bib</code> files for referring to individual articles. If I use these, I like to keep them as they are instead of merging them into a single file.
  On the command line, several files can be specified by passing the <code>--bibliography</code> option multiple times. Can I also list multiple files in the YAML metadata inside the document itself?</p>

This has helped hold back the tide of awful questions coming into Stack Overflow, and I think the site would have completely fallen apart without it.</p>

<p>However, many people are desperate to have their questions answered, particularly if their job depends on it. These people shotgun bad questions, get their account blocked or rate-limited by the system, and then immediately proceed to create a new account and keep posting. The current mechanisms for blocking the creation of these new accounts are not as effective as they should be.</p>

<p>As a result, at least on Stack Overflow moderators have taken to deleting accounts obviously created to evade question blocks using the deletion options intended for trolls. By deleting these accounts as ""this user is no longer welcome to participate on this site"", the system builds a temporary block on any posts from new accounts at a location. This is extremely effective in stopping users who create account after account to dump terrible questions on the site.</p>

<p>However, we'd also like to have this annotated on the main account to let us know that someone has a history of creating accounts to evade system limits. At present, we have to open up a second tab to manually enter this in for the main account (and we usually forget to do so).</p>

<p>I'd like to streamline this entire process by having a new deletion option added under the user account <code>actions | delete</code> menu item. Entitled ""This user is a ban / suspension evasion account of:"", when selected this action would bring up a list of all question- or answer-banned accounts at the account's last IP address.</p>

<p>Choosing the main account from this list and confirming the deletion would lead to a deletion of the puppet account, trigger the same location-based penalties as a ""no longer welcome"" deletion does, and annotate the main account with the details of this deleted account and why it was deleted.</p>

<p>We currently have a similar process for deleting voting sock puppet accounts, and that works extremely well. I believe this would make it easier to deal with question-ban evaders and formalize the ad hoc process we use right now.</p>

<p>All right, I've gotten pretty used to how notifications work in the Q&amp;A areas. This is aided by the fact that I get an autocompletion dropdown when I start typing <code>@someone</code>.</p>

<p>Now, however, StackExchange suggested I take a long comment chain to chat, and being a good citizen, I did. And now, in this totally new world, I'm lost as to what to do to get the other participant to be notified (in the top bar) of my messages in chat.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure if he'd be notified by default (just because the original comment chain was in reply to a post of his), so I tried to begin with <code>@hisName</code> but didn't get autocompletion, so I assumed the ""tagging-notification"" feature doesn't work in chat.</p>

<p>Next I tried to click the reply button (that says ""link my next chat message as a reply to this"") on the first message in the chat, which was an automatic message by ""Feeds"" that quoted the other person's answer. But when I sent my message, I saw that in the resulting chat line, the other person wasn't tagged - the user who was tagged was ""Feeds"". So I assumed that also wouldn't work to make the intended recipient get notified.</p>

<h1>The question</h1>

<p><strong>Can I get an authoritative answer regarding when notifications are delivered (to the top bar) and when not?</strong></p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I @tag an user (manually, without clicking any reply button, because I don't like hunting for tiny buttons), will he get notified?</li>
<li>If I just write in a chat that got started by accepting ""Stack Exchange's suggestion to continue in chat"", will the one who posted the original question/answer be notified?</li>

"296065","Don't duplicate efforts between apps and mobile site","<p>There are a few reasons I can think of to have an Android or iOS app for Stack Exchange:</p>

<ul>
<li>it allows for notifications on your phone</li>
<li>it gives users that expect an app and search in the App Store something to find</li>
<li>at minimum, an app is a convenient bookmark for the site</li>
</ul>

<p>In practical use, the current Android app is strictly inferior to the mobile site in my experience. I'll just add a few issues here I remember running into:</p>

<ul>
<li>MathJax doesn't work in question lists or in comments</li>
<li>you can't see deleted posts at all, even if you have the privilege</li>
<li>the list of favorite sites for switching isn't synced from the list on the desktop site</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are aspects that the app does better, but the last one I remember was the seamless login into all sites at once, but that issue has been fixed on the websites for a while now, so the app has no advantage here anymore. But I can't think of any features related to the actual browsing and asking/answering/editing experience that would be infeasible to implement in a mobile website. </p>

<p>The one killer feature of the apps are the notifications, there are quite a few heavy users of SE that find those useful from what I observed. So my suggestion would be to focus the apps on the part that isn't easily possible with a mobile website. </p>

<p>For me, the current restrictions of the Android app are annoying enough that I pretty much always use the mobile site, even though I have the app installed for the notifications. The ideal app for me would provide notifications, but simply redirect to the mobile website when I follow them.</p>

<p>There's still enough stuff in the mobile site that could be added or improved. Instead of splitting the efforts between the Android app, the iOS app and the mobile website, focusing on the website alone for the core SE usage should take less effort.</p>

"296488","What was the old identicon generation algorithm?","<p>About a year ago, in August, I think, there were some changes made to a hashing algorithm(?) covering up some security hole, or what not, and my avatar was changed as a consequence, and I was wondering whether there is a way for me to get it generated again somehow. I have used various hashing algorithms provided along online identicon generators, but non of them give the same image I have had which makes a lot of guesswork because I don't know whether it is the hash method that is used that is different, or implementation of the generator. </p>

This is not for lack of desire; rather in the heat of the moment (servers down, etc.), I'm not thinking about formally recognizing good answers, I'm simply looking for a solution as quickly as I can.</p>

<p>On the flip side, when I'm just browsing, I'm rarely trying to solve an issue, so I lack the immediate ""I just tested this method and it worked for me"" experiential basis upon which to upvote (or downvote) anything.  Also, it's rather difficult to remember many of the questions/answers that I visited previously in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>It would be really nice if I could ""flag"" answers for future review.  The flagged answer would be put into a queue for me to visit later and decide whether to upvote or downvote.</p>

"296895","Should dupehammer wielders use their powers to wipe obviously incorrect close-as-duplicate votes?","<p>Occasionally, a user will cast a close-as-duplicate vote that's clearly incorrect. If that vote closes the question as duplicate, a gold tag badge user in a tag for the question (""dupehammer user"") can then, as I understand it, unilaterally reopen it (thus overriding all the previous votes).</p>

<p>My question is about what happens in cases where the incorrect close vote does <em>not</em> close the post. In such a situation, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/243840/347902"">a dupehammer wielder can close and reopen the post</a> in order to clear the close votes on the question. This is clearly somewhat abusive if there are no close-as-duplicate votes, but in the case where all the close votes on the post are close-as-duplicate, doing this at least somewhat seems to tie into the dupehammer's regular functionality.</p>

<p>My question is not really about whether/when I <em>can</em> do this, but rather, when I <em>should</em>; under what circumstances should I as a dupehammer holder close and reopen a post in order to clear incorrect duplicate votes from it? Given that this is a fairly hidden feature at the moment, there's no obvious guidance for the circumstances under which I should use it.</p>

<p>In particular, is it my ""duty"" as a dupehammer user to clean up incorrect duplicate votes? Or the opposite: should I stay out of using the dupehammer to mess with vote totals, and only use it when the post is actually incorrectly open or closed? Or is the answer somewhere in between?</p>

<li>scalajs -> scala.js</li>
<li>gameloop -> game-loop</li>

<p>The only reason I can think of to have these synonyms would be to prevent new tags with those names from being created, but as far as I know certain minor variations of existing tags are already blocked automatically. That mechanism should either be sufficient for this purpose, or should be extended to cover more cases if it isn't.</p>

<p>Having unnecessary synonyms doesn't really cause much harm, but it does clutter the list and the tag suggestions, and it makes it harder to understand for users what synonyms are useful by looking at the list of existing tag synonyms.</p>

"297043","How to be a good reviewer?","<p>TLDR: My thoughts about dealing with low quality content in scope of limited resources, like edits and flags.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><em>(this is long and perhaps little boring, so you may skip directly to <strong>The problem</strong> section)</em></p>

<p>Recently I've started being a little big more active on Stack Overflow and it happened I passed the magic border of 500 reputation points. As a result I am reviewing First posts, Late answers and Triage queues. I consider myself as not very successful at this task, because majority of those questions are about subjects witch I am not even a beginner in. I am not even able to distinguish if the question (or answer) is totally rubbish or it provides some value. So, skipping is frequently in use.</p>

<p>However, this is a separate category of questions. They are asked about matters I do know and they are, well, rubbish. The user asking given question has not even tried to understand and solve the problem for himself.</p>

<p>I used to work as an instructor, training the people in some IT related subjects, so I am always for educating people. But what to do if someone asks a question, where the only reasonable answer would be RTFM (or verbatim copy of the manual)?</p>

<p>I agree, some subject are not easy, even if they look trivial for experienced people. But if someone wants to learn something, such person shall be driven by curiosity. Ok, <code>man bash</code> is long and boring. And even after 20 years of being either user, administrator as linux based software developer I cannot tell I know everything about it. And I have read it more than once. But sometimes people are coming with totally clueless questions, without any knowledge, without curiosity and - as it appears from discussion in comments under the question - without even willing to try solving it when given some hints.</p>

<p>We all know to gather some knowledge one need to spent some time reading  books and articles about the subject, doing exercises and mistakes. And then, person is coming with the question ""How to frobnicate my shmoolgulator"" and then, as an expert in shmoolgulator, you remember spending days reading books and weeks doing experiments, before you achieve your first reasonable frobnication. And only reasonable answer is: <em>""Sorry chap/lass, I cannot help you right know. But read following resources, start trying, and then come back and ask about specific problems you encountered, we will try to help you. Oh, you need the answer right now, because deadline for the work/school project is in three days. I am sorry for you.""</em> Or, if are trigger-happy short-circuited bad-tempered person: <em>""RTFM, you indolent [selfcensored]""</em>.</p>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>So, after receiving a privilege of being reviewer I happily skipped in and - just after three days - my sanity started going down. When I was able to edit the question (or answer) I did it. But the edition is a scarce resource. I have been stuck more than once because I hit the editions queue length limit. Flagging posts is a little less scarce, as each day is started with fresh limit of 10 flags. However, as I understand the insights of the system, it is just passing the burden to moderators.</p>

<h1>The questions</h1>

<p>So, what should I do in case when I use all my review related resources? Obvious solutions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>stop reviewing a queue for day</li>
<li>continue reviewing and accepting what seems to be acceptable and skipping what I consider as a candidate to flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>but I am not happy with neither of them.</p>

<p>At the very moment I am following the second choice - skipping. But my doubt is: what is the mechanic of skipping? Is it possible, that every reviewing person would take a second approach and after using her reviewing resources it will skip remaining candidates, making them, practically, unreviewed?</p>

<p>So, what's your advice?</p>

<p>Some tools have some documentation already, but e.g. the mod message help center is much more comprehensive than the inline help in the mod message dialog, which mostly links to 8 year old blog posts.</p>

<p>This kind of in-depth documentation is the most useful if you read it while you actually need to use those tools or handle a situation for the first time.

<hr>

<p>While the HNQ list creates a lot of cross-site traffic (which is wanted), it also causes issues on those sites sometimes, in particular on sites like <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/"">PuzzlingSE</a> where the 'hotness' of some questions strongly distorts the ""voting = quality"" paradigm.</p>

<p>However, I'm not about <em>fixing HNQ</em> here. Instead, I'm wondering if there is a good method to find out (via query or otherwise) if a question has in the past ever been placed on the HNQ list. ( See also: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/295727/267654"">What stats should I track in an HNQ list monitor?</a> )</p>

<p>And if not, I would like to propose this as a general feature request.
The information whether or not a question has been on HNQ is a valueable meta-info which ideally should be captured in the database.</p>

<p>It would allow</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>easy flagging</em> of such questons in some site design (i.e. an addtional icon)</p></li>
<li><p><em>easy filtering</em> for/against such questions in the search query</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed to upload image; the format is not supported</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing as I can upload them from a computer without issue, it's not actually the format so much as it's the URL or the server on one side or the other acting up.</p>

<p>As an example, I have this issue with both of the images on this article about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_(textile)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hank (textile)</a>.</p>

<p>I was able to successfully upload the top image after downloading it to use in an <a href=""https://crafts.stackexchange.com/a/3189/52"">answer on Arts &amp; Crafts</a> but could not add it directly from the link.</p>

I like the new footer, but there's one aspect I find counterintuitive:
There are two types of links but there's no difference in appearance.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I click ""Science"", the footer shows me science-related SE sites. The footer changes but I stay on the same page.</li>
<li>If I click ""About"", I'm taken to a whole new page.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two links look exactly alike, and I can't tell what will happen if I click one of the links.
After scratching my head for a moment and looking at the URL when hovering over various links, I figured out how it works.
But it'd be better if it was easier than that.
Also, inconsistent links are irritating.</p>

<p><strong>Could the links in the last column (Technology, Life / Arts, Culture / Recreation, Science, Other) have some kind of visual clue that they are different from the rest of the footer links?</strong>
Something that says ""click to expand"" and applies only to those five links would be nice.
I don't know how to solve the problem, but I think there is one.</p>

<p>I figure one option is just to have a simple notification that says ""Your flag has been resolved."" Another option is to specify the outcome - ""Your recent flag was marked helpful/disputed/declined."" and maybe include any moderator messages in the notification. Any of these would be fine, but it would just be nice to be told when a flag rather than having to actively check on the status.

"298331","Hidden Communities don't play well with comment-to-chat migrations","<p>It's come up quite a few times since Hidden Communities were implemented - users expect privacy and unexpectedly end up losing it all when conversation gets migrated to the chat system. Suddenly their name and network profile are exposed on a message which was once linked to a profile not visibly linked to the rest of the network.</p>

<p>Fixing this <em>in the chat system</em> is unlikely to happen, just because of the way chat exists. You have a single profile which operates for all the sites on our network, minus two. So if you're holding out on being able to participate in a site-specific chat room without linking to the rest of your network activity, don't get your hopes up too high.</p>

<p>However, <strong>we can prevent the surprise of suddenly losing anonymity due to no fault of the owner</strong> by doing some more pre-processing on the site before the migration of comments to chat actually occurs. A couple of solutions:</p>

<hr>

<h3>Don't migrate messages from users who have the site hidden</h3>

<p>Essentially, for each comment under the post look up the owner. If the owner has this site set as hidden, then just delete the comment and don't include it in the list of comments to be migrated into the chat room.</p>

<p>This is the less-than-ideal option because it can effectively destroy a conversation, making the migration to chat somewhat useless. If the entire conversation is between two users and you delete all the messages from one user, then all you're migrating is a one-sided conversation with no context.</p>

<h3>Anonymize all messages from users who have the site hidden</h3>

<p>Similar to the previous option, we'll need to look at the user. This time if they have the site set as hidden, we simply won't migrate their user data with the comment when it makes it to the new chat room (will show their plain-text display name with no link to their profile).</p>

<p>Assuming there are no major pitfalls with this solution, it'd be ideal because it preserves all messages and has less chance of breaking a conversation while still preventing the user's identity being revealed in chat. But there may be something I'm not thinking of here.</p>

<hr>

<p>So what am I missing? Anything? Which option would be better for users who utilize the hidden communities feature and why? Or are there other solutions that might work better for this case?</p>

<p>No, we're not adding a site preference so users can choose what happens to their comments in these situations.</p>

<p>If this is the case, am I the only one who thinks this is an idiotic way to do things? It seems to me that if questions are closed as off topic they should (1). actually be off topic and (2). the linked to portion of the help center should be able to tell you why your question is not satisfactory. If questions can be closed for ""violating peer consensus on meta"" then there should be a ""violating peer consensus on meta"" banner with a link to meta. ""off topic"" should not be a term for ""we don't like it for reasons specified in the comments even if it is actually on topic.""</p>

<p>Similar to the ""HNQ boost,"" when an old question gets an edit or a new answer, the post is bumped to the home page of whatever site it's on and may draw additional attention (and votes).  This is perfectly fine, but it's different from receiving an upvote from someone who searched (say, on Google) for that exact question (because they were <em>facing</em> that problem), found the post, and marked it as helpful.</p>

<hr>

<p>I played around with data.stackexchange.com but couldn't work out how to find the dates of upvotes/downvotes.  I know this data must be stored, because it's visible in the ""reputation"" tab on any user account.</p>

group by postid order by count desc

<p>For me personally, this is almost never the desired behaviour. I want to read the contents of the room, joining a room is an entirely separate decision for me. I almost never join a room unless I intend to participate in the discussion.</p>

<p>This behaviour is for one surprising, I don't think everyone expects that they'll be publicly joining a particular chat room just by following a link. This is made even worse by the ""convert comments to chat"" function, which leaves chat links scattered on the main sites. I can't just read the converted comments, I have to join the chat because it's the only link there (unless I manually try to find the room). For me this means that I never actually follow the links to chat unless it's something really important to me.</p>

<p>Joining a chat room is an active action to me, not something that should automatically happen without the user's consent. It has privacy implications, other users get notified that you're looking at that chat room at that specific point in time. It can also provoke reactions, suddenly I'm greeted by someone I don't know because they noticed I entered that room. As I'm a moderator they might also suspect that there is some kind of trouble which caused me to enter that room.</p>

<p>Following a link to a chat room should not automatically make you join that room. The easiest way would be to just redirect to the transcript, but that could be confusing for people that aren't familiar with SE chat. The other option would be to still go to the live chat page, but without joining chat. So the bar at the bottom would have a big ""join this chat room"" button instead of the message box.</p>

<p>My question is <strong>why are there no similar badges for Answers also?</strong> Is it because the question is the one that caused the answers to also be seen?</p>

<p>I suspect that to be able to give those badges we should be able to <em>quantify</em> the views of an answer. Is it ok to assume that if some Question has <code>x</code> views then <em>all</em> answers from that question also have <code>x</code> views? Or only those highly upvoted or accepted?</p>

<p>Another option could be to count the views that Question gained since the posting of that answer, and assign that to be the number of views of a specific answer (this will also prevent new answers on famous posts to instantly get the badge). However I do not know how complex this type of queries could be.</p>

"300056","Why are there two different close reasons for questions that aren't about the site's topic?","<p>On both Meta Stack Exchange and Super User, I noticed that there are two close reasons to choose between when a question isn't about the topic of the site (Stack Exchange on Meta and computers on Super User). There is a ""blatantly off-topic"" reason and a ""not about X within the scope defined in the help center"" reason. These are the two close reasons on Meta Stack Exchange for questions that aren't about Stack Exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not appear to be about the software that powers the Stack Exchange network, within the scope defined in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help"">help center</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blatantly off-topic</strong> (this question has nothing to do with the software that powers the Stack Exchange network)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And these are the close reasons on Super User for questions that aren't about computers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is not about computer hardware or software, within the scope defined <a href=""https://superuser.com/help/on-topic"">in the help center</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blatantly off-topic</strong> (this question has nothing to do with computer software or computer hardware)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/283353/349538"">this answer</a>, the ""blatantly off-topic"" reason is replaced with an ""other"" reason when the user gets the privilege to vote to close. But since there is already another close reason for questions that have nothing to do with the site's topic, I'm not sure it's really necessary to add a ""blatantly off-topic"" reason. I would find it more logical to simply remove that reason for users who don't have the privilege to vote to close.</p>

<p>I just flagged a question on Meta Stack Exchange about hair dryers as off-topic, and I was confused that there were two almost identical close reasons that worked for that question (and for any other question that is not about Stack Exchange). On Stack Overflow, where there is no ""not about programming within the scope defined in the help center"" reason (the reason for that is explained <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/189200/349538"">here</a>), ""blatantly off-topic"" is useful for &lt;3k users so that they can flag questions that are not about programming, but I don't see the use of it on sites like Meta Stack Exchange or Super User that already have a close reason for such questions.</p>

<p>I guess that on Super User, there is a small difference between the two close reasons, since programming questions would fit the first close reason but not necessarily the second one, but I still don't see the need to have two very similar close reasons. And on Meta Stack Exchange, there is almost no difference between the two reasons, either a question is not about Stack Exchange and is off-topic, or it is about Stack Exchange and is either on topic or fits in a different close reason (for example questions about a specific site).</p>

<p>My question is why have a ""blatantly off-topic"" close reason on sites which already have a ""not about X within the scope defined in the help center"" reason? Why not just remove the ""blatantly off-topic"" close reason on such sites for users who have less than 3k reputation? Wouldn't it be less confusing if there was only one close reason for questions that don't have anything to do with the site's topic?</p>

"300197","Bounty-setter can’t comment on bounty question","<p>I know there have been many requests that, once you earn a privilege,
you should keep that privilege forever, even if you drop below
the reputation threshold that granted you that privilege
— especially if you lose the reputation by issuing a bounty. 
I support this request — it seems like a minor code change
to treat privileges like badges, with a bitmap
where bits get set when you reach a threshold and never get unset —
but I know that that request has been consistently declined,
so I’m not making it again.</p>

<p>But I do want to identify an edge case that has not been cited before,
to the best of my recollection. 
This is not a hypothetical scenario; it happened yesterday.</p>

<ol>
<li>Super User question <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/1138045/150988"">Since upgrade from Linux 4.6 to (4.7, 4.8),
%CPU is always 0; the frequency is unknown</a> has been idle for 10 months. 
(The OP, <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/441117/skywalker13"">Skywalker13</a>, did edit it 9 months ago. 
Also, the OP posted an update as an “answer”
the same day he asked the question, and deleted it less than two hours later.)</li>
<li>Yesterday, <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/663451/toyonos"">User ToYonos</a> set a bounty of 100 points on the question
(saying “A detailed canonical answer is required …”,
although the question doesn’t really have <em>any</em> answer
except “don’t use a current version of Linux;
find a version that’s old enough that it doesn’t have the problem,
and use that.”)</li>
<li>ToYonos is a 4½-year veteran of Stack Overflow, with over 7K rep there,
but is relatively new to Super User and has not earned any rep there
(except for the association bonus).</li>
<li>Do the math. 
ToYonos had 101 rep on Super User, so he had “comment everywhere” privilege. 
But he spent 100 rep on the bonus, leaving him with only 1
— so he <em>lost</em> the commenting privilege.  …</li>
<li>… so he can’t comment on the question where he set the bounty. 
If he had thought to do so,
he could have commented on it <em>before</em> he created the bounty; now he can’t.</li>
</ol>

<p>To add insult to injury,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two hours after ToYonos started the bounty,
Super User’s <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/8672/harrymc"">highest reputation user</a> posted <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/1138045/150988#comment1824671_1138045"">a comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@ToYonos: Since you are not the original poster,
  could you please give some details about your problem.
  and why doesn’t the solution in the post fit your case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is especially ironic since, as I said,
there <em>isn’t</em> a constructive answer.</p></li>
<li>ToYonos posted <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/1138045/150988#1244059"">an answer</a> (now 10K-only):

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry I don’t have enough rep here so I will post an answer.</p>
  
  <p>The OP seems to have ""fix"" his issue downgrading to Linux 4.4.33. 
  I don’t want this, I’d rather have an explanation and/or a proper solution.</p>
  
  <p>My issue is quite the same, <code>top</code> giving zeros in <code>%CPU</code> and <code>%MEM</code> columns,
  <code>cpupower frequency-info</code> giving the same result.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Another <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/83283/ramhound"">highly active SU user</a> zapped a couple of comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This should have been submitted as a comment.
  While you are unable to submit comments until you have 50 reputation.
  Commentary submitted as an answer will be deleted by the community.
  Answers and questions which are not well received
  (comments submitted as an answer are not well received)
  count against your ability,
  to submit new questions and answers in the future even if they are deleted</p>
  
  <p>Since you have an issue, its not possible for us to help you,
  so your question will remain unanswered unless you ask your own question. 
  I caution you from asking your question as-is
  because it lacks enough detail to actually answer it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… and ToYonos deleted the answer about half an hour later.</p>

<p>This is adding insult to injury.</p>

<ul>
<li>As I said, ToYonos <em>had</em> over 100 rep,
and he <em>had</em> “comment everywhere” privilege, before he set the bounty.</li>
<li>“Since you have an issue, its not possible for us to help you, …” 
Huh?  Why not? 
ToYonos isn’t asking people to answer his answer;
he’s asking them to answer <strong><em>Skywalker13’s question</strong>.</em></li>
<li>“I caution you from asking your question as-is
because it lacks enough detail to actually answer it.” 
Yeah, sure, if you look at ToYonos’s “answer” as if it were a question,
then it’s not answerable. 
But ToYonos is asking people to answer Skywalker13’s question,
which is over 150 lines (over 1000 words) long
(although about 70% of that is output from commands). 
It seems to be detailed enough.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary,</p>

<ul>
<li>ToYonos has earned the privilege to post comments. 
He has earned that and more on Stack Overflow,
and he subsequently earned it by association on Super User when he joined.</li>
<li>Arguably, ToYonos has invested more in this question than anybody else. 
(OK, Skywalker13 (the OP) may have invested more time and energy,
but ToYonos has invested 100 points of rep.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can always comment on your own posts. 
Setting a bounty on a question
should give you enough of a stake in that question
to allow you to comment on that question, as if you had asked it.</p>

From my post, here is what the current close text states:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/NyfdU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/NyfdU.png"" alt=""Close reason Text""></a></p>

<p>My proposal was to have it changed to something that refers to editing the question to be more clear and allow for it to be reopened.  My suggestion was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question has been asked before and already has an answer. If those answers do not fully address your question, or if your question is actually different than the duplicate, [please edit your question] to be more clear and allow for it to be reopened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where the part within the [ ] would be a link to the edit page for the question.  It is to my understanding that usually we don't recommend people to ask a new question but to rather edit the current one and allow for it to be reopened. In fact, most of the time when someone asks a new question, it's flagged as a duplicate of the duplicate (at least over on Arqade).  The reason I ask this here, is because I flagged my post for a moderator to view it and have the changed implemented/submitted to SE, but they said it's an Exchange wide close reason, and that we couldn't change it. </p>

<p>So, should we reword the closure text for duplicate questions or is asking a new question the proper protocol?  </p>

We did have a mod on duty if we accidentally triggered an auto flag (I think one was triggered but it was dismissed before anyone else saw it). I couldn't make rooms after that due to kicking (I found that out later), I asked Dennis to fix it which he did (since it was a false alarm auto-ban). </p>

<p>If you compare the design to the old top bar, the old reputation count is not bold, and it is much clearer. Also, the font size is 13px instead of 12px, and that one pixel does make a difference. The white colored text also stands out more than the silver or bronze colored text.

On one site, we have instant access to our ""inbox"", network sites, and so forth. On every other site, you have to scroll up to the top of the page to see that.</p>

The inbox indicator in the top bar feels a lot smaller and less contrasted than the old one. They have the same color, but the new one is smaller and I think its placement makes it more discrete.</p>

<p>Side by side in isolation the difference doesn't seem so much, but the old one is a bit bigger, and it's alone in the bar rather than superposed over the <strike>square bra</strike> in-tray graphic, which makes it stand out a lot more.</p>

<pre><code>.topbar .icon-inbox .unread-count {

    text-indent: 0;
    border-radius: 2px;

"301427","Is there a way to get just my privilege to (in)validate flags in chat revoked?","<p>Because I have 40.3K rep across all Stack Exchange sites, I get that blue orb above my avatar whenever someone flags something in chat, with the options to validate or invalidate a chat flag.</p>

<p>I don't want that pressure. I don't have the social capabilities to judge whether a flag is valid or not, especially in those cases where there is no clear violation of chat rules. Something like curses or offensive language I can just about judge that it's a valid flag. But more often than not, I simply cannot personally judge whether the flag is valid or invalid, and I feel like it's a waste of a potential flag judging to let me judge them. Especially considering the ""Not sure"" option actually is closer to ""a little bit invalid"" than it is to ""don't ask me"".</p>

<p>On top of that, there is the issue of emotional instability. Due to the inherent nature of a feature used to moderate offensive messages, nearly every message which appears in a blue orb is offensive content. People who use offensive language, or who voice racist or sexist opinions, or showcase political extremism.</p>

<p>I don't want to see stuff like that. The world right now is going through some rough patches, with terrorism, political extremism and highly flammable rhetoric from many sides. I'm already emotionally much more susceptible to bad news, and my happy/sad scale rarely measures above the neutral level. I'm not depressed, mind you, but I'm not happy either. I use the Bridge, the chat room I am a regular of, as a sort-of refuge from the worst of what's happening out there. </p>

<p>Having those offensive messages from the flags appear on my screen on a regular level confronts me with the negative sides of the world, and it moves my scale closer to the sad level. I fear that too much of that negative stuff will make me sad, and eventually depressed. I obviously don't want that.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can say ""stop giving me flag requests, because I can't handle them, both in the ""I don't know what to do with them"" and the ""they're too much for me to handle mentally"" senses""?</p>

If the post had been deleted by flags that would make sense -- rescinding the flags should rescind their consequences.  But the deletion here was unrelated.  The author wanted the post to be deleted and it ended up undeleted.

  <p>Your account meets a threshold that requires manual review by a community manager before being deleted. This review may take longer than 24 hours but will be done as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Optional, ""Thank you for your patience."" or something like that.</p>

<p>Additionally, it seems that the count down restarts from 24 hours after the first 24 is over. It would also be worth noting in the message that, if the review is done after the initial 24 hour period, they will still have until the end of the new count down before their account is removed (if that's the case) or if the account will be removed immediately upon review, let them know that, too.</p>

"302019","Can we add a reputation penalty to comments that are removed for being Rude or Abusive?","<p>Many sites have issues with users abusing comments to violate the be nice policy.  Currently other than the occasional warning or suspension there is no real deterrent.  The lack of any noticeable penalty, I suspect, fuels the willingness of these users to engage in the disruptive behavior that Mods are forced to deal with.</p>

<p>If a comment is removed for being rude or abusive, a penalty of 25 rep being applied would be a good reminder that this behavior is not acceptable, and provide a tangible penalty for misbehavior.  In addition if these changes were visible to other users, they might choose not to engage in comment banter with someone who has a track record of disruptive comments.  In the end both of these results are a win for both moderators and the community.</p>

<p>This would also have a positive effect for Hot Network Questions where users not normally engaged with the community, have the ability to comment snark and engage in disruptive comment behavior.  Just a few instances of misbehavior in this manner would see their ability to comment revoked until such time as they provide a positive contribution to the community.</p>

"302022","Chat flags for room owners?","<p>Recently it happened that a familiar high-reputation user from another room came into one where I am RO and notified me that there were flagged messages. I thought that if you were in a room and supposed to keep it clean would be able to see flags as well to be notified about stuff that should not be there.<br>
The high-rep user informed me that one needs to be above 10k reputation or moderator to see flags (or has to have it raised in the first place). </p>

<p>While checking for duplicates my first stop has been the post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271267/a-guide-to-moderating-chat"">A guide to moderating chat</a> where it reads as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you flag a message as spam/offensive, the flag will draw the attention of other high-reputation community members, as well as moderators. In both cases, they’ll be asked to determine if the flag is valid or not</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I support the reputation threshhold I wondered why roomowners would be excluded from the flag notification. And if that would be too much it should at least be visible for the room owners that currently are paying attention.  </p>

<p>I could not find any negative consequences while thinking about it</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Noone would be super annoyed (mods and high-rep users already get notified) because the flags would be visible or there would be a notification for flags in rooms someone is owner of.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides RO with a little bit more information about what is happening. It is kinda strange to see ""a lot"" of people rushing into a room because there was something flagged and have no clue what happened.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The trigger message (by a user who joined the chat for the first time) was something along the lines of ""service/framework XY is dumb as fuck"" (cannot quote the exact message because it was removed and I moved the message to one of the bins) if that was relevant. I did not see it as an offending message so I did nothing furtheron. Only after said user joined, I moved it.</p>

<p>To make my question(s) clear: Why are the flags in a room not at least shown to the room owners? Is that something one could/should implement?</p>

<p>(Tagging this discussion for now, because I am unaware of potential other pros/cons from users that are more experienced with the network)</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the page for a question, any question, any question at all.</li>
<li>Open the same question in an additional tab, or coordinate with an additional user to do so.</li>
<li>In the second tab, make an edit to the question.</li>
<li>In the first tab, note that the ""an edit has been made"" bar appears at the top. <em>Do not dismiss this.</em></li>
<li>In the first tab, click the ""flag"" action link below the question text. <strong>Expected result:</strong> Flag dialog should open. <strong>Observed behavior:</strong> The question text is refreshed with the edit, but the flag dialog does not open.</li>
<li>In the first tab, immediately click the ""flag"" action link again. <strong>Observed behavior:</strong> An error message appears that you can only open the flag dialog once every three seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The workaround</strong> is easy: just wait those few seconds and try again.</p>

<p><strong>I'm suggesting</strong> that instead of as observed in step 5 above, the text should be refreshed and a message should be displayed to the user encouraging them to reconsider the flag in light of the edit now visible, but that this does not count as actually opening the flag dialog.</p>

<p>I edited <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/966037/how-do-i-make-python-2-the-default-with-anaconda"">this question</a> from the <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/review/low-quality-posts/765718"">LQP review queue</a>, but realized I had missed some things in the edit, so I opened up the page and clicked <em>edit</em> to re-edit it. This was well within the 5 minute editing window, so if no one else had edited the post before I submitted the re-edit, then it would have been correct for the system to have shown both my edits as a single revision. However, that's not quite what happened.</p>

<p>As I was <em>re</em>-editing the post, <em>just</em> as I was clicking the button to submit the edit, the bar about how someone else had edited the post came up. After I submitted my edit, I checked the post and the revision history to see if I needed to merge any changes in from that other edit. That's when I saw something weird: both <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/posts/966037/revisions"">the revision history</a> and <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/posts/966037/timeline"">the post timeline</a> show the other user's edit (edit #3) as the most recent edit, but my edit is what the post actually shows.</p>

<p>This is to say that <strong><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/966037/how-do-i-make-python-2-the-default-with-anaconda"">what the question page shows</a> as the post body is <em>different text</em> from <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/revisions/966037/3"">the text of what is currently listed as the most recent revision</a></strong>. In case the post is edited again, destroying the publicly viewable evidence of the bug, I've <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20171018164917/https://askubuntu.com/questions/966037/how-do-i-make-python-2-the-default-with-anaconda"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">archived the page in the Wayback Machine</a>. The other editor, <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/527764/zanna"">Zanna</a>, is shown on the question page as the most recent editor--which agrees with the revision history page--but the text on the question page that it (in effect) attributes to her is actually from <em>my</em> edit, which the revision history claims happened earlier.</p>

<p>Since this is sort of confusing, I should probably say what behavior I actually <em>expect</em> and would  consider correct in this situation. <strong>The bug here is that the revision history disagrees with the question page--the latest revision is not the same text as is shown on that page.</strong> Any specific way a conflict in this situation could be resolved that abides by that would be basically fine. However, the specific results I expected to see was for either <em>(a)</em> my re-edit to be recorded as revision #4, effectively rolling back Zanna's edit that occurred while I was editing, or <em>(b)</em> my re-edit to not be applied at all.</p>

<p><a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40619964#40619964"">This is what Zanna, the other editor, observed</a>:</p>

<p>But what if they aren't? Look for example at <a href=""https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/319495"">gaming question 319495</a>. There is an already accepted answer will all the information that is needed and it has a good quality (as good as it gets for a bad question). Then someone recently dug up that question and put part of the information from the first answer into his own answer, added a needlessly complicated way to do the other thing that was already in the first answer and spiced it all up with bad grammar.</p>

<p>That answer added nothing useful to the already accepted answer. The current thing I do in that case is to say that in a comment and downvote the answer. Editing is not useful, because there already is an accepted answer with all information in it, flagging on the other hand is not really possible in a good way, because there is no ""duplicate answer"" flag reason. I could flag it as ""very low quality"", but that is intended for answers that are so bad that they can't be rescued by editing, which this could, but shouldn't.</p>

<p>If it gets enough downvotes, the text becomes a bit more grey, but otherwise nothing happens, it just stays there. Duplicate questions have a big banner onto them and the title gets changed, but answers just stay where they are, if they are at least understandable. So what should I do?</p>

<ul>
<li>Endure that they will stay there?</li>
<li>Flag them as very low quality, even if the quality is ok?</li>
<li>Flag as in need of moderator intervention? That should usually not be used for such common cases.</li>

I was appearing on the head of the queue until a moment ago when a user just logged in and appeared, mysteriously, on the head of <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/review"">this same queue</a>. But the problem is that there is no late answer posted either before, or after he logged in, and his review history shows the last post he reviewed was <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/120114/sam-onela?tab=activity"">16 hours ago</a> (by the time this question is written).</p>

<p>My question: where is this late answers that I did not see? Deleted by the owner? No, it is an impossible scenario as I have been online and nothing like that happened.</p>

<p>The user appears on the head of that queue whenever he finds himself not on that position.</p>

<p>I recently posted a question about this exact thing but I deleted it after a user said it must be a late answer deleted by its owner (which scenario I did not believe in as it simply did not occur).</p>

<p>One example:<br></p>

<h1>This is a headline.</h1>

<p>The vertical space visually connecting a headline to the previous paragraph is shorter than the vertical space relating it to the following content. But the following content and the headline form one semantic unit. At least in my reasoning they should be.</p>

<p>Looks to me as if visual layout units are disrupting semantic content units.</p>

<p>Shouldn't this be the other way around – more space separating the previous content a from such an element of order, and optically less space than that to unify headline and following content?</p>

<p>I haven't counted the pixels, but to me it looks as if baselines or x-height are used to calculate equidistance and the effect I see is caused by optically protruding elements?</p>

  <p>This removal occurs whenever a user is deleted, unless that user had a very high reputation score. Because high-reputation users have usually cast a great many votes, removing all of them could be that much more disruptive to other users.</p>

  <li>Number of people affected significantly by those votes</li>

<p>My suggestion: <strong>Please allow badges like ""Reviewer"" to be chosen as the next badge on the profile page.</strong></p>

<p>How it would work: Instead of adding an additional UI to choose the review queue this should show the progress for, it could just track the highest progress of a badge that you don't yet have.<br>
For example, if someone did 300 ""First posts"" reviews, 200 ""Late answers"" reviews, 100 ""Suggested edits"" reviews and 0 of all other reviews, then it would show a progress of 200, because for ""first posts"" the user already got the badge and the 200 ""late answers"" reviews are the most progress he has for the other ""reviewer"" badges. Maybe it could also display the badge title as ""Reviewer (Late answers)"".</p>

"303659","Deleting an account retains reputation and badges for linked chat accounts","<p>I deleted my account on codegolf.stackexchange.com some time ago. The vast majority of my network reputation was derived from that site (I had approximately 20k rep when I deleted the account).</p>

<p>However, when I look at <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/users/246227"">my account on chat.stackexchange.com</a>, it's showing 22k reputation and six gold badges. These can only possibly have come from codegolf (I don't have nearly enough activity on other sites for that).</p>

<p>It seems like a major bug to retain this information; I can't see any good reason why a user should be credited for posts that they're no longer associated with. (It also concerns me that deleted accounts aren't being deleted ""properly"", e.g. I still have notifications from PPCG in my notifications list.) Note that part of the reason I deleted the account was to remove badges from it, and remove reputation from it without needing to use the disruptive method of continuously posting bounties, and as such I'm quite concerned that the reputation and bounties are still indirectly there.</p>

<p>Note also that it would probably be possible to use this mechanism to bypass the reputation cap; you could make a post, earn 200 reputation from it, delete your account on a particular site (as you still only have one post), create another account on the same site, earn another 200 reputation, and get a total of 400 ""global"" reputation. This would seem to violate the purpose of the reputation cap. (If this seems implausible – although in my experience, it's normally fairly easy to gain large amounts of reputation if you're merely aiming to gain reputation rather than to improve the site – consider instead the situation with bronze badges; you could create an account on a particular site, edit your profile to gain the badge, delete the account again, and repeat arbitrarily many times in order to gain arbitrarily many bronze badges.)</p>

<p>(See also <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/266479/association-bonus-is-still-awarded-if-accounts-are-deleted"">this question</a>, reporting a similar bug that affects the ""can gain association bonuses"" property of a global account, as opposed to the global badges and global reputation.)</p>

"303676","How can I get all-time stats for migrations from my site?","<p>One of my sites is discussing adding a custom migration path to a site we have overlap with.  As a moderator I wanted to get some data about past migrations to inform that discussion.  I didn't find a way to get all-time totals per destination.  I can count -- by hand! -- all of the outbound migrations for a destination, and I can see a summary of migrations and how many were rejected for the last 90 days only.  For questions older than 90 days, I can't see aggregate information and the only way to find out about rejections is to click through on each one to look.</p>

<p>Is there some way for a moderator to get the same kind of data we get on the 90-days page, but for longer?  Ideally we'd be able to enter a date range, but if that's hard then just having the all-time list would be helpful in discussions like this.  (A date range would have been helpful in my case so we could limit the stats to migrations since the candidate target site was created.)  A 90-day period doesn't provide enough data to be meaningful on smaller sites.</p>

<p>I'm not asking for something to be implemented (this is an infrequent need and there are things I'd much rather the developers be working on).  I'm hoping there's a way to do it with tools already in place (which includes SEDE, but since migration stubs get deleted after 30 days I don't know if that helps).</p>

But still, after that discussion I was curious whether one user has a possibility to share his favorite tags with another user in some more comfortable way than taking a screenshot or typing/copypasting the list of tags.</p>

<p>Likewise, when visiting the chat home page, <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com"">chat.stackexchange.com</a>, I appear logged in, with my user card appearing in the top bar.</p>

<p>However, when visiting other pages on chat, I'm shown as logged out. My user card does not show up in the top bar, but instead a link to log in. Neither do I have access to moderator tooling, such as tools on user profiles, or the list of recent flags.</p>

<p>After some digging, I have come up with a solution and a possible cause: cookies. When I am <strong>correctly</strong> logged in, I get the following cookies from <code>chat.stackexchange.com</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sechatusr</code></li>
<li><code>x</code></li>
</ul>

<p>When I am <strong>incorrectly</strong> shown as logged out, I have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.ASPXBrowserOverride</code></li>
<li><code>_ga</code></li>
<li><code>__qca</code></li>
<li><code>sechatusr</code></li>
<li><code>sechatusr</code> (not a typo, I have two of these)</li>
<li><code>acct</code></li>
<li><code>prov</code></li>
<li><code>x</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect <code>acct</code> and <code>prov</code> have something to do with the SE OpenID login I use; <code>_ga</code> is a Google Analytics cookie; <code>.ASPXBrowserOverride</code> is from ASP.NET, and <code>__qca</code> is the Quantcast analytics cookie. Deleting all of these, along with one of the double <code>sechatusr</code> cookies, resolves the problem: I'm logged in everywhere.</p>

I've earned the hat on four sites so far, three initially and the fourth today when I crossed that reputation threshold.  So it appears that the hat isn't a one-time award; once you have it, other sites get added when you meet the requirement there.</p>

<p>As of today I've earned 165 reputation during Winter Bash on Mi Yodeya (or 167 if the +2 for accepting an answer counts).  However, during that time a user was deleted, costing me 20 rep.  It's been more than an hour since the last rep increase, which is longer than it usually takes for hats to show up, and I have not received the hat.</p>

<p>^^^ as you see, I just said hello in Spanish and nothing happened, despite ""Saludos"" means ""<strong>greetings</strong>"" in Spanish.</p>

<p>In Spanish Stack Exchange <a href=""https://spanish.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2760/1674"">we noticed</a> that a post cannot start with something as normal as ""<strong>Hay</strong>"", which in English can be considered a greeting, but in Spanish just means ""<strong>there are</strong>"" and seems to be a perfectly valid word to start a post with :)</p>

<p>All of this comes from the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93989/209901"">automatic removal of salutations</a> that Stack Exchange has in place, which performs some checks and removes those strings that match this regex:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>^                 # begins at start of body
\s*               # possible spaces
(
hii?(?![a-z])|    # any of these greeting words
hello|
h(e|a)y(?![a-z])|
dear|
greetings|
hai|

howdy|
h(i|e)ya|

<p>At the same time, we seem to somehow know if a post is in English or not by using the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/94526/209901""><em>English threshold</em></a>.</p>

<p>All of this taken into consideration, could we have language specific automatic removal of salutations so clear greetings in other languages are removed, while perfectly valid non-greeting words are preserved? Of course, I mean this for the languages that currently have a site.</p>

"305211","Issues with management of chat account profiles and chat parents","<p>I'm poking around doing some moderator-y stuff and I'm hitting a dead end because one of the chat users I'm trying to investigate have a deleted account as their chat parent. Because of this, I can't see their network account at all.</p>

<p>They still have chat reputation - so I'm assuming they still have <em>an</em> account on the network somewhere because, according to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/283432/284336"">this 2016 answer from Shog9</a>, once all site accounts are removed, so too is the chat account.</p>

<p>So, there are really a few problems here...</p>

<ol>
<li>I can't get to a network account to see all of their site memberships.</li>
<li>The system should not allow users to have a deleted account as a chat parent.</li>
<li>Deleting an account should deduct the reputation lost when doing so without requiring the user to visit chat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Point one is addressed in this <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/270015/provide-a-network-profile-link-on-chat"">2015 Feature Request</a> asking for a network account link. Additionally, this seems like a good solution for this issue as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/127993/284336"">balpha admitted back in 2012</a> that for chat.SE, the concept of a ""Chat Parent"" is pretty much obsolete, so linking to the Network profile <em>instead</em> or <em>in addition</em> would be helpful. I do recognize that the chat parent is used for some things, such as denoting moderator accounts and possibly suspending a chat account along with a site suspension.</p>

<p>Point two is a known issue from 2012 that doesn't seem to be fixed, likely because chat is (understandably) not particularly high-priority, though a couple of moderators have asked for updates in both <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/129289/what-should-happen-to-a-chat-account-after-the-parent-account-was-deleted#comment783102_129385"">2014</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126840/chat-user-has-no-parent-user#comment902341_126936"">2016</a>. It's also something that Monica Cellio encouraged in a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/277747/284336"">related answer</a> to a question about deleting chat accounts with a deleted chat parent account.</p>

<p>Point three seems to require the user actually visiting chat again after deleting their account for it to be updated, based on a recent <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303659/deleting-an-account-retains-reputation-and-badges-for-linked-chat-accounts#comment987245_303659"">comment from animuson here</a>, so whether or not the user has any reputation is in limbo until they visit chat, which makes it impossible to tell whether they have any accounts on the network or not... again making point one valuable. As a note, I've attempted to refresh the user's chat profile but it had no effect on either their chat parent or reputation, perhaps it should? This would be an easy way for moderators to update the chat account status.</p>

<p>In writing this, I've learned a lot about how chat profiles are managed and mismanaged and I hope that collecting it here helps others... but I'd really love it if this became obsolete because we addressed the concerns here, some of which are pretty long standing, particularly points one and two.</p>

<p>All good so far.</p>

<p>However, when a question that was closed as duplicate and its duplicates list has been edited is reopened, the duplicates list is not cleared. This means that if the question is then closed again as a duplicate, it will show the list of duplicates instead of starting from a clean slate.</p>

<p>This can be seen in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/posts/305223/revisions"">revisions list</a> of the above question:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In this specific case I agreed with the original closure so the list is still good, but in other cases, question might be wrongly closed as duplicate of other questions, reopened, closed as duplicate of the actual source, but still be duplicate of that wrong list of questions.</p>

<p>I really think that reopening should clear that list.</p>

<p>The two main points for improvement I suggest are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When there are lots of flags on a post and the overlay is at its tallest, it obscures a lot of the page on my laptop screen, rendering the page difficult to actually moderate on. Along with this, the option to ""close"" the overlay gets rid of it completely and requires refreshing the page to bring it back.</p></li>
<li><p>The overlay forces mods to be mods first rather than giving us a chance to be normal users... there's no way to make the ""closed"" status sticky while browsing so when you're on a site that gets a lot of flags, many posts bug you to act, often on stuff you're choosing <em>not</em> to act on immediately.</p></li>

<p>For reference: my laptop screen is 900 px high (2011 15 inch MBP). It seems like the overlay is fixed to a max height of about 415 px (purple bar). That means the red bar is whatever space <em>isn't</em> used up by:</p>

<ul>
<li>the menu bar (not shown), </li>
<li>browser tabs</li>
<li>browser toolbar</li>
<li>other stuff?</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves (in my case) <em>less</em> than 415 px - about 400 px - for the actual page content.</p>

<hr>

<p>How can this be fixed? For item one, I can think of a couple of options, both are giving us the option to minimize/collapse/resize the overlay:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace ""close"" with ""minimize"" or ""▼"". Clicking on this would reduce the height of the overlay to about the same height as the top bar (~40-50 px) and it would show only the forward and back arrows and ""open"" or ""▲"" to reopen the overlay. Something like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0SXDA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0SXDA.png"" alt=""Example of how collapsed overlay would look""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Make it possible to resize the overlay (grab and drag the top up and down) so that mods can choose how tall it is with a minimum height that would snap to Something similar to the option above.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could implement both of these together, too... though that may be a bit much... but useful.</p>

<p>Now, making the browser <strong>remember</strong> the setting last used for this (open/collapsed/specifically sized) would make item two possible without having to have a setting for it. I really enjoy moderating the sites I'm a moderator on but sometimes it'd be nice to just turn off the moderation features so that I can focus on actually using the site... I can't imagine what it's like for staff who have diamonds everywhere on the network.</p>

<p>I wouldn't mind a 50 px bar on the bottom of the screen that indicates there are flags on a question <em>without</em> showing me the flags. If I want to look at them, I can see they're there and investigate but it's possible I might not notice them at all if I'm just trying to use the site.</p>

<hr>

<p>If this is scriptable, I'll take that, too. I know this probably wouldn't be a high priority request.</p>

<p>The new mobile menu on all SE sites is open all the time in older web browsers (even directly when you navigate to the page).</p>

<p>I found that the issue is caused by the CSS-property called <code>transform</code>, underlined in the screenshot below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/siUza.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/siUza.png"" alt=""The &#39;transform&#39; property is the cause""></a></p>

<p>Older browsers (like Safari 6.0 in iOS 6) do not support the standard <code>transform</code> property. Instead, some of them support prefixed versions of it (from <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-webkit-transform</code> (older versions of Safari, Chrome and Opera)</li>
<li><code>-moz-transform</code> (older versions of Firefox)</li>
<li><code>-ms-transform</code> (Internet Explorer 9)</li>

<p>I suggest these three properties to be added to the CSS as well, for compatibility with older browsers.</p>

On all of them except one, the font size used for question titles on the main page looks consistent.  Then there's Beer, Wine, &amp; Spirits, where things are a little smaller.  No, it's not just blurry vision from imbibing. </p>

<p>To eliminate variables for this question, I'll compare this site specifically to another beta site.  Even if there is any per-site styling in the mobile theme, all beta sites use the same style.  Here they are, side by side:</p>

<p>It's not a large difference, but you can see that both the text size and the line spacing in the titles are smaller in the screen shot on the left.</p>

<p>Browser text scaling is set to 110%.  That's a browser-wide setting.  I have no site-specific or tab-specific modifications on either site.  This difference has existed for months; it's not a consequence of the recent, now-reverted changes to the mobile site.</p>

<p>Why the difference?  It's not a big deal (or a big difference), but I can't figure out why one site should be different from another when they all use the same theme and the same browser.</p>

Now I don't really mind the downvotes, as everyone can vote as he or she pleases, however it got me thinking if I'm doing things the wrong way. </p>

<p>As far as I understand the system, comments are for asking clarification questions and answers are where you put your answer in. The whole reputation system works around this assumption. Also from a usability point of view burying the answer in a thread of comments which is only shown after some clicking doesn't seem right either.</p>

<p>Most of that is still true, but today private beta sites <em>do</em> show up on the network profile.  Here's an <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/users/34933/robert-cartaino?tab=accounts"">example</a>:</p>

"306253","Let's Start An Annual Meta Survey!","<p>No, we're not going to survey a survey, as much fun as that might be. We'd like to toss out the idea of running a survey that asks folks about their experiences here, expectations when coming here, and whatever else they'd like to add. </p>

<p>This was brought on by an idea some users had surrounding an unofficial survey that was being shown to folks that appeared to be in the wrong place by coming to meta. While it's nice to know how folks occasionally get lost, we thought it would be a better idea to take that energy, give the end result more breadth and usefulness, and see if we can find areas where we could make some small improvements that might lead to a larger impact.</p>

<p>It's important that all of us, occasionally, see some new faces with 1500 or more rep starting to chime in. That means new folks are coming in to fill the spaces left by those that have done, well, basically all they came here to do. </p>

<p>So, some early specifics (this is still just an idea at this point, although it looks like an idea that's easy enough to go with unless anyone can bring up a good reason not go proceed):</p>

<h3>Base mechanics:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Survey would be informal, most likely done through Google forms, and completely anonymous. No badges, no place to put your email or profile link.</p></li>
<li><p>Survey would be delivered in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>50% of people asking questions could see an automatic link to it (similar to what we did with some ask question page data gathering on SO) after they ask their first question here on MSE</li>
<li>Canned comments with a link to the survey would be provided so users could let others know it exists (allowing for limited sampling on all child meta sites)</li>
<li>A featured meta post could show up in the community bulletin for a few days</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>That keeps it pretty simple. We could re-use some stuff we've already got in our testing facility to prompt folks to take it after their first interaction here, and folks could use some <em>excruciatingly</em> polite canned comments that we provide to ask others if they'd be interested in participating. </p>

<h3>So, what do we hope to learn through the survey?</h3>

<p>As I noted initially, <em>expectations</em> that folks have when coming here are the primary and most interesting thing to learn, as well as the hardest to guess in some cases. It will also give us an opportunity to hopefully hear more from those that come here, get frustrated, and just never come back again.</p>

<p>Sure, we want to find out how folks end up in the wrong places (we're sure we can confirm it's accidentally-ooops-on-purposely-ish), and while that's good signal to have, the usefulness of it is quite limited. What's <em>most</em> useful to determine is what might be keeping folks that ask a few good questions here from asking (or, better) <em>answering</em> dozens more.</p>

<h3>And, what do we hope to get from this post?</h3>

<p>We want any ideas you have surrounding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Questions you think would be useful to ask (multiple choice, or short sentence answers preferably)</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any problems we haven't thought of? </p></li>
<li><p>Any questions I didn't answer so far in this post?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let us know. Ideally we could launch this within the next 30 - 45 days and (if it seemed useful) it could become a more annual thing. And just to be clear, we're not trying to find out more about <em>you</em>, we're trying to find out more about your expectations when it comes to participating beyond asking / answering and moderating on the main sites.</p>

<p>We'll take care of the more rote questions (expectations vs what happened, how happy are you with [x] on a scale of 1 - 10, etc) - but notes on stuff we should take care not to forget would be appreciated. </p>

"306467","Put correct answer in the question or edit the accepted answer?","<p>Let's say I have a problem (this is quite common) and ask on one of the Stack sites. There are a few answers, but none of them are really great. Eventually, after some back and forth in the comment section of one of the answers the question gets answered (Let's say a linked blog post did the trick).</p>

<p>I accept the answer since it clearly is the best one and even if it didn't resolve my issue directly, it clearly helped me to do so. But now I know how this is done right (putting all this information together) and I'd like to share this knowledge. What should I do? Here are the options that come to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit the accepted answer. But the difference might be that big that it would be more a rewrite than an improvement of the answer. I don't like editing other people's stuff in such an invasive way. If the original answer is close enough, I usually do this though.</li>
<li>Put the thing that worked for into the question. I've seen this now and then and even if it's not great, I could live with it.</li>
<li>Add an own answer with my solution. The problem here is that it might get lost and not get the attention it deserves. I could link it from the question or the comments though.</li>
<li>Add my own answer and accept it. This resolves the visibility issue, but it kind of feels like stealing reputation from the person that did the original answering work.</li>

"306779","Mod Tooling for comments UI improvement suggestions","<p>I am going through the moderator tooling over the next [timeframe] and create some feature requests that I think would improve the UI a bit. I have more radical suggestions for a complete overhaul, but I imagine that's going to be even more work than the number of UI things I'll be posting. (Screenshots are intentionally <em>not</em> inline on this post, as there are many of them)</p>

<p>This post deals with <strong>flagged comments</strong>. </p>

<p>There are several different flags that can appear in the moderator queue that want us to deal explicitly with a comment or group of comments. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comment Flag - No Longer Needed</li>
<li>Comment Flag - Rude/Abusive</li>
<li>Comment Flag - Other</li>
<li>Automatic ""Too many comments"" flag</li>
<li>Post Flag - Other</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>In the Comment Flags, we are presented with a list of comments that have been flagged. Each flag contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A link to the question or answer</li>
<li>The time the post was made and the author of the post (not the comment)</li>
<li>A link to the comment, the author of the comment, and the type of flag</li>
<li>The text of the comment</li>
<li>The option to delete, edit or dismiss</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Suggestion 1: Don't move the options to deal with a comment around</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/AHkcN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 1</a> | <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/AtMbp.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 2</a> | <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/gnWQE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 3</a></p>

<p>Many comments are flagged as no longer needed because they are ""I edited the post"", ""Thanks!"", ""please accept"" type comments. These can be dealt with easily by putting the mouse over ""delete"" and clicking.</p>

<p>The problem is, the ""delete"" option moves. If you misclick and hit the text of the comment, you are dropped into a text box to edit the comment.</p>

<p>These buttons move for multiple reasons. </p>

<ul>
<li>The comments you've recently handled populate the top of the page (Screenshot 1, label ""A""). This is a rotating window of the 20 most recently handled comments since page load, I believe.</li>
<li>The length of the title pushes down the user card, which pushes down the options to handle the flag. This kicks in after you've dealt with  20 comments. (Screenshot 1, label ""B"" and Screenshot 2)</li>
<li>Previous moderator actions on the question add more data to the flag (Screenshot 3), which push down the options further. </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these break the work flow of quickly eliminating comments and require constant readjustment of the mouse to hit the delete button again. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Suggestion 2: Add more context to the flag queue</h2>

<p>The ""no longer needed"" flag is great when it's obvious. ""I edited my answer"" is nice and clear. ""Please add [block of code], because [reasons]"" is not. At least not without leaving the flag queue and looking at the post to see if [block of code] was added. An example can be seen in <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Eg61T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 4</a>. ""Please edit your question to contain [mcve]"". This is a valuable comment until that edit takes place, then it'd obsolete. Unfortunately, from the flag queue, I can't see that an edit ever occurred. I need to go to the question and a.) See if it was ever edited and b.) Make a best guess on whether it is minimal. </p>

<p>Moderator guidance tells me that second part shouldn't be needed. In all honesty, unless it's a technology I am familiar with, I don't usually do part B. I just compare flag time vs edit time. </p>

<p>If we could get an indication that the post has been edited by the original poster that'd be helpful. Ideally, an edit for something like <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Eg61T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 4</a>'s flag would take place after the comment was posted and before the comment was flagged as no longer needed.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Suggestion 3: Make Purging comments easier</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/KLEtK.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 5</a></p>

<p>Unless a moderator uses one of the user scripts floating around, purging an entire comment chain at once is hidden behind the ""mod"" button. Even worse, when flags are raised to purge a thread, they can either show up on the post itself or on a single comment in the thread. Neither of which show context.</p>

<p>In screenshot 5, you can see a single comment was flagged but requests the entire thread be purged. To do so, I need to a.) visit the post b.) determine if all comments should be purged c.) either delete the comments one at a time or click ""mod->purge all comments"" (or use a user script the pulls that option out of the menu. </p>

<p>If we had the option to purge from the flag queue <em>and</em> show/handle sibling comments, that'd be very helpful. If this could be combined with Suggestion 4 to allow us to either purge or move to chat after handling the entire thread in the queue, that'd be even better.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Suggestion 4: Complete the Move to Chat feature</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/CS1Rw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 6</a></p>

<p>Automatic flags are raised on posts that have received 25+ comments in under 3 days. From the flag queue I have the option to move these to chat (yay!), but this option tells me that comments still need to be deleted separately. That's...unfortunate. That means that I still need to go visit the post to clean up. </p>

<p>However, if I move comments to chat from the post itself, I'm presented with the option to also purge comments during the move. This option should be available from the flag queue as well. Combined with Suggestion 3's ability to see and handle sibling comments, this would make cleaning up long threads a lot faster.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Suggestion 5: Consistent button layout between too chatty questions and answers</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/3N72y.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screenshot 7</a></p>

<p>When an automatic flag is raised, the difference between questions and answers is an extra button and a second row. On top of that, the ""No further action"" button is in a different position (first vs second). Can these be made consistent and all on a single line?</p>

<h2>Suggestion 6: Remove the click comment to edit default action</h2>

<p>As mentioned in Suggestion 1, if you click on the text of a comment (or misclick and hit the white space around it) you are dropped into a text box to edit the comment. I can't recall a time I've ever edited a comment posted by another user. </p>

<p>When you do this click, the ""dismiss"" option disappears, moving the ""Delete"" and ""edit"" links over to the right. </p>

<p>Editing comments should be pretty rare. Can we make editing only available when you click the ""edit"" link? Additionally, can we not remove the ""dismiss"" link? </p>

<hr>

<p>On Stack Overflow we've deleted roughly 20K comments in the past month. This doesn't include anything automatically flagged by my <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354719/should-moderators-run-automated-bots-under-their-accounts"">bot</a>. I stopped that process back in October, so that is 20K comments that have been brought to our attention by the community.</p>

<p>Comments are lower on the priority list of things that need to be dealt with, but there is still a lot of them that need to be handled.</p>

"306851","Why do we need 150 users with 200+ rep in beta?","<p>When we look at statistics of any beta sites, some stats will be displayed. The stats are displayed to reflect the health of the beta like Needs work, Okay and excellent are given. It is believed (not sure) that the stats are also one of many factors considered while considering a beta site for graduation. One of the stats give the user base of the site. </p>

<p>Every site needs a solid group of core users to assist in moderating the site. We recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>150 users with 200+ rep </li>
<li>10 users with 2,000+ rep </li>
<li>5 users with 3,000+ rep </li>
</ul>

<p>We can think of the need of 2k+ users. When the site graduates at that moment, they have edit privileges and review suggested edits and assist moderators according to the rep boundaries of a graduated site. Similarly, 3k+ users have access to all the review queues and participate in review queues. At 3k, they get to cast a close/reopen vote. So, those 5 users can close and reopen without a moderator intervention. </p>

<p>What is the role of 200+ users (avid) in assisting moderation? There is new privilege at 200. All they can do is vote and flag which are earned at 15. Besides these, they can suggest edits for which they can do it from day 1.</p>

<ul>
<li>We only allow evidence-based answers</li>
<li>We allow very controversial questions on inflammatory topics (e.g. school shootings)</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that  people avoid the ""evidence"" rule by abusing comments to write ""pseudo-answers""--usually, in fact, their personal opinions, without any evidence to back that up. Of course this often leads to flame wars, with people literally insulting each other, and often even purging all the comments does not prevent the flame from restarting soon later.</p>

<p>So we do moderate the comments by asking people to calm down. We do moderate the comment threads by nuking them all when things are out of control. Yet, in some <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40718/are-violent-video-games-a-better-explanation-of-school-shootings-than-access-to"">cases</a> we have to go through 2-3-4 cycles of ""purge all comments"".</p>

We can certainly do <em>without this feature</em>, but this would be a real time saver.

"307348","Stop automatically merging accounts without asking the users","<p>Currently, users are automatically merged if SE detects certain situations that indicate that the users belong to the same real person. Some aspects of this have been mentioned in meta posts, but in general this isn't a well documented system, and some aspects are likely not publicly known at all.</p>

<p>Using several accounts is not officially supported, but so far it is generally tolerated as long as the accounts never interact at all. Probably the most common legitimate reason to use several accounts is privacy, to avoid linking certain posts to an account that uses a real name or is otherwise not anonymous.</p>

<p>If someone asked me how to ask a question anonymously when they already have an SE account, my answer would probably make me look rather paranoid. When I do this, I use the TOR browser to create a browser sessions that has no chance of being connected to my real account in any way, and I abandon the account after I'm done and don't reuse it. I don't know how the automatic account merges work, so this is the only way I know that should avoid them in any case. This is obviously not a very reasonable answer to an average person asking how to ask an anonymous question on SE, but it's the only safe one right now.</p>

<p>I know this isn't an officially supported way to use SE, but I'm not asking to officially support it. I'm only asking to change the automatic merges so that they don't happen without the user confirming them, so that they'll never break the privacy of a person using SE accounts in this way. </p>

<p>The SE network has expanded to a lot of different topics, and unless you're a completely anonymous user, there are quite a few sites where it can easily be problematic to participate. Asking a question on Workplace under your real name would often be a dangerous thing to do, linking your religious or political views to your real name is also something many people would hesitate to do for understandable reasons. But all these things are encouraged by the way the SE account system currently works.</p>

<p>Changing the automatic merges would make it significantly safer to use a second anonymous account, and I do think this is a use case that should be tolerated, even if it isn't officially supported.</p>

<p>PS: This has nothing to do with vote fraud, or any other use of socks that is against the SE rules. Those are never merged anyway, they're deleted outright.</p>

<p>When I work on a post for an extended period of time it stops saving drafts. When that happens it is impossible to get it to save again, no matter what I do. I have tried</p>

<ul>
<li>Typing some more</li>
<li>Waiting some more</li>
<li>Trying to navigate away from the page but clicking ‘cancel’ on the popup</li>
<li>Actually navigating away from the page</li>
<li>Begging it to save</li>
<li>Standing on my head</li>
<li>Pulling faces (No, I didn't resort to this really)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Unfortunately I can't tell you exactly when it stops saving, but I can give you a real example of what I did when this occurred:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I started writing this question and continued typing for a few minutes; it saved drafts just as it was supposed to. I left it to stand for a while (perhaps ten minutes) after it had already saved a draft. I came back and started typing constantly again, watching to see it if it would stop saving. It saved about three times, then failed altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is especially annoying to me because I always work on a new post for a long time, meaning that I have this problem 100% of the time. To make it worse, the mains electricity at my home often trips the earth leakage (it’s the incoming power -- nothing I can do about it). The result is that I have often lost large portions of posts I am working on. I know I can write posts in a text editor, but I would rather write it in the question or answer box for three reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>When working with a few images it if often important to be able to see the post as it will look</li>
<li>I can see what it looks like while writing</li>
<li>I like to keep an eye on new questions and the review queue at the same time</li>
</ul>

"307605","Sorting SEDE output is unstable","<p>When you sort the output of a Stack Exchange Data Explorer query by a column that contains duplicate values, any rows sharing the same value in the column will end up ordered semi-randomly relative to each other.  Repeatedly sorting the data by the same column will cause the relative order of the rows to change.  <a href=""https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/814724/sort-stability-test"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's a quick test to demonstrate this:</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0cvjm.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0cvjm.gif"" alt=""Animated screenshot of unstable data sorting""></a></p>

<p>Note how the numbers are initially sorted in ascending numerical order, but sorting them by their parity (""even"" or ""odd"") jumbles the relative order of the numbers having the same parity.</p>

<p><strong>It would be much more useful if the sorting operation was <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517793/what-is-stability-in-sorting-algorithms-and-why-is-it-important"">stable</a>, so that sorting data by a column would not change the relative order of rows that have the same value in that column.</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that <a href=""https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.DataExplorer/blob/afaa5d627b100f1aaec6186a29b2c6f4053111b8/App/StackExchange.DataExplorer/Scripts/query.resultset.js#L43"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the client-side sorting implementation</a> used by SEDE is based on SlickGrid, which simply uses <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaScript's array sort() method</a>, which is not guaranteed to be stable.  (Note that some browsers <em>may</em> use a stable sorting algorithm, so this behavior can be browser dependent.  I used Chromium 64 for the test above.  See also <a href=""https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/issues/320"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SlickGrid issue #320</a>.)</p>

<p>To fix this, either the sorting code should be rewritten to use a naturally stable sorting algorithm (such as merge sort), or the sort should be stabilized by making the comparison function break ties based on the current order of the rows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Raise the bar to two flags instead of one</li>

<p>It covers the concern that a user might not understand why their grace period expired (your spam/rude answer is collecting multiple downvotes), and ensures that a single user can't end it by themselves.

"307751","Is ""Ask Question"" a better search tool than the search bar in Stack Overflow","<p>I've been observing that asking a question is a way better search tool than the search bar. Here is an example:</p>

<p>Say, this is what I am looking for: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pandas number of subgroups for each group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's see which one of the following three methods will return better search results.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search"">SO search bar</a>, and type it in there. It returns only one result, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42195515/pandas-groupby-operation-with-missing-data"">that result</a> is really not an answer to what we are looking for.</li>
<li>Try <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask"">""Ask Question""</a>, and type it in there, and you'll see that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41665965/pandas-number-of-subgroups-per-index"">the first result that comes out</a> is perfectly what that search query would be looking for!</li>
<li>Go to <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google</a>, and search like this: <code>site:stackoverflow.com pandas number of subgroups for each group</code>, and the first result is again that useful post.</li>

<p>At the moment I'm relying on a shasum of the object (seen as <code>id</code>) but if <code>detail</code> doesn't change then that won't work any more. </p>

<p>The second problem stems from the order of the timeline and paging. If new activity is added to the timeline, the entry is added to the beginning of <code>items</code> and the items on the page boundaries are shifted. If this happens during querying, I can't easily identify if the shifted entry is in fact a duplicate that has shifted from the previous page, or just an entry that has similar data. </p>

<p>If the results could be sorted the opposite way (by time, from oldest to newest) then paging wouldn't be an issue as items wouldn't be able to shift pages, new activity would be appended to the end and pages remain consistent. </p>

<p>A unique ID would also suffice but I'm assuming this is some kind of view into data so there no id to attach.</p>

"307953","Banned from asking questions due to connecting a Google account that associated questions with my current account?","<p>A few years ago I was a total programming noob and signed up to StackOverflow in order to get help (more like leeching) with programming issues I was having. My account was quickly blocked from asking questions and I learnt my lesson.</p>

<p>Fast forward today and I have a new account I had made early 2017. The account has no down-voted questions (it has up-voted ones), it has 317 rep and I have answered a few questions that have been accepted as solving people's issues etc. My account is definitely not on the grounds for a question ban.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the other day I accidentally clicked 'Log in with Google' which was still associated with my old account, it somehow merged my old Profile with my current one, with that came the old picture and more importantly the old questions, plus the question ban..</p>

<p>The old questions are poor quality and are the reason for this ban? But how can I disassociate them with my new and healthy account? The questions are from 2015 for example, I made this account in 2017.</p>

<p>I'm quite worried as apparently nobody can fix this for you but this seems more of a login/merge mistake than any fault of mine.</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like that old Google account deleted too.</p>

"307991","Including number (#) symbol on a quote","<p>I am having trouble when trying to display the <code>#</code> symbol on the start of a quote<sup>1</sup>, as if I do it appears as a header instead, like:</p>

"308042","Could moderators have some long-term activity data between ""quarter"" and ""all time""?","<p>The moderator dashboard includes useful tallies of things like flags handled, comments deleted, questions mod-closed, and so on.  We can view this information for the current day, week, month, quarter... or all time.  Missing from this list is year.</p>

<p>Several times now I have found myself wanting to answer questions like ""are we getting more flags than we used to or does it just feel that way?"".  We can <em>sort of</em> assess this for the recent past by comparing month to quarter, but fluctuations like holidays or current events can throw that off.  On the other hand, ""all time"" doesn't provide the right perspective on sites that are several years old.  Being able to see trends over six months or a year would be more helpful.</p>

<p>Why do I want to answer questions like these?  Because sometimes it feels like the mod team is doing more work, but maybe the <em>work</em> hasn't changed but <em>we're</em> doing something wrong or need a vacation or something.  When perceptions of increased workload lead to the beginnings of conversations about whether we should ask SE for another moderator, I'd like to be able to sanity-check perceptions against data.  If our perceptions are off, that's a different problem that we might need to attack in a different way.</p>

<p>Adding a ""year"" tab to the existing dashboard is one approach.  (That <em>seems</em> not too hard.)  Adding moderation stats to the mod analytics, so we could see (aggregate, not per-mod) graphs of these events over time like we can for posts, visits, votes, etc, would let us see trends over time including cyclical changes, but might be more work.  Maybe there are other ways to share the information with mods too; I'm requesting functionality, not a specific interface.  It's just that ""ping Shog in TL and ask"" doesn't scale.</p>

<p><a href=""https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/domains/16302"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/domains/16302</a></p>

<p>Currently, it shows 78 spam samples, the majority of which have arrived in the last two weeks, at an accelerating rate. The oldest are four months old.</p>

<p>The spam messages are vaguely promoting technical support services, often with what appears to be thinly disguised ""answers"" to questions which are by and large unrelated (for instance, just now, <a href=""https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/post/110992"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's one about Raspberry Pi on an Ubuntu site which gets a ""reply"" promoting Microsoft Edge support services.)</a></p>

<p>Baba is not alone; in metasmoke, we have 18 domains currently tagged with <a href=""https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/domains/tags/13"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#fake-tech-support</a> but the other 17 together have spammed less than this one operation. (Tagging is a relatively new feature and not many of our volunteers are actively updating tags, so this is necessarily an incomplete view.)</p>

<p>As a Stack Exchange user and Charcoal volunteer, I think this needs to be escalated to the service providers whose networks are being used to perpetrate this; very often, the spammers are violating the terms of service of their providers by using spam to drive traffic to their site.</p>

<p>The domain is hosted on 107.155.66.50 which appears to belong to Incero.com so that's where I am planning to complain. I have previously sent a complaint to GoDaddy / Domaincontrol as the DNS hosting appears to be theirs.</p>

"308227","I'm changing the ""not generally applicable"" close reason here on Meta SE","<p>This is a small administrative note.</p>

<p>For the past 3 years and 11 months, we've had an off-topic reason defined here for use on questions that are only relevant to a specific site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question <strong>pertains only to a specific site</strong> in the Stack Exchange Network. Questions on Meta Stack Exchange should pertain to our network or software that drives it as a whole, within the guidelines defined in <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">the help center</a>. You should ask this question on the meta site where your concern originated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this isn't even close to the most common close reason here; that'd be duplicate. Nor is it anywhere close to the most commonly-used off-topic reason; that'd be ""This question does not appear to be about the software that powers the Stack Exchange network"" A.K.A. ""you asked a programming question here"". </p>

<p>But it has still been used 95 times in the past 90 days, which is surprising for a reason that mostly exists because we needed to retrain folks who were used to coming here for questions specific to Stack Overflow. So I decided to take a look at how it's been used. Here's a random sample from the past 30 days:</p>

<ol>

<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307172/getting-a-weird-screen-when-refreshing-pages-on-stack-overflow"">Not seeing any questions when ignoring the tags all questions are in</a> - yes, this does have ""Stack Overflow"" in the title, but the behavior is common to every site. <strong>NOT OT</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>So... That's 40% inaccurate. Not... great.</p>

<p>This is potentially a bigger problem than it sounds though: for most users, this is the <em>only</em> meta site they can post on. The rep requirement for asking a question here is 1; on Stack Overflow (and most other sites), it's 5. There's a loophole there if they happen to be asking about their own question, but if they're asking about tag filtering or suggesting edits... No dice. So this is a really critical bit of the support puzzle, even if it's not used that heavily: if you want to <em>guarantee</em> that someone can ask their question, you send 'em here.  </p>

<p>After mulling on this for a bit, I've realized that perhaps the close reason itself is to blame; the emphasis starts on ""pertains"" when it should be on ""only"". There's some ambiguity in the rest of it as well; is MathJax part of the software that drives the network <em>as a whole</em>? The help center page doesn't really clarify that either.</p>

<p>So I'm switching it up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question's topic is <strong>only</strong> applicable to <em>one specific site</em> in the Stack Exchange Network. Questions on Meta Stack Exchange should relate to features or policies that commonly apply to the network or the software that drives it, within the guidelines defined in <a href=""/help/on-topic"">the help center</a>. You should ask this question on the meta site where your concern originated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Focus on the <strong>topic</strong> of the question. This is an off-<strong>topic</strong> reason, after all.</li>
<li>Explicit requirement that the topic be applicable to <em>one specific site</em> vs. the implication that anything that doesn't apply to <em>every</em> site is off-topic. </li>
</ol>

<p>Please let me know if you see anything confusing or concerning in the new wording. I'll be monitoring its use as well.</p>

<p>Also... Please remember that there are now <em>over eight years worth of questions</em> on Meta Stack Exchange, and plenty of folks with gold-badge close abilities: many new questions can be closed as duplicates with little effort, thus saving time and frustration for both the asker and the close voters. Off-topic should be reserved for stuff that simply <em>cannot</em> be answered here, not stuff that perhaps <em>could</em> be answered elsewhere. </p>

In this case the only answer added was my own. Even when I temporarily deleted the answer, I still got this warning when I tried to delete the question. So is this a bug? It seems to me the reason for penalising a person for deleting a question with an answer is that the answer took up the time of another user, and so you've wasted their time. If the answer is your own, then that rationale wouldn't apply.

<p>In the other hand, in Earths Sciences, the SE community I'm more active in. New fields of research don't appear very often, the thought process to come up with a question is much longer and questions don't tend to be that specific, so you are more likely to find the answer already somewhere on the internet.</p>

<p>As a consequence, Earths Sciences beta duplicates or triplicates graduation requirements when it comes to avid users or visits, but it does very bad when it comes to the average number of questions per day.</p>

<p>Given all the above: <strong>Does it really makes sense to have fix minimum requirements for all beta sites?</strong></p>

<p>Also, similar differences can explain why some sites will have more answers per questions than others.</p>

<p>Officially the API is unchanged since version 2.2 in February of 2014.
But we know from <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bug+api+status-completed"">the resolved bugs here</a>, and on Stack Apps, that this isn't true.  And the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/308260/148310"">developers admit as much</a> with statements like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of the last build, (your problem has been fixed)...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <strong>how do we get the build/compile/deploy date and the <em>real</em> version number</strong> (EG: 2.2.6, or similar)?</p>

<p>I can find nothing in the API, nor the API docs that provides anything like this.  As previously mentioned, the change log does not.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Requested interface:</h3>

<p>Ideally, this would be provided as a new route, perhaps <code>/status</code>, that returns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build/Compile/Deploy date in Unix epoch time (same as other API datetimes).</li>
<li>Precise/exact version number that increments with every single change.</li>
<li>Last outage time, or last start time, or runtime since last (re)start.</li>

<ol>
<li>Search for a duplicate question and flag it as such.</li>
<li>Mark it as ""No Action Needed"" if it is a good question, despite there possibly being a duplicate somewhere on the site.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is it my duty as a first posts reviewer to check for duplicates, or is this supposed to be left for triage questions? If I check for duplicates for every single first post that I review, the review time will increase significantly. If everyone does this, it will take a lot longer for posts to be reviewed.</p>

<p>Often on the sites I visit regularly (Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange), I see moderators closing obvious off-topic questions, but not deleting them. There is no way to salvage those posts, the only thing that can happen is that the author gets into an argument with other members about the closing.</p>

<p>So that made me wonder: why do moderators not hit the delete button right after they have closed such questions? Is it common practice or policy not to do so? What are the reasons behind it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>We don't want the information on our site to become obsolete, and so we try not to ask questions whose answers may change with time. This means we don't re-ask the same question once it's been answered, we keep adding to the previous question.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't site-specific policy &mdash; this bullet point was added in 2013 by a CM <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/182812/introducing-a-brand-new-consolidated-help-center"">along with the launch of the help center</a>. This launch was also contemporaneous with <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons"">the removal of the Too Localized close reason</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes RPG Stack Exchange gets questions about the state of release of specific content or products: whether they're still in testing, whether they're out, when the release date is if it's known, etc. Recently one of these questions was closed by my fellow moderator with the following reason:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm closing this question because “is it out yet?” questions have a limited life: they either get obsolete answers (before it's out) or become obsolete themselves (after it's out). RPG.SE is for “forever” questions, not current events. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I asked them about this, they pointed back to that above Help Center bullet point. We don't agree it means we should close this kind of question though. Their stance is as stated there. Mine is that we can't be for just “forever” questions: questions can naturally have their answers change over time as new content gets released, and it's fine to handle release date questions and answer them then let them become obsolete.</p>

<p>Our users have already started exploring site-specific policy, but we're both interested in finding out what the state of network-wide policy is:</p>

<p><strong>Is that bullet point quoted at the top still a relevant network policy? Is it outdated? Was/is it meant to imply we only ask “forever” questions, and avoid questions which may inevitably become irrelevant/obsolete, such as asking about state of release and release dates?</strong></p>

<p>While these points pertain mostly to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>, it makes sense to post here, as the help centre forms the template for the help centres across the network. Besides going to the source of the problem - Stack Overflow meta is not going to help solve this. We need some sanity from the rest of the network to help resolve this. Besides Stack Overflow is the flagship of our network and how it functions affects the network.</p>

It's about people trying to contribute to our community, new or old, and addressing the less favourable aspects of a group that can develop online or anywhere.  </p>

<p>In the help section under <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/behavior"">What kind of behavior is expected of users?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It is at this point I'd recommend adding in a blurb about piling on comments. When several users comment under a post, essentially saying the same thing, it can become overwhelming for the poster. It frequently results in the poster becoming defensive and, often rude, as from the poster's point of view it can feel like they're being bullied. We need to put ourselves into the shoes of someone coming onto the site and trying to make a decent question. </p>

<p>Understanding how the community works is not intuitive for everyone and the help section - is long and let's face it - we can pick and choose parts of the help section at times and use it as a weapon to bang over people's heads if we're not careful.</p>

<p>When a person comments on a post, is it necessary for others to flood in with similar comments or support of the initial commenter? Are we truly trying to achieve an optimum outcome for that post and poster or are we actually behaving as a group defending our territory? What can we do to improve this?</p>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub>Find an example of such an edit <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/posts/49855634/revisions"">here</a> (edit #2).</sub></p>

<p>I have mainly found two areas where this is used:</p>

<ol>
<li>To provide a better answer/question, basically rendering the ""old"" part obsolete</li>
<li>To add information </li>
</ol>

<p>Highlighting which part of the post was added in an edit seems to serve one purpose, which is to help people who have already read the post quickly find what has changed.</p>

<p>But isn't the idea of Stack Exchange posts that they answer questions for everyone who might find them in the future? Why should they care about which part has been added as an edit? Shouldn't we strive to change our post to incorporate the new information in a natural way and deleting obsolete parts of the post?</p>

<p>I found myself removing these blocks often with edits since I don't see a reason how they could be useful. But they are so frequent that I started questioning myself as to whether I am right by doing so. </p>

<p>So my question is: Is there ever a situation in which it is <strong>better</strong> (not just OK) to simply append new information in an ""<strong>Edit</strong>"" block?</p>

"309117","Auto-deleted posts from spammers and trolls should get the ""this is spam/rude"" warning","<p>When a <strong>post</strong> is deleted by spam or rude/abusive flags, users who can see deleted posts see a warning along the lines of ""this post was deleted as spam or offensive"".  If they want to see the actual post, they have to click through.  Many 10k users on my sites appreciate this shielding.</p>

<p>When a <strong>user</strong> is destroyed with the ""created to post spam or nonsense"" reason, all posts from that user are automatically deleted.  This gives moderators a quick way to purge all the bad content.  (Sometimes these users manage to post several times before being caught.)</p>

<p>However, these auto-deleted posts don't get the special shielding, even though the user was deleted for spamming.  Maybe that's because we don't want to shield the pure-garbage posts we sometimes see; those aren't offensive, just garbage.  We don't have a destruction reason for ""offensive"", and spam and offensive are often treated the same way, so this is the reason that moderators use.</p>

<p>One of my sites has been getting a lot of <em>very</em> offensive troll posts recently.  The posts get deleted quickly, but I'd like our 10k users to not have to see them either.  It seems logical to me that if a user was destroyed for being a spammer or troll, then when we auto-delete the posts we should treat them as if they had been individually flagged.</p>

<p>Can we treat posts that were deleted for being rude or spam the same way regardless of how they got deleted?</p>

"309317","Block “{{tag}} question” and similar as a question title","<h3>Proposal</h3>

<p>At least once a day, I see a question titled with something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dynamical systems question<br>
  Photoshop issue<br>
  publication problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where the first part of the title is also a tag of the question. These question titles do not provide any information that cannot be found in the tags and thus are maximally useless. From another point of view, such a title would be equally (badly) fitting to every single question in said tag.
I propose that such titles are blocked automatically, i.e., the asker cannot post the question and is shown a notice urging them to choose a better title.</p>

<h3>Specific criterion</h3>

<p>Barring punctuation and grammatical number, the title is one of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[tag] [buzzword]<br>
  [buzzword] [preposition] [tag]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>tag</em> is a tag applied to the question or a synonym thereof </li>
<li><em>buzzword</em> is <em>question, issue, problem, …</em></li>
<li><em>preposition</em> is <em>about, on, with …</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>A much stricter version of this filter (banning <em>question</em> and <em>problem</em> from titles altogether) exists on Stack Overflow, Super User and Server Fault.
This is not what I propose here.
In contrast to these filters, I cannot imagine a false positive for this filter, i.e., a good title that would be blocked.</p></li>
<li><p>I am aware that some stubborn idiot will find a way around this filter – they are not my target group.

Robert describes how the goal is to bring an existing and active community to Area 51 and start building their new Stack Exchange site, not to start the community building process at Area 51.
I left a comment there, but I think the matter is worth more elaboration.</p>

<p><strong>If I can't start building the community at Area 51, where and how could I create a community that I could bring there?</strong>
There typically is no pre-existing community.
And even if there was, it's hard to start building a Q&amp;A community if we first have to get somehow magically organized before we can come to Area 51 and even propose having a Q&amp;A site.
If nothing else, it would be useful to have some hints or suggestions to start building a community &mdash; and know whether the SE network wants to be a part of that early stage.</p>

<p>For example, I am a Finn and I would much like to see a site for <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/116429/finnish-language?referrer=CoJV4YboC6vc9VHJukmKQg2"">Finnish language (currently in definition at Area 51)</a>.
I am not interested in starting just any online community concerning the Finnish language, but a Q&amp;A site at SE.
It's hard to find followers if I can't show them something they can act on.</p>

<p>As I understand from the announcement, this aspect of community building is outside the scope of Area 51.
Therefore I brought this up here on the general meta.
My point is not to rant but to make clear what I do not understand about the new site building process; I genuinely don't know how the system is supposed to work at the very beginning.</p>

<p>The problems with those previous ideas (according to discussion on the posts themselves, official responses, and/or my personal opinion, depending on the case) largely boiled down to two things: the new idea would increase complexity and the team is understandably reluctant to change a behavior that is extremely familiar/ingrained to even casual users. My proposal should be easier on both fronts.</p>

<p>Instead of changing the ordering algorithm, what about leaving accepted answers ""pinned to top"" and just providing an indication that an accepted answer is not the highest-score answer, where applicable?</p>

<p>For cases where an accepted answer is outscored, we could show, say, a yellow checkmark instead of the standard green, or a checkmark with an asterisk overlay, or something. I know that needs polishing (not great for the color-blind or on meta) but it makes the point for now.</p>

<p>This does introduce <em>some</em> new complexity, in that question pages would have to check relative scores, but it's not as bad as coming up with a new algorithm for score display. The bigger win is with user expectations. People will still see the post they expect, where they expect it, and the location of the icon they're already familiar with (and likely already using, too; subconsciously if not consciously) would provide a hint that a better answer might exist and it might be worth the user's time to scroll down.</p>

<p>It's been noted that accepted answers are their questions' highest-scoring answers in the vast majority of cases. In those cases, my proposal would change nothing.</p>

<p>I would suggest to the folks at StackExchange corporate, that if you're truly of good intent here, that you get your legal folks to either remove the confidentiality entirely, or significantly amend it to protect our rights to disclose any injury or tort publicly.  If you're just avoiding spurious litigation, this shouldn't have any impact on you - your arbitration record will be clean. But if StackExchange does do something bad in the future, such as misuse our private data, it's imperative that we have the right to communicate that injury to the world at large so we can protect ourselves.</p>

"310426","Is it wrong to edit your own old answer to reflect changes in the technology when another user's answer already does this?","<p>So I have a slight ethical issue.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I answered <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28659845/swift-how-to-get-the-indexpath-row-when-a-button-in-a-cell-is-tapped/29792963#29792963"">this</a> question with what I believed at the time to be a good answer. I had just started out in my field (iOS Development) at the time and was chuffed that I was able to assist another developer so early into my own career.</p>

<p>As my career progressed and my knowledge grew, I became more aware of the pitfalls of using an approach such as the one I suggested in my answer. This was also pointed out by a couple of other users who suggested better approaches in alternative answers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people who visit an SO question usually grab the answer with the most upvotes (generally new users/programmers), which is mine, given that it's been there the longest, meaning that they are potentially setting themselves up for said pitfalls they could avoid by simply taking another answer.</p>

<p>This seemed like madness to me, so I edited my <strong>original</strong> answer to explain the pitfalls of the approach and suggest my new favourite alternative approach. I made sure to suggest that the reader scrolls down in the thread and browse the host of suggestions from different users, as most of them are valid.</p>

<p>Now it should be noted that this isn't about reputation at this stage; it's a case of 'my answer is what 80% of people will take and I want their code to be solid'. That said, others in the thread suggested <strong>the same thing I edited into my answer, first</strong>. Does that mean I'm capitalising on their efforts unfairly?</p>

<p>This is where my problem lies. I'm torn between the dilemma of potentially absolving others of well deserved reputation, and knowingly allowing users to use potentially unpredictable code. I considered straight up deleting my answer, but I think it serves as a valuable lesson, particularly for new developers, as to why approaches such as that are not best.</p>

<p>Would love to hear the community's thoughts on this one.</p>

<p>Seems like a good idea - aim to ask a question that others might have as well, help more people.</p>

<p>But sometimes, I have no choice but to ask a very specific question, because my problem is so specific, I can't find the answer anywhere.</p>

<p><em>You can skip to the last paragraph to get to my question</em></p>

<p>I recently had a post of mine downvoted. Actually, most of my posts have gotten a downvote.</p>

<p>I'm assuming it's not because I didn't do my due diligence, because I always spend a lot of time making sure the answer isn't out there before I ask (And I very rarely miss something, because just as I wouldn't want my time wasted, I don't want to waste others' time).</p>

<p>I'm also assuming it's not because what I write is unclear. Most of the purposed edits make slight corrections - an occasional spelling mistake, or phrasing - English is not my native language...</p>

<p>I also try to be as detailed as possible, so whomever is kind enough to attempt to help me won't have to waste his time interrogating me. It's hard to balance giving all the details with not writing too much.</p>

<p>Basically, I assume that the main reason for my posts being downvoted is because they aren't of interest (and of course I might be wrong, but I think thi is still a valid question)</p>

<p>So, is lack of interest in a question a valid reason to downvote it? I've always percieved the stackexchange sites as a platform to ask for help, but downvoting a question on the grounds that it isn't interesting makes things... different.</p>

In that thread they say it's fine to use a mod attention flag if you want to clarify the reason you're flagging; for example, you might be flagging ""not an answer"", but want to explain why the answer isn't an answer. This use is also covered in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/310638/145982"">Should a custom flag be used instead of the &quot;not an answer&quot; flag when the answer isn&#39;t a blatant non-answer?</a>.</p>

<p>However, whether or not a post is obviously not an answer is subjective, and you can end up in the weird case where you think a post isn't an answer, you use a mod flag to explain why, and it gets rejected because the post was <em>too obviously</em> not an answer to warrant that flag -- you should have used the standard flag instead.</p>

"310822","Is embedding arbitrary external images GDPR compliant?","<p>Currently, SE allows user to embed arbitrary images (from HTTPS sources) into posts and into comments in chat. The consequence of this is that whoever controls the server those images are hosted on can track visits to the page the image is embedded. </p>

<p>While the IP address and browser user agent alone might not be personal information, especially in chat it is likely that someone could connect those to SE users. </p>

<p>According to the privacy policy, when SE intentionally shares data with external providers, they require those to sign an agreement on how to handle that data. There is no such agreement with random image hosts that any user could embed in posts.</p>

<p>This is not a new concern, there have been several meta posts about this issue before:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/55665/151385"">Allowing images from external sources opens doors to serious security exploits</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/231613/151385"">Disallow new embedded images from hosts other than the SE imgur account</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also more than just these privacy issues with allowing image embedding from other sources like those images becoming unavailable after a while.</p>

<p>SE has a useable internal image hosting feature for many years now, there is no need to still allow users to embed images from other sources, given the potential issues with this.</p>

<p>Handling the existing embedded images is a bit more tricky. Converting them into plain links without embedding the images is probably the easiest way to handle this without too much effort.</p>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, I don't have the necessary knowledge to decide whether this is an issue according to the GDPR. But with the recent focus on data collection and handling I think it makes sense to revisit it, and maybe just to fix this even if does not violate the letter of the law after all.</p>

<p>and links to the ""original"" question. I find this, at least, misleading, considering we (at least in RPG.se) close questions as duplicates if <strong>the questions</strong> are duplicates, not if ""This question already has an answer somewhere else"". </p>

<p>For me, the current wording implies that</p>

<ul>
<li>If a question was already made and has no answers, it's fine to ask it again, instead of giving a bounty.</li>
<li>If Question (1) has a broader/more general <strong>answer</strong> than what was asked, Question (2) ""already has an answer in Question (1)"", even if the question themselves are different.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second case seems frequent enough in RPG.se, where I'm a frequent user, specially from new users. I, myself, flagged wrongly two or three questions because a good answer for another question already answered that, before understanding better the actual concept of duplicate questions.</p>

<p>Should we (and, maybe more importantly, can we?) change it to something more accurate with our policies? My first thoughts were</p>

<p>Markdown:</p>

<p><code>[Here is the original link text](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=extruder&amp;sort=votes)</code></p>

Instead, in this case, I wish to get the permanent URL of exactly which comments I had flagged. You can find your old, declined comment flags on <code>https://SITE.stackexchange.com/users/flag-summary/USERID?group=4&amp;status=3</code>.</p>

<p>The previous request apparently got resolved by this answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't. Comments are ephemeral. Once they've been deleted, only moderators can view them, and not even simply at that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, <strong>I am just asking for the permanent URL of the comment, not for the text of the comment</strong>. If I am browsing through my flagging history - say a month later - I would want to be able to know which comments I had flagged that got declined. If a month later, that comment exists, great! If not, I would sadly move on.</p>

<p>I know that currently the way to do so is to click on the grey flag icon - <em>one by one for every comment below that post</em> - and it would show ""You have already raised this type of flag"" for the comment I had flagged. It works, but it isn't really ideal.</p>

<li>Somehow indicate when javascript has loaded, perhaps by fading them in or out a little, or perhaps the ""you have upvotes"" button could be animated (that wouldn't help me in the chat case, but it would work for some cases).</li>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2678"">Database schema documentation for the public data dump and SEDE</a></p>

<p>It was seriously overhauled in revisions <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/2678/75"">75</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/2678/76"">76</a> but I had to do a partial patch in revision <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/2678/77"">77</a> because in the process we lost the PostHistory table and the editor didn't respond to our <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede/2678#comment1011513_2678"">calls</a>.</p>

<p>The content of that answer need to be generated based on instructions offered as editor notes, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used this XLSM Template to help generate the markdown including ToolTips:
    <a href=""http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=36027958558653296420"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=36027958558653296420</a>
    Make changes mostly on tab 'SEDE All Tables`, then copy cell [Q1] to Notepad to replace """" with "" , then paste in here.  Please help improve it!  Update the link above with most recent version (maybe save old links too?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is where the first problem starts, that XSLM file is no longer available. Editing that answer has now become a headache, as you need to rely on external offsite resources and tooling not everyone is accustomed with.</p>

<p>I admit that post struggled with layout before the recent revisions but I'm not sure if these latest changes are an improvement. Personally I find it cumbersome I have to hover over the PostTypeId fields and VoteTypeId fields to see which values are available:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/M5qWI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/M5qWI.png"" alt=""hover""></a></p>

<p>but maybe others like the tidiness of this view and the higher information density.</p>

<p>I realize there are only a few users editing and maintaining that answer but it gets referenced a lot (194 times on MSE but I'm sure there will be incoming links from around the network) so I rather keep the usefulness and correctness of that answer up to par.</p>

<p>Before I destroy value only because I dislike the editing process that is now forced on me and the layout it offers, can you share how you would like to see we go forward with that post? Answers can maybe elaborate how we can keep the high information density while only relying on tooling available to all of us.</p>

<p>I'll interpret down votes on this question as <em>No, don't rollback, it is fine, you deal with it</em> in case you don't want to write an answer or leave a comment. (up votes don't mean <em>go ahead</em>, write an answer or leave a comment instead).</p>

"312127","Code of Conduct: enforcement and sanctioning","<p>The <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/312038/164572"">new Code of Conduct</a> outlines and clarifies a number of our rules. But it also includes a section on how violators of those rules will be punished. I don't want to discuss particulars of the CoC itself. I want to investigate the structure of sanctioning for such rules.</p>

<p>These rules apply to everyone. That's their purpose; to outline how we should and should not interact with other people. No one should be exempt or immune, and all should be bound by these rules equally.</p>

<p>But sanctions for rule violations <em>inherently</em> matter to established users more than newer ones.</p>

<p>There are several reasons for this. Newer users are less engaged on the site than frequent users. As such, they will simply have fewer chances to break the rules. A one-and-done account may only make 5 comments, and even then only on their single question. A sub-50 rep account is limited solely to comments on their questions.</p>

<p>By contrast, established users see many questions. They seek them out. They comment on them, as a part of trying to keep the site clean, to rescue bad questions from the scrap heap. Per unit time on the site, an established user will make more comments, and therefore have more chances to fall afoul of the rules.</p>

<p>Additionally, regulars and veterans spend a significant amount of time on the site. So not only will they have more comments per-unit-time than a newer user, they will have a longer time to make those comments.</p>

<p>Coupled with that is the fact that regulars and veterans are tasked with keeping the sites clean and functional. Whether through review queues or just from reading the site, these diligent people will see the absolute worst the site has to offer. While this is no excuse for being rude, it's hardly surprising that, after dupe-closing the same question for the tenth time, one's patience has worn rather thin.</p>

<p>But the big reason why rule violations matter more to established users than newer ones is because the accounts of regular users matter more to them than the accounts of new users matter to those users. If a new user gets banned for saying <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/366733/734069"">any of these things</a>, meh, no big deal. Even if they don't just create a new account (which may or may not go undiscovered), not being on SO does not matter to them. They don't care about the ban status of their account that much. They may complain about it on Twitter or some random blog post, but their interaction with their SO account is over.</p>

<p>By contrast, regular users are heavily invested in their accounts. We attach reputation and so forth to it. We associate your questions and answers to it. To abandon your own account would be painful for a lot of users.</p>

<p>The ability to comment or post is really important to such people. Take that away, even temporarily, and you impact them far more than you impact newer users. Give a new user a 3-day ban, and they probably won't come back. Give an established user a 3-day ban, and odds are good they probably will.</p>

<p>Not only that, there's the whack-a-mole factor. Every day, hundreds of new users show up. A non-trivial number of them will have a bad attitude and quickly run afoul of our CoC. And they will be sanctioned. But how you sanction them is irrelevant, since most of them won't be coming back. Even if you perma-ban them for a single infraction, just as many such users will show up tomorrow. And the next day. No matter what sanctions you impose on an individual bad-acting new user, there will be another to replace him tomorrow.</p>

<p>So the number of <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/366733/734069"">rude comments from new users</a> will not be significantly addressed by sanctioning them.</p>

<p>By contrast, regular users of SO are a finite resource. Ban one, and there won't be a replacement. Or at least, not for quite some time; it takes a while to create a quality user of the site.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not saying that established users should be exempt from the CoC, or that they should be given leniency. What I'm saying is that whatever sanctioning procedures exist need to take the above factors into account. Not merely that the punishment fit the crime, but that there should be some recognition for how many good interactions such a user had before their bad one. New users have few interactions either way. Established users have many.</p>

<p>That is, a blanket policy of instituting a ban for making X number of CoC-violating comments would not be reasonable. Such a policy doesn't take into account the difference between a user with only 10 comments and a user with 1000.</p>

<p>The concern I have is that a sanctioning policy will be either mechanical (X number of infractions = Y punishment) or too subjective (always chosen by community moderators, who naturally have their own biases and blind spots). The mechanical one will catch far more of our established users while doing little to nothing about bad behavior from new ones. And while bringing CMs in on the process can certainly ensure that punishments fit the crime, that opens up an entirely new issue: how much you trust your CMs.</p>

<p>It's important that the CoC is genuinely enforced. That ""slipping up"" is not OK and won't just be brushed aside (thus dealing with people who ""slip up"" much more than acceptable). But it's just as important to realize that ""slipping up"" is a lot easier when you make 3,000 comments every year or so than when you only make 3.</p>

<p>How exactly do we create that balance going forward?</p>

The reason provided was that abuse becomes more difficult to handle when no rate limit exists.</p>

<p>I think there's a pretty simple solution to this question: if and <em>only</em> if you're flagging multiple comments on the same post, do not rate-limit the flagger. This means someone who wants to go through and flag 5/20 comments in one conversation on a post doesn't have to wait 30 seconds to do it. But the next time someone tries to flag comments on a <em>different</em> post, the 5-second rate limit applies. </p>

<p>The most common use case for comment flags that I've seen flags multiple comments on the same post. I struggle to see why someone who wants to flag a specific comment thread should be rate-limited, and I really don't see the abuse case here. With both a limit on the number of comments one can flag at once, and the number of flags one can raise, it becomes the same case as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14185/deleting-a-comment-mine-shouldnt-count-as-a-comment-vote"">being rate-limited while deleting comments</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this rep cap isn't the only moving part in what is a complex SO economy.

I suppose the 200 threshold is somehow dependent on how many other key interactions it can translate to (e.g. 20 answer upvotes, 40 question upvotes, etc). However, i) this is speculatory, and ii) then the question simply morphs into 'why was a rep cap chosen that exactly translates to 20 answer upvotes, why not 100 answer upvotes, etc'?</p>

I have legitimate reasons for doing so, but sometimes I worry I am ""fishing"" for easy reputation on popular questions while other hard-working SE users are busy picking up questions from the ""questions"" list.</p>

<p>Is it wrong (or irresponsible) to answer only ""hot questions""?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My SE philosophy is to remain silent unless I am certain I have something to contribute.  I find browsing the list of new questions to be a poor use of my time, since 99% of those are outside my expertise.  As a result, most of my answers end up being for old questions related to topics I am researching, or something that caught my eye on the ""hot questions"" list.</p>

<p>The question isn't remotely on-topic and was rightly, and quickly, put on hold.  Somebody left a comment (not shown) pointing out what Meta.SE is and steering the OP elsewhere.  Sadly, users don't always sit on their questions in real time; sometimes they ask and then come back in a few hours.</p>

<p>If I were to cast that last delete vote, what the OP would see is ""my question disappeared"", with no further feedback unless the page is still open in a browser tab.  The notification for the helpful comment gets removed with the post.  I think only experienced SE users would find (a) the right profile tab and (b) the ""show recent deleted posts"" checkbox. and experienced SE users are not the ones I'm worried about.</p>

<p>How should we respond to these posts?  Is there a reasonable amount of time to wait, and after that we should go ahead and delete it?  If so, how long is reasonable?  Should we just leave these and wait for the Roomba to get them?  If so, then when <em>should</em> we be using delete votes on questions?

<p>There was an answer where I felt it was teetering on the edge of merely NAA and rude &amp; abusive. I downvoted it and cast a delete vote. It was latter destroyed as abusive by a mod.</p>

<p>Now, when people visit that post, they see this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/48yDN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/48yDN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The deletion text implies that <strong>my</strong> reason for voting to delete the answer was because I found it to be ""spam or offensive"". That's not true however. I merely voted to delete. Voting to delete does not allow you to select a reason for deletion, so the system has no way of knowing whether I actually found that or if I just thought it was NAA.</p>

<p>This is of course a minor bug but it can lead to user intent getting misassigned when it actually happens to controversial posts. And it provides a target for the backlash of users who have been affected by such an action, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Who is this Magisch guy and why does he delete my answers as
  offensive?! I'll show em!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's presumably the reason it does not show the flagger names on normal destroyed posts, so it's weird to show the name of someone who didn't actually flag in such a way.</p>

<p>My proposed solution would be to just not list any delete voters besides Community when a post is destroyed before the delete votes take effect. The votes had no impact on the outcome of the post, so I'd say they don't need to be marked as such.</p>

<p>For example, questions that I can answer based on my education and professional experience span at least 5 sites - Stack Overflow, Software Engineering, Software Quality Assurance &amp; Testing, Project Management, and The Workplace. There are even some other sites that have some overlap - Open Source, Law, DevOps, and a few others. Each of these sites have tags for and questions in those tags that my expertise allows me to answer, some with more than others.</p>

<p>Honestly, keeping track of so many sites is a pain for someone who is an expert on a given topic or set of topics and just wants to find questions to answer and get notified of new questions in their area of expertise. These new tools should help a lot on a single site. But it doesn't address when someone's expertise crosses multiple sites.</p>

<p>The RSS feeds are somewhat OK, but I think there are issues with them. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/310015/572"">I posted a possible bug since it looks like my RSS feeds are not including all questions posted to all sites in the feed</a>. Having something on the SE platform seems like it would be better than trying to rely on RSS readers to collate the results and not drop anything. It would also keep people on the platform and be able to react and adapt as new sites are added, without needing to manually update RSS feeds.</p>

<p>The second one has the answer ID of one of the provided answers attached. Why Google chose to request that URL or index that, I don't know. It appears that it doesn't even have to be a valid ID, i.e. you can just request </p>

<pre><code>290943/transmission-daemon-error-loading-working-config-file-user-priveliges/ABC
</code></pre>

<p>and get a perfectly fine 200 OK with no robots meta-tag (or header) and no indication that this isn't the main URL that content is available at.</p>

<p>I've also noticed, that this doesn't happen if you add something to the URL without a leading slash, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>290943/transmission-daemon-error-loading-working-config-file-user-priveligesABC

"313627","Can VLQ flags on answers raised by >2k rep users count as recommend-deletion votes instead of behaving like regular flags?","<p>I've crossed 2k rep on a site and I frequently use the VLQ review queues there. However, I've noticed that there's no change in the system's behavior when I raise VLQ flags: my flags are simply sent to the review queue, just like it was when I had 1k. I think that this shouldn't happen for answers: 2k rep users can cast recommend-deletion votes (on answers) through the review queue, so their VLQ/NAA flags should behave in a similar manner, in addition to bumping the post to the review queue.</p>

<p>This is how I believe the system should behave: when I raise VLQ and NAA flags on answers, I should get the option to leave one of those 'From review' comments with a link to that entry in the review queue, along with the recommend-deletion vote. The review log for that post should automatically display that I've said 'recommend deletion'.</p>

<p>For questions in the VLQ queue, the status quo is appropriate. With less than 3k rep, I can only raise flags, not close votes, which is appropriate. And I think that 3k rep users can cast their close votes almost everywhere, so that's not a problem.</p>

<p>Is there a particular reason why the present system doesn't seem to run this way? If not, can this be changed?</p>

<p><sub> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/148340/recommend-deletion-vs-flagging"">A post on meta</a> said that recommend-deletion votes by 2k rep users push the posts to a 20k deletion queue.

<p>The following events happened to <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/360625"">this question</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>The question was asked being in a very unclear state (IMHO).</li>
<li>I flagged the question for closure (not having the close privilege) due to being unclear and left a comment asking for clarification.</li>
<li>The asker replied to my comment and edited the question. The edited question was still a chaotic mess, but it contained all information needed to solve the puzzle (what the question was about).</li>
<li>The question was closed.</li>
<li>I managed to make sense of the question with the new information and edited the question to make it understandable (IMHO).</li>
<li>The question was not pushed to the reopen queue because I flagged the question in Step 2.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Proposal</h3>

<p>Assuming that my assessment of the qualities of the question are correct (if not, they will be for some other case), this is bad since the question will likely not be brought to the attention of those who could reopen it, even though it should be.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196074"">The respective criterion for pushing to the reopen queue</a> is (boldface mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a closed question will automatically be added to the reopen queue when it is […] [e]dited (body edits only) within 5 days of closure by a 3rd-party, <strong>provided the editor has not also flagged the question or voted to close it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that the boldfaced restriction serves to exclude cases where somebody casts the last close vote and then performs an irrelevant edit or similar.
While this is reasonable, a narrower criterion would suffice to capture this and avoid false positives such as my example case.
It would suffice to refrain from pushing to the reopen queue if the editor has flagged (or voted to close) within, say, half an hour of the edit.</p>

<p>Also note that the boldfaced criterion does not matter that much for users with the close privilege, since they can just cast a reopen vote after performing the crucial edit.
Since I did not have that privilege, I could not do this.</p>

<p>There are links to e.g. scientific papers and code where the author(s) is/are prominently displayed on the linked-to page and the above assumption about the comment-author and the linked-to-page author being the same person is a very natural one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is easy to overlook the buttons, and even if you do notice them, there are no visual cues to tell you that they are clickable.  This is both a user experience failure and an accessibility failure.  Based on my experience trying to salvage insufficiently detailed questions on Stack Overflow, I'm pretty sure that many newcomers to the site don't realize they can edit their questions, so they try to respond in the comments instead, even when what they've been asked to do is, like, provide more code.  And if I take my glasses off, well, I can't read the site at all, but this row of buttons in particular becomes a gray smudge that might be mistaken for a horizontal rule or something.</p>

<p>For questions, I think it might also help to move the tags somewhere else, maybe right under the title.  The design of tags varies from subsite to subsite, but often they look a lot more like buttons than these actual buttons do, so they distract you from them.</p>

At the very least, please make them blue, which is <em>something</em> of a ""this is clickable"" cue.

"314121","Making the left navigation more useful","<p>This post is not about the left navigation bar being annoying or something to disable. Unfortunately we do not seem to have a post about suggestions to make the left navigation more useful now that community sites actually have them and the users have tried to use them (some good proposals have been made in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/309349/left-nav-responsive-design-and-theming-next-steps"">Left nav, responsive design, and theming next steps</a> post).</p>

<p>In this question I will try to get my point across concerning how to make the left navigation more useful on a normal network site with a usually very empty nav bar (I am primarily on tex.stackexchange.com). I will not repeat the ideas mentioned in the linked post where the focus seems to be on tag searches, shortcuts etc. Just for emphasis: I also support the idea of the site selector in the nav bar.</p>

<p>While working with the site's new navigation concept I found two tasks more tedious than I think they need to be when navigating the site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Review. I am not proposing to remove that nice button from the top bar, but maybe you could ease my workflow by removing one click from the process of navigating to another queue. To show what I mean, this is the current situation:<br>
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/r0nLV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/r0nLV.png"" alt=""current situation""></a><br>
While this obviously works, I seem to remember that a <em>navigation bar</em> has been introduced and this context (review) definitely needs an easier navigation path. Hence I would suggest a review navigation field (as an example for context dependent navigation, e.g. while you are at <code>*/review/*</code>) like in the following picture:<br>
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/wqcmZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/wqcmZ.png"" alt=""proposed situation""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Identification. This is basically the same idea as @Raphael's post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314112/it-is-now-all-but-impossible-to-tell-sites-appart-at-a-glance"">It is now all but impossible to tell sites appart at a glance</a> which I just stumbled upon, so I won't go into detail on that. That said I would think that when scrolling down users with non-sticky top bar should get a clue about the community they are visiting and I think that the sticky left navigation would be a great place for this.</p></li>

<p>I think that people shouldn't write an answer if they're not sure it doesn't have wrong information, but can write an answer they're not sure belongs as long as it doesn't have wrong information because some of the time, it will belong and other people can delete it when it doesn't.

I don't question the existing up votes for questions, but I had observed that accepted answers tend to get the most votes -- which I'll admit makes a lot of sense for all the reasons cited in the answer to the linked question.  A lot of factors can go into why someone will up-vote.</p>

<p>The only reason I raise this question is that I caught myself feeling an unbidden urge to up-vote the accepted answer on a question I had just up-voted, even though I hadn't really read the answer to see if it helped me in my particular situation or was particularly well written.  I think, particularly for long time users of SE sites, the green check and reputation bumps begin to become Pavlovian stimuli, creating a positive feedback reward in our minds.  We respond favorably to the shade of green, perhaps.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that we change any mechanics or stats, just that the placement of the green check be reconsidered.  </p>

<p>Does it seem to you that the green check lends some authority to an answer beyond it's content sometimes?  </p>

<p>What if the green check were moved to the right side of a question so that the effect of its proximity to the up/down arrows was limited?</p>

<p>Alternately, what if we changed the color of the check from green to brown, red, purple or some disassociated color?  Would that create confusion or reduce the usability of the design or help dissipate confirmation bias?</p>

<p>I understand that the idea behind the massive redesign is to fix problems like these but a lot of these problems are too severe to wait (in particular, the UX site is practically unusable right now without dismissing the banner because you can't see any of the links to places like ""questions""). </p>

<p>In addition, some of the designs are affected by the increased top bar height, where dismissing the banner doesn't quite fix things completely. I now think this is the cause of <a href=""https://ux.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3234/83293"">another bug that I reported on UX</a>, for example.</p>

<p>This bug affects a number of other sites that I decided not to list, such as the Cooking site, because it's hardly noticeable there. You could call it a literal ""subtle putdown"" :P</p>

"314799","Why we initiated the latest round of design changes and the role of meta","<p>Now seems like a good time to remind ourselves of why we started making dramatic changes to the design of every site on the network. From <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes"">Joe's post on meta</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We're introducing a new product, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/11/09/why-channels/"">Teams</a> (née channels), and doing the requisite <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/12/04/designing-channels/"">research and design thinking</a> to get it right. In addition, early on we realized that we have a unique opportunity to pay off technical debt that prevented us from serving Stack Exchange communities as well as we should have been.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are something like 60 similar, but not compatible themes plus ~100 sites that share the ""beta blue"" theme. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/01/26/year-in-review-2016/"">In 2016</a>, our designers pushed out one design a month in an effort to catch up with the rate sites were graduating. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/31/stack-exchange-2017-review/"">In 2017</a>, we had zero new designs. We've painted ourselves into a corner and need to give our designers some space to work with. We never again want to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/12/04/a-new-top-bar-for-stack-exchange/"">utter the words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that when you try to pick a color to match 40 different site designs, you quickly realize you only have one real choice: black.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get an idea of how the standard theme is implemented, you can look at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.design/product/guidelines/using-stacks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the CSS and pattern library documentation</a>. (We've never had design documentation in the past, in part, because there is so much variation in site design.) <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/253359/list-of-communities-with-base-css-updates-completed"">Standard design frameworks</a> have proved an effective way to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267265/sff-and-mi-yodeya-and-other-sites-without-css-update-are-experiencing-odd-link"">squash long-standing design bugs</a> in the past and I expect the standard theme will eliminate many existing problems and prevent many more in the future.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/265813/give-graduated-sites-waiting-on-a-custom-design-something-to-set-themselves-apar"">Giving sites customized designs</a> is a big part in our ongoing effort to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites"">rationalize the site lifecycle</a>. (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314459/experimenting-with-pro-tempore-elections"">Opening more sites to moderator elections</a> is another piece to the puzzle.) Unique community designs (and, by extention, brands) is one way we can invest in the Stack Exchange network. Not so obvious right now, but a standard theme also allows us to port Stack Overflow-exclusive features to other sites; new features that target Stack Overflow, Enterprise or Teams will probably stay locked into those platforms as long as we don't have a common design to target. </p>

<p>I would have liked these changes to be rolled out with the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312781/custom-question-lists-finding-questions-you-can-answer"">custom question list feature</a>. That would have given everyone something to like about the changes other than a promise of fewer design bugs in the future. I know this state of affairs is not very satisfying.</p>

<h2>How we get feedback</h2>

<p>Reading the responses to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/314089/1438"">What does constructive criticism of a design change look like?</a>, it occured to me that people might not understand where meta feedback is most valuable. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/28/cmon-get-meta/"">Meta was started</a>, in part, due to <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20090522110810/http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com:80/pages/1722-general/suggestions/106921-provide-an-authorized-location-for-meta-discussion-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my suggestion on UserVoice</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know this has been declined multiple times, but I really think it's time to consider the problem of meta-discussions on the site. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In those day, nearly a decade ago, Stack Overflow was growing quickly and active users were an important source of ideas and feature requests. But, as you can see from the quote, most suggestions were declined. Usually they were declined with no explanation or terse pronouncements. Meta, by contrast, has turned out to be incredibly useful for working out certain types of features like <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305893/what-criteria-should-we-use-to-determine-which-review-queue-indicator-a-site-wil"">the review queue indicator</a>. It gives developers and users space to discuss the workings of the site in detail. <strong>Reasoned arguments on meta provide feedback that can't be reproduced elsewhere.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, we haven't always used that space to its best advantage. Jeff has talked about this in <a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/listen-to-your-community-but-dont-let-them-tell-you-what-to-do/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Listen to Your Community, But Don't Let Them Tell You What to Do</a>. In contrast to his habit of declining suggestions quickly, we've swung to the opposite extreme. Ideas languish on meta. Once in a while, we'll dig up an old idea, but more often your hard work convincing us to do something goes unanswered. That doesn't mean it lacks value, however. When I wrote that UserVoice suggestion, I just wanted to have a place for meta-discussions even if the company ignored them.  </p>

<p>In the last couple of years, we've cultivated other types of feedback. For instance, the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/08/information-architecture-navigating-stack-overflow-enterprise-stack-exchange-sites/"">blog post that introduced the navigation changes</a> incorporated feedback from user interviews. From these tests, we can observe what happens when people try to use the interface. <a href=""http://jericson.github.io/2016/06/30/usability_tests.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Direct feedback as people learn</a> about the changes can only be reproduced on meta if the user is very diligent to record their own experiences in detail. Even then, it'd be just one of the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">~5 individuals</a> you need for good results. Since we do user interviews more frequently than in the past, we often have a good idea of what does or does not work in the UI before presenting it to meta.</p>

<p>We also use A/B tests and usage statistics. In the case of the left-hand sidebar, it's easy to spot when we made the change on Stack Overflow:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/vZGOQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vZGOQ.png"" alt=""Stack Overflow navigation usage""></a></p>

<p>Meta feedback such as ""I have a hard time finding the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions"">questions page</a>"" is especially useful if the data shows this is a common problem. If your concern happens to be less common, it requires more information about what makes your use case notable. Even then, it might be impossible to fix without breaking something for others.</p>

<p>By the way, the other sites that have <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes"">received the new theme</a> show a pattern unlike Stack Overflow:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xXIny.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xXIny.png"" alt=""Non-SO navigation usage""></a></p>

<p>Since Stack Overflow is a critical part of many programmers' workflow, we get criticism from outside the community. Traditionally, we've ignored that input because people who are not active on the sites tend not to understand how the sausage is made. Recently, however, we've <a href=""https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heard criticism</a> that we've taken to heart and responded to. If you can find the truth buried within <a href=""https://twitter.com/thedimishra/status/934988697107185664"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">misunderstandings of outsiders</a> it can be useful to hear from the largely-silent majority of people who use the site passively.</p>

<p>Finally, there are internal considerations such as input from other parts of the business. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/08/information-architecture-navigating-stack-overflow-enterprise-stack-exchange-sites/"">Adding navigation support for Teams</a> was a key reason we embarked on this round of changes, if you recall. We strive for transparency, but don't always succeed. Then there are trivial issues like the way our code is structured or people going on vacation or disagreements about how to do things that can have outsized effects on what we are able to do. Sometimes we fail to predict what information is most relevant. </p>

<h2>Working with you to improve the feedback cycle</h2>

<p>The sense I get from reading answers and comments here is that the frustration many of you feel stems from a lack of agency over the features, design and operation of the site(s) you love. The express goal of the standard theme is to support Teams, a feature many people will never get to use and probably will never be deployed to most sites. I'd guess everyone who uses meta regularly has a pet feature or bug that they wish we'd spend time on.</p>

<p>In addition, while the change will help sites without designs get their own distinctive brand in time, the predominate effect so far has been to <em>water down existing site designs</em>. Since Stack Overflow was the base upon which the standard was built, sites like Math and TeX look a lot more like Stack Overflow than they used to. And let's not underestimate the very real cost changing a UI has on people. <strong>It should be no surprise that people feel angry and helpless.</strong></p>

<p>Both the DAG and community teams are working on ways to make the transition less shocking and get important feedback sooner as we continue converting sites to the standard theme. To <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/373227/1438"">quote Tim</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We're still a growing and relatively small company with limited resources. While we don't struggle and thrash around in the name of profitability, we're still going to struggle and thrash around as we encounter even scarier problems that come with becoming more established. We're <em>way</em> more public and open than anyone else and as you can see, it has been a heck of a ride. We wish we could do everything, right now, and make everyone happy. We'll get there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know how companies that put you on hold always say ""Your call is very important to us""? Yeah, I don't believe it either. Then again, you gotta feel for them since many companies <em>do</em> care about keeping customers happy, but can't afford to have a call center full of people waiting around to give individualized service. So they gotta say <em>something</em> while you wait. Fortunately, as a software company, we can do more than ask you to reboot your router (as my ISP invariably asks). Sometimes we can <a href=""https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fix things twice</a> and get at the root problem.</p>

<p>At any rate, we can do better and maybe you have some practical ideas. How can we serve you better while still meeting our goal to standardize all 174 site themes? </p>

"315100","""Framing not allowed"" when using back button or re-opening closed tab in google chrome when logged in","<p>First: I <strong>only</strong> have this issue on security.stackexchange.com, not on other sites (at least not on the few that I have tried), and only if I'm logged in.  I get the ""Framing not allowed"" error message when doing some pretty ""normal"" browsing.  The fact that it only happens for me on security.stackexchange.com when logged in makes me suspect that it is a bug and not just a quirk of my browser, hence why I'm here.  Specifically, I get that error message (followed by a page refresh and normal site operation) if I do one of the following two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to security.stackexchange.com, click on any question, and then hit the back button in my browser (it also happens if the back button takes me back to a previous question instead of the site home page).</li>
<li>Be on the security main page or any question page, close the tab, and then use chrome to re-open the most recently opened tab.</li>
</ol>

"315107","Should I post ""milestones"" to questions I'm working on?","<p>I sometimes spend a long time working on answers to questions (eg, weeks or months). Sometimes I reach a ""milestone"" when answering that still isn't a complete answer, but may have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It lets the OP know that someone's working on the question and have had some level of success.</p></li>
<li><p>It lets the OP indicate if the direction I'm moving in is right or wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>It lets the OP say ""someone else answered this somewhere else, I no longer need the answer"".</p></li>
<li><p>It may entice others to contribute more to the answer, help me with my answer, or make corrections to my milestone-not-answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, I just get tired of working on a question. By posting a milestone, people have at least something (""this is as far as I got, maybe someone else can get further""). However, it's not always permanent. I may do more work on the question and want to post the additional work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Solutions I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do nothing until I have a real answer. Despite what I think, the steps I'm taking and milestones I'm reaching are not of interest to others.</p></li>
<li><p>Post the first milestone as an answer, and then update the answer with each new milestone. This lets the OP (and others) get information as quickly as I can find it, but it appears that the OP and others wouldn't receive notifications when I update the answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Post each milestone as a different answer. This makes me cringe, since it could be seen as an attempt to garner reputation.</p></li>
<li><p>Post the answer on my blog, link to my blog, and, in the blog entry itself, ask people to subscribe to the RSS feed for that entry, so they can be notified when I update it. I've read other posts on this subject and know it's acceptable, but it seems really unfriendly if Stack is a ""source of knowledge"" instead of a ""source of links to knowledge"".</p></li>

<p>It looks redundant, since tags seem to be the best mean to put a context of the question. I believe short, concise and key-wordish titles are more preferrable, so I'd rather make the title like this and let tags say the rest:</p>

<p>But little to no discussion to cope with people failing to understand how to use comment flags or abusing them altogether. I'm not sure many users are even aware if their comment flags have been declined (a UI issue). But a pop up message or ban, in whatever way possible may assist.</p>

<p>Certainly as a mod, it can be hard to track someone's comment flagging, it depends on who's handling the queues at that time. Without looking at a user's history, we have no idea how many declined flags a user has or when they were. A person persistently flagging another user (targeted flagging) does tend to come to our notice, but it's still reliant on keen observation.</p>

<p>Can we at the least institute automatic or  manual comment flag suspensions for declined comment flags? Or an auto mod flag that a user has X declined comment flags (similar for users who have too many rude or unkind flags) so we at least know to go and investigate that user?</p>

<p>My only hesitation in asking this, is comments are supposed to be second class citizens and to implement this may require a bit of dev time for the network. I'm not sure how messy this will be on top of the teams current todo list.</p>

<p>When I am on the active questions tab of a site, I find that the blue links are hard to distinguish from the light blue links that I have already followed, especially on a mobile device. I think there should be an option to change the default link colors in the settings menu.</p>

<p>I am not colorblind, and I consider myself to have good vision, but it can still be hard to see whether I have clicked the link before if I am using a small screen.

<p>As far as I get it, this option exists for users who do not want to expose their involvement in a certain community (in the discussion I linked to, the idea was to use Stack Overflow to make yourself more appealing for potential employers in the field of software engineering without disclosing your involvement in subjects that may seem controversial, such as politics). However, as C. Helling pointed out in that discussion - hiding a community may remove it from your profile in a site, but it would still be visible in your network profile. </p>

<p>Doesn't this miss the point? Should a hidden community be hidden from the network profile too?</p>

  <li>Click Create.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/params"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Duck Duck Go</a> says that duckduckgo.com is the domain and <code>q</code> is the query parameter.  E.g. <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=search"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=search</a></p>

<p>There have been <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/258390/229547"">previous questions</a> asking <em>why</em> Duck Duck Go appears as a search engine.  I'm not asking that.  I understand that this is based on Google's categorization.  The point is that it is possible to change Google's categorization.  This has been requested previously (e.g. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/258390/why-is-duckduckgo-com-listed-as-referrer-rather-than-search-engine-on-analytics#comment862962_258402"">here</a>), but it's not clear that it has made its way to staff consciousness.  </p>

<p>As an example of why I want this, look at the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/258390/229547"">Politics.SE Site Analytics page</a> (probably requires super permissions, either moderator or 5k rep on Politics).  Currently, DuckDuckGo.com would be the third largest search engine after Google and Bing (and before Yahoo!).  </p>

<p>Many of the forty search engines recognized by Google are not English language.  As such, they may not appear much in referrals to Stack Exchange.  Duck Duck Go may be more impactful for Stack Exchange than Russian language search engines.  They offer this customization for a reason.  Why not take advantage of it?  </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:  If it is unclear, I am recommending that the Stack Exchange person responsible for configuring Google Site Analytics to add DuckDuckGo.com as an additional search engine.  Directions in the quoted material, with relevant information added immediately afterwards.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my son’s favourite zoo, there is a goat-petting area with a double-door system to allow humans to access the area without the goats getting out.</p>
  
  <p>Now, I often find myself in the situation that some other visitors were careless and allowed some goat to get between the two doors.
  Since there often is no personnel around (and I am bored), I want to resolve this situation by nudging the goats back into their area.
  However, they often are stubborn as, well, goats, and I do not want to harm them by applying too much force.</p>
  
  <p>What is the best way to move such a goat?</p>

<p>So far I considered the following sites for this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Pets</a></strong>, however, the goats in question are no “animal companions that are cared for in a domestic setting”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">The Great Outdoors</a></strong>, however, I am not encountering these goats in free nature and they are likely quite different in behaviour from free-ranging goats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Travel</a></strong>, however, this is not about anything listed on the site’s scope. All <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zoos"">questions about zoos</a> seem to be enquiring about the existence or travelling to certain zoos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Biology</a></strong>, however, my question is very applied to what most biologists care about. It would be like asking a question about repairing my bicycle on Physics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Lifehacks</a></strong>, however, my question is a “conventional <em>‘how to…’</em> question about skills that can commonly be learned elsewhere”, namely when training to be a goat herder or petting-zoo attendant.</p></li>

I mean listing those questions tagged as <a href=""/questions/tagged/faq"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;faq&#39;"" rel=""tag"">faq</a> at the right panel of child meta.</p>

"315780","Does the new unified design theme result in more off-topic questions where lost users asked on the wrong site?","<p>This is partially a request for opinion, and partially a request for statistics.</p>

<p>For a very long time, Meta Stack Exchange has suffered from a problem where a lot of users ask blatantly off-topic questions here, such as programming questions. One of the reasons for posting off-topic questions here, as pointed out in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305749/why-do-users-often-ask-blatantly-off-topic-questions-here-on-meta/305752#305752"">my answer</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/278592/377214"">Tim Post's answer</a>, is that users follow a link here, not realize they've been directed to a different site, and then ask their (off-topic) question here.</p>

<p>Both answers were posted during a time when each site had unique design elements. Even then, users would go to another site, not realize they've been cross-linked, and ask an (off-topic) question. Now that many more site design elements have been standardized, it's possible that this could become a far more common occurrence (not just for Meta Stack Exchange, but for all sites). Even as a seasoned SE user, I've occasionally missed that I'm on a different site when I've navigated between sites where the new design has rolled out.</p>

<p>To be honest, this is my only gripe towards unifying site design elements; otherwise, I'm all for doing this if it means that the code base is more maintainable.</p>

<p>Is my analysis of this issue correct? Would having unified design elements result in more off-topic questions from lost users? Has this actually happened? Finally, if so, what can be done to reduce the incidence of lost users?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MzXN9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MzXN9.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of edit message""></a></p>

<p>Now imagine that you are editing a long post and you have corrected a dozen spelling mistakes, or other such minor things. If the edit that was saved while you were doing that was significant enough, you won't be able to save your edit even though none of the things you corrected were addressed by the other edit.</p>

<p>So, if you still want to make all those corrections you have to reopen the question and then manually make all the edits again. But wait! What if you simply don't remember all the edits that you were making? What if it took you fifteen minutes to find all those problems? You now have to start over, reading through the post again to find the issues. This might be a big waste of time.</p>

<p>(Of course you could copy and paste the entire post from the box where you were editing it, and then open up another version of the post and individually copy and paste all the changes made by the saved edit into your version. But that could also take time, and I somehow imagine something going wrong when copying and pasting thousands of characters.)</p>

<p>It would be very simple to redo the edit if there was a way to see the changes you made even without being able to save them. The same way you can access the revision history <em>after</em> an edit is saved, and see what was changed, you should be able to see a summary of your changes <strong>even if they can't be saved</strong>. This way you would be able to quickly see all the changes you made, and redo them in the blink of an eye.</p>

The main reason the new design isn't working well for me is that the new left nav combines with the pre-existing right column (which now must all fit on-screen) to squish the core content.  But there's not a lot of content in these two columns -- so for most of the page, there isn't any content in <em>either</em> column:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/zomNG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/zomNG.png"" alt=""screenshot with nothing in either column about 35% of the way down the page""></a></p>

<p>So we have two columns that don't have a lot of content in them, but they ""stake out"" their entire widths of the page all the way down.</p>

<p>What are the design considerations for combining them into <em>one</em> side column?</p>

<p>I'm sure the design team must have considered this question.  I'm not a designer and it's not obvious to me why to prefer two sidebars over one.  Could you enlighten me?  It feels like we could better use the vertical space to then allow Q&amp;A to have more horizontal space, which is particularly helpful for smaller displays (like tablets) and poorer vision (thus font zoom).</p>

<p>Right now I collapse the left column to get more room for Q&amp;A, but I'd prefer to have those links readily available.  Besides, I know you're planning to put some more stuff in the left column that I might care about.  But I do use my browser for other things (really!), so ""make the window bigger"" doesn't really work 'cause it'll mess up other stuff.  Also, I can't make my tablet bigger.</p>

<p><strong>A request to the community:</strong> The new design stirs up all kinds of emotions (me too).  I'm trying to ask a constructive question to better understand this design choice.  I'd appreciate it if we could try to avoid super-heated responses.</p>

"316408","Enthusiast/Fanatic badge progress does not reset until you log in","<p>Something I discovered recently is that the ""progress to next badge"" tracker is visible on the ""activity"" tab of other users' profiles (showing whichever badge they've set as their next badge to be aiming for). This feature makes it possible to see your badge progress for a consecutive-days badge while logged out. (You can't use the consecutive-days count in your <em>profile</em>, the better-known place for it, because that isn't visible while logged out.)</p>

<p>I've been intentionally trying to avoid the Enthusiast/Fanatic badges, so I take a day away from Stack Exchange every now and then to reset them. Previously I did this by just counting the day manually, but it struck me that this indicator might be an easier way to see when the progress reset. After not logging into Stack Exchange for several days, I began to suspect that something was up.</p>

<p>It turns out that as long as you don't log into your account, the badge progress on Enthusiast and Fanatic freezes in place (thus showing a misleading value, as actually logging in will reset it to zero).</p>

<p>The most obvious fix I can think of to this situation is simply to hide badge progress except when viewing your own profile when logged in; this has <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/250562/347902"">already been suggested by another user</a> on the basis that it's a privacy leak (as badge progress isn't always visible by other means). Another argument against it is that as it relies on the ""next badge"" setting made by the user in question (while logged out, you can't change it to inspect the progress from other badges), any potential use of it would be somewhat inconsistent (most people don't think of their ""next badge"" setting as being one which has effects on other people, and thus you're effectively being shown one particular badge progress report for the user in question chosen in an arbitrary manner). Given the comparative uselessness of the feature ­– and the way it makes some users uncomfortable – removing it may make more sense than going through the effort to fix bugs in it.</p>

<p>If the count is to be shown, though, it should at least be accurate.</p>

"316477","Can the tour page be reformed and can moderators be allowed to fine-tune it?","<p>Before anything, this should be made clear: I am not currently a moderator on any Stack Exchange sites; most of what I will be proposing here is based on statements I myself have read from moderators (namely <a href=""https://latin.stackexchange.com/users/79/joonas-ilmavirta"">@JoonasIlmavirta</a> in the <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/47080627#47080627"">CONLOQVIVM</a> chat room).</p>

<p>I'm not going to beat around the bush: the tour page is a bit of a mess. The information usually provided under <em>""Get answers to practical, detailed questions""</em>, <em>""You earn reputation when people vote on your posts""</em>, <em>""You earn reputation when people vote on your posts""</em>, and <em>""Unlock badges for special achievements""</em> is fine; explaining what is on-topic and off-topic and explaining the relatively simple aspects of the site (those being badges, voting, reputation, and others). </p>

<p>The problems begin to appear in the sections where example questions, answers, and comments appear; questions and answers which fit a set of arbitrary requirements appear to moderators in a list, from which moderators can then select a few, or in the case of comments, one. This presents a number of problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Often it is the case with many sites that short posts are rarely good (take Code Review as an example, short reviews are <em>rarely</em> good; short questions are <em>sometimes</em> well-written, but not often).</li>
<li>By extension of point one, short posts are often not demonstrative of what a quality question or answer might be.</li>
<li>Comments are cut from their context, which has the potential to be quite confusing to a new user reading the tour page. Take for example the provided comment under the <em>""Improve posts by editing or commenting""</em> section on the <a href=""https://latin.stackexchange.com/tour"">Latin.SE tour page</a>: it makes little sense and does not serve as a good example with its context removed.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, there are several problems with how the tour page presents the moderator-selected questions and answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Question and answer votes are randomized, which removes one of the only true indicators of what a quality question or answer actually is, more so in the case of answers. </li>
<li>The accepted answer for the example question under <em>""Ask questions, get answers, no distractions""</em>, like vote counts, is randomized, again removing one of the only indicators of quality. Why?</li>
</ol>

<p>With all this said, I propose the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allow moderators to select <strong>any</strong> question they deem to be good, regardless of length.</li>
<li>From that selected question, allow moderators to select <strong>any</strong> answers they deem good, once again, regardless of length.</li>
<li>If any of the selected questions and answers are too long to display in a clean manner, simply fade out the text into the display box and provide a ""show more"" button, which can either link to the original question or simply expand the display box.</li>
<li>Allow moderators to select multiple comments, so that context can be included.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> randomize vote counts or the accepted answer. The point of voting and accepting is to help determine the best questions and answers; randomizing them goes completely against this. </li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/oTqn9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/oTqn9.png"" alt=""sidebar""></a></p>

<p>The sidebar could be helpful, but it has too few useful links, which makes it a waste of space. One possible use of all of this space is in going from a meta site to the parent site. Currently, the easiest way to get from a meta site to the parent site is by using the menu on the top right.</p>

<p>For me, that means moving the mouse over to the button, pressing it, waiting for the menu to pop up, and having to scan over the communities to get to the current community. As soon as my eyes have moved there, the sites list loads, making me involuntarily look down to see what the motion is. Then I have to remember exactly what I was doing, look back at the communities list, move the mouse over to the parent site and click it.</p>

<p>I know this isn't a major inconvenience, but I think that the side menu could speed up this process.</p>

<p>Messing around with the Inspect tool, I created these two screenshots of what the sidebar might look like with the new link. Keep in mind that I am neither a professional developer nor a UX expert, so the link could be moved below the home link and/or change to look like the links below.</p>

"316869","Remove ""Go get it"" for Research Assistant","<p>This request is a follow up to my question <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/310891/357396"">&quot;Go get it&quot; link is broken for Research Assistant and some other badges</a>. </p>

<p>I found out from Brain Nickel's answer that it is not a bug but intended behaviour. When we click on Go get it, we are redirected to tag notification section in our preferences. If there are no watched tags, it takes us to <a href=""/tags"">Tags</a>. </p>

<p>Brian Nickel explained logic behind this in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311135/357396"">his answer</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exact logic is: if the user has any favorite tags, go to the list of favorite tags, otherwise, go to /tags. I expect the logic was that users would be best equipped to edit wikis for tags they're interested in. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there is a problem here. In spite of detailed wikis, we are still redirected to wikis. Even if we submit a detailed wiki when there is no wiki, the result is same. We are redirected to watched tags.</p>

<p>This is not helpful. Having Go get it link serves no purpose if that happens. Hence I propose two possible solutions. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Redirecting all the users to tags section irrespective of watched tags.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing 'go get it' option from Research assistant.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Select a better option between two. In my opinion, second one seems plausible as it reduces strain on database.</p>

Say 10 full up-down cycles in all, as a short burst.</p>

<p>It felt a bit spooky, as if someone was trying to ""send me a message"" and that's weird because there's never been a case of non-verbal communication in SE ;-)</p>

"317976","In the annual rep league, why isn't the difference between rep earned this year and total rep always the same?","<p>In the <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/leagues/4/year/meta/2018-01-01/377214#377214"">annual rep league</a> here on Meta Stack Exchange, it shows that I've earned 9,876 rep this year, and 10,359 rep overall. (It's updated every day at 0:00 UTC, and I so far have earned 1 rep today, since an answer I downvoted a while ago was deleted.)</p>

<p>The difference between my total rep and the rep I earned this year is 483, which means 483 of the rep I've earned is rep I earned in 2017 or earlier. This amount normally never changes, though I can see some reasons why it might change, such as if rep is recalculated and something affects a rep event occurring in a previous year (e.g. a vote from last year was invalidated due to user deletion, a post I made at that time was deleted or undeleted, etc.)</p>

<p>This amount, 483, was a recent change; it used to be 461. Ordinarily, I'd chalk this up to a rep event from last year being recalculated, but I've gone through my full rep history and I can see nothing of the sort happening. On the other hand, on the same day that this number changed from 461 to 483, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/315246/how-can-we-solve-the-problem-of-misinformed-reopen-reviews-as-a-result-of-edits"">this post of mine</a> was undeleted, recalculating my rep and giving me back 22 (which happens to equal 483-461). It therefore makes sense if that post was from a previous year. However, the post is from <strong>this</strong> year, so it doesn't make very much sense.</p>

<p>Is there a bug in the way yearly rep in the rep league is calculated, in that rep regained from an undeleted post made the same year is not re-added to the rep earned this year (while it is subtracted properly upon deletion)? Or is there some other event that occurred in the three weeks before 2018 that I had my account that caused this difference to change, that I'm not seeing, and the change being equal to that is just a coincidence?</p>

This is despite the fact that the question is <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126587/what-is-a-historical-lock-and-what-is-it-used-for"">historically locked</a>. Obviously, this situation is very confusing to new or casual users: the question was posted just a few hours ago, is somehow apparently already historically significant, and is of a rather lower quality than a duplicate question that already exists (and yet is not closed as duplicate).</p>

<p>What seems to have happened is that the moderators of the site wanted a short question with short answers to use on the ""site tour"" page (i.e. the <a href=""/questions/tagged/about-page"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;about-page&#39;"" rel=""tag"">about-page</a>), and thus created an edited-down version of an existing question, voting on it in order to create a plausible-looking vote total: good answers would be too long, so some much more perfunctory answers were added (and ones which failed to cover the full topic). As such, the voting on the page is (probably) entirely artificial (with the question at 5 points and answers at 3 each); apparently, this was enough to set off the Hot Network Questions algorithm.</p>

<p>This situation raises several worrying points:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to create an example for a help page, a site had to post an actual, live question. The question itself sets a very bad example: the question is short; the answers are short, when they could be longer and more informative; the answers fail to cover the entirety of the subject, and thus give a misleading impression; the question is a duplicate, but not closed as duplicate. So Stack Exchange is promoting some of the worst content of the linked site.</li>
<li>In order to keep the example in the desired state, the site had to apply a historical lock to it, despite the fact that the description used for a historical lock doesn't match at all. This is a frequently seen issue on Stack Exchange: that moderators have to use locks with misleading descriptions, simply because no other lock has the desired functionality. The resulting situation is very confusing for a user who's less experienced with Stack Exchange and doesn't realise what has happened.</li>
<li>The question in question was locked with, apparently, an entirely artificial vote count; in other words, the rating it has is the result of voting manipulation, rather than actual users. Presumably, this manipulation was not detected or reverted by the site software; and yet, some simple and easily accomplished vote manipulation was sufficient to trigger the Hot Network Questions algorithm. This implies that anyone willing to indulge in a small amount of voting fraud can have their own Hot Network Question whenever they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>More interestingly, this question also illustrates quite a bit about how Hot Network Questions become hot in the first place; 5 question votes, two answers, and 6 answer votes were enough to trigger the hotness algorithm. (Normally it's not possible to see the vote count that triggered HNQ in the first place, because the prominence in the side bar attracts a large number of 101-reputation users who, on average, upvote the question and its answers (they can't downvote). Because this question was locked almost immediately, we can see a vote count which is closer to the count it would have had at the time it hit Hot Network Questions.)</p>

<p>Despite the interesting insight into the HNQ algorithm that this question has given us, incidents like this are likely to be worth avoiding in future (and if this really is the only way to get a usable tour page, then it's likely to be repeated once per site as other sites catch on); we're promoting some of the worst content of the site to new users (in both the HNQ bar and the tour page), and the trigger for this occurring is something that could easily be accomplished accidentally by well-meaning moderators (as happened in this case), or intentionally via malicious users (and would likely be hard to detect; in the case where the question hadn't been immediately locked, the drive-by upvotes from curious visitors would quickly overwhelm the manipulated votes in noise and make it hard to see that anything had happened). How can we stop something like this happening again?</p>

"318288","Cross-site favourites list for mobile apps","<p>The mobile apps, both for Android and iOS, would be far better suited to actually help answer questions if they had a list of questions that the user „starred“. There are some questions around here asking for such a listing, but it seemed it fell by the wayside some time around 2014 (see, e.g., <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/233752/favourites-page-on-ios-app"">Favourites Page on iOS App</a>). </p>

<p>Currently, the only way to even get at one‘s favourites is the very unintuitive and rather hidden saved-search approach described in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/243538"">https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/243538</a>, but that is restricted to individual sites.</p>

<p>I would suggest offering the user a central place for all their starred questions <em>across all sites</em>, which would be a bit different than these older proposals.</p>

<p>I would see the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the current „mark as favourite“ action in the app would not feel so write-only (question to the app‘s maintainers: do you have numbers on how many users use the saved-search trick to get their favourites?)</p></li>
<li><p>the list could be used to gather helpful advice for users who frequent several sites professionally (an admin might, e.g., want to collect articles from Serverfault, Unix/Linux, Superuser and Webapps in one place)</p></li>
<li><p>the list could be used to gather articles for researching a „proper answer“ when a mobile user is back at his or her workstation („I found this interesting problem on the train, but I‘ll need my Linux lab machine to work out a solution“)</p></li>

<p>Much too often, a newer questioner will choose a ""best answer"" within hours (or sometimes minutes) of submitting a question. This is frustrating for many reasons and discourages people from submitting new answers.</p>

<p>I realize people disagree but I find that I often don't bother to leave an answer when a best answer has already been chosen, even if my answer will be different from any of the published ones.</p>

<p>I've also seen the best answer change rapidly. In those and other cases, sometimes the questioner will comment that s/he didn't know that s/he could only pick one answer. In other words, questioners sometimes can't tell the difference between a best answer and an upvote.</p>

<p>I know that the prevailing wisdom is to wait 48 hours. But most people don't know or don't care (I've also been told by questioners that they choose a best answer to get the rep points, even though waiting would not change that).</p>

<p>I will note that the system makes you wait 48 hours before accepting your own answer to your question.</p>

<p>Is there a way to build in a waiting period? Or a pop-up that asks ""are you sure?"" before the person can proceed? Or a note on the question itself?</p>

<p>One example: <a href=""https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/40346/what-is-the-character-called-that-is-only-there-so-we-can-have-information-from"">What is the character called that is only there so we can have information from the main characters?</a></p>

<p>In this case, the questioner chose the first (and only) answer very quickly. A couple of hours at most. But the first answer is wrong. A second answer, with correct information, came up and is languishing. Had the questioner waited, he still might have chosen the first question, and that would be his right, but I don't think he would have.</p>

<p>Is there a way we can make this process better?  It's one thing if questioners choose answers most people wouldn't have chosen.  But the real issue is that most questioners don't understand what the checkmark means or how to use it.</p>

<p>(Note: this question is echoed in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/290281/wait-to-select-best-answer"">Wait To Select Best Answer</a> but that question asks ""Are there cases in which it is preferable to not select a best answer at all?"" which is not what I'm asking.)</p>

"319189","Preferred link reference format in questions and answers?","<p>Which is the preferred way to format references in question and answer texts?<br />I have now seen 3 variations:</p>

<pre><code>[visible text](url)
[visible text][n]
     with n being a number and then at the bottom the actual reference:
     [n]: URL
[visible text][linkref]
    with linkref being a text to the actual reference:
    [linkref]: URL
    (Visually but not technically different from the second format)
</code></pre>

<p>Thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>I usually use the first format when editing because it lets me edit the raw text in place.<br />And anyone editing this always has the text and URL in view <em>together</em>.</li>
<li>The second format is the more traditional 'reference' that we all know from footnotes/endnotes</li>
<li>I came across the 3rd format in a suggested edit review and this interrupted my thought process: <em>Wait, what's this - O, it's a link reference</em>. I find this format unclear because the link text and link URL have no visual distinction other than their relative position.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<li>This is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22581/what-is-the-preferred-link-format-in-questions-and-answers"">What is the preferred link format in questions and answers?</a>, because that is about the link text, not the link reference. </li>

<p>The help and the review icons are gone now. Which is the expected behaviour for a responsive design, and as I'm familiar with this concept, I'd simply look into the hamburger menu that contains the overflow menu items. </p>

<p>There are several issues with this in the new SE design. There isn't a single hamburger menu here, <strong>there are three of them</strong> (credit goes to Sklivvz for <a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4285/5"">noticing this first</a> and pointing me towards this issue). </p>

<p>Well, two of them look a bit like the SE logo, but they're still very similar in design to a hamburger menu, and ones of them actually works similar to one. And the other issue is that <strong>not a single one of those three hamburger menus actually contains the overflowing top bar items</strong>. As far as I can tell, the icons that are hidden due to a lack of space simply disappear, there is no way to reach them in this case.</p>

It was only at that time that the question was automatically protected. However, according to the FAQ, questions are automatically protected after receiving just three deleted answers from new users.</p>

<p>Why wasn't this question protected upon the third deleted answer? All of the deleted answers are from different users, and while the question was migrated from Stack Overflow, all of the deleted answers were posted <em>long</em> after the migration.</p>

<p>I can think of three possible causes:</p>

<ol>
<li>One of the older new user answers was posted by a user with the association bonus, so it's possible that it wasn't considered towards the check as it only checks for 10+ rep, without subtracting 100 for users with the bonus like the answering check does.</li>
<li>One of the deleted answers was deleted in review, and since that didn't generate a deletion revision history item in the past (thus allowing for the author to undelete it), it may not be being counted.</li>
<li>Two of the deleted answers were self-deleted, and self-deleted answers may be exempt. (Not possible, since if it were the case, it wouldn't have been auto-protected until the next deleted new-user answer.)</li>

<p>I'm leaning towards cause 1, but which one is it, or is it something totally different? Is it easy to fix?</p>

If you follow that link you get various statistics relating to the top users of that tag. On the side of that page, though, is a list of ""related tags"". For some reason, the top related tag is always the tag itself. E.g. if you are on the ""top users"" page for <a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a> the first tag displayed under ""related tags"" is <a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a>.</p>

<p>This seems a bit odd — the point of ""related tags"" is to show <em>other</em> similar tags, not the very tag that you are already viewing. Can this be fixed so that ""related tags"" only displays actual related tags and not the current tag itself?</p>

<p>Note, It is apparently only under the ""top users"" page the ""synonyms"" page, the ""hot"" page, and the ""new"" page that the tag itself appears as a related tag; on other pages that display related tags, such as the main page of a tag, the tag itself <em>does not</em> appear. </p>

<p>First, in the answer sorting tabs - active, votes, and newest. If I <kbd>tab</kbd> to any of these buttons, there's no indication that the focus is there - I have to look at the bottom of the page to see that it's pointing to a link, and then based on the end of the URL see what button currently has focus to be able to change the sorting.</p>

<p>Another place is when you open the image uploader. You can open the uploader with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>, and the focus automatically will go to ""browse"" (so when you press <kbd>enter</kbd> you'll be able to find your image and upload it), but you can't visually tell that that's where the focus is.</p>

<p>And the third example is deleting your own comment. I can <kbd>tab</kbd> to the delete button, but the button remains invisible and you can't see that the focus is there at all.</p>

<p>There are probably more examples, but these are the three that I noticed.</p>

"320555","How should I flag blatantly off-topic questions on Meta.SE: Close or VLQ?","<p>Historically, when encountering blatantly off-topic questions (usually programming questions) here on Meta.SE, I would raise a <em>Close</em> flag (usually <strong>off-topic</strong>: <em>This question does not appear to be about the software that powers the Stack Exchange network, within the scope defined in the help center.</em>).</p>

<p>With the recent ""flood"" of off-topic questions that suddenly seemed to pick up this fall, I started to wonder if I should be using the <em>Very Low Quality</em> (VLQ) flag instead. Guidance on Meta.SO indicates that VLQ is <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/265596/6471538"">""for things that warrant immediate deletion""</a>. I noticed that off-topic questions here tend to get deleted rather <em>quickly</em>. George Stocker, a mod on SO, <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/314663/6471538"">mentioned</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By flagging something as very low quality, you're asking for a straight pass to moderator deletion. No editing, putting 'on hold' by 5 members of the community, deleted by 3, or voting allowed. You want a moderator to skip that entire process because the question is so terrible that there's no way it could ever be salvaged through that process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to describe the actual behavior I see here on Meta.SE - since off-topic questions get deleted quickly (within two or three hours), I began to wonder whether the speedy deletion is actually signaling to me that there is a real desire to get these questions <em>gone</em> from this site <em>as quickly as possible</em>, as opposed to leaving them around in a closed state waiting to be improved (or not), gathering further downvotes. In other words, off-topic questions on Meta.SE really are considered so ""terrible"" that they deserve a ""straight pass"" to deletion.</p>

<p>I'm not really concerned about declined flags - my <em>helpful</em> rate for flagging these kind of posts is very high, and doesn't seem to vary based on whether I raise <em>Close</em> or <em>VLQ</em>, so I'm really asking about best practices. What's the consensus here on <em>Meta.SE</em>? Are off-topic ""omg my code no work"" questions bad enough to warrant a VLQ flag, or should I use Close only? Which would be more efficient to the particular processes used on <em>this</em> site?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/DKpyb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DKpyb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>This same behavior should apply when editing a question (On GitHub also does this). On this case, if the question is small enough it already fits on the text editor view area without a scroll bar, do nothing. But if the questions body is bigger than the standard text editor size, expand it up to the maximum view size, only then add a scroll bar.</p>

<h3>Conflicting</h3>

<p>As someone will probably complain, the GitHub and StackExchange websites text editor have a main difference, GitHub has a <code>Preview</code> button, while StackExchange directly shows the <code>Preview</code> just bellow the text editor, related to an WYSIWYG text editor.</p>

<p>On this case, when I say <code>expand the editor up to the view size</code>, it should also consider the space taken by <code>WYSIWYG Preview</code> area, and not literally expand to the full extend of the view area.</p>

<p>Now a problem rises when the editor text is very big and the preview area is also very big. How it should expand? For me, the text editor can expand up to <code>75%</code> of the view size, while the other remaining <code>25%</code> stays reserved for the preview area. </p>

<p>I would say it is already good size as default. If someone likes it to be bigger than <code>75%</code>, should be simple enough for them to increase. If someone likes it smaller more like <code>50% - 50%</code>, is also should be simple enough for them to decrease it.</p>

<p>I just cannot think anyone can adequately work with the text editor size with the size of <code>25%</code> of the screen as it currently is, when the question text is bigger. Because you can barely see where you are on the text, and what are the other things you have. And as the preview area is fixed to only show you the top of the question, it does not make much sense to have a preview area showing up on <code>75%</code> of the screen, while you are probably working on something out at the middle/end of the question text with a text editor with <code>25%</code> of view size.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Moderators, who are either elected or appointed, I believe just 'moderate'.</li>
<li>I assume if the Best Answer is a discussion in Meta - someone ultimately decides, or the decision is simply based on a set of predefined criteria that is used. For example, the original Web designer (Jin?) had input from the ""customer"" - the three founding sites, but now in this case, it is one of ~ 170 sites, each with, I assume, differing goals.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow I believe is designed for programmers, and would naturally have different goals than Life/ Arts sites, or Mathematica, for example. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the question of change is raised locally on a Site, there is likely a better chance the Answers will be more on target, than in a general discussion with Answers at the Meta level, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Bottom-up decisions typically work better than Top-down ones, especially when Consensus is used in the decision-making process.  </p>

I engage in discussions where the discussions take place for long time (not long as per MSE, SO standard but according to beta site standard) like 10 minutes regarding some policy. There may be an exchange of some 10 messages from each side. When this happens between a moderator and me, the other users do not participate and play some jokes that I am talking too much. I am entitled to clear the assumptions and claims made on me. So I reply. Moderators make assertions that I am blaming them every time and bunks the topic without answering the queries. Some or the other way, it gets portrayed that there is a fight between mods and me. Some play <s> lame </s> jokes that I am doing to achieve something. Some even think I criticize for each and every action which is not true. I tried to say that it is not a fight and a query and a discussion. </p>

<p>How do I let the users know that such discussions between  a moderator and user for clarifications and policies are okay and common on Stack Exchange network and this is not a personal fight or hate towards them?</p>

<p><sup> I am sure this happens on other sites too. I am linking to some chat conversation. This is an experience I have multiple times and tried clarifying that I am not fighting. I am looking for a general answer. </sup></p>

"321241","Allow moderators to fine-tune the effects of a lock","<h3>Current Situation</h3>

<p>When a moderator locks a question or answer, they can choose between different types of post notices: <em>content dispute, off-topic comments, historical significance, wiki answer,</em> or no notice.
<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/260425/255554"">The notice in turn affects the effect of the lock</a>, but that it works this way is not clear to moderators and it is also not clear what effect a given notice has.
The only way to find out for sure is to ask somebody who is not a moderator or use a sock.
(This is due to moderator powers possibly overriding the effect of locks.)</p>

<h3>Feature Request</h3>

<p>Store the effects of a lock separately independent of the post notice.
In the interface for locking a post, provide moderators with a checklist regarding the effects of the lock, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This lock prevents:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>answers</li>
  <li>votes</li>
  <li>flags</li>
  <li>comments</li>
  <li>edits</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For questions, also add an option to apply the same lock to all answers to the question.
For the canned lock reasons, automatically provide an appropriate choice as defaults.</p>

<p>At the very least make it clear in the dialogue what detailed effects a lock has.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Post locks are used rarely, but when they are it is often for important reasons such as avoiding a divide of the community, an escalation of events, or similar.
Thus, locks are a tool which moderators have little experience with, but whose correct use (i.e., choosing the right type of effects and knowing what the effects are) may be crucial.
Moreover, many locks are used for special cases with individual needs, which in turn require individual locks.</p>

<p>In a specific example, there is a question on Academia, which lead answers and comments, whose appropriateness for the site is subject to a Meta discussion.
To avoid further potentially inappropriate comments, answers, etc., I wished to lock question for the remainder of the Meta discussion.
I chose <em>content dispute</em> as a lock reason, since it seemed most appropriate notice, however this only prevented edits to the question – which makes sense in other cases but not here.
After I noticed this, I chose a historical lock (which I knew to be affecting everything) and removed the post notice (because it was not appropriate).
The latter action lead to comments on answers being allowed (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/260425/255554"">because that’s what a lock without notice does for whatever reason</a>), which was not the desired effect either.</p>

I have answered the question providing all the necessary information and a piece of working code to illustrate the results. However there is another answer providing the same logic with mine but it isn't quite correct and produces wrong results moreover if someone else read it they will get the wrong impression about a well documented function.</p>

<p>In particular the line of code</p>

<pre><code>index = generator.Next(0, List.length - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Is wrong because according to the documentation <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.next?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Random_Next_System_Int32_System_Int32_"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> the second parameter is exclusive which means that the second parameter will never be returned by the function instead the parameter - 1 will be returned. So in that example, as a result, the last number of the array will never be returned. The correct code should be:</p>

<pre><code>index = generator.Next(0, List.length)
</code></pre>

<p>This causes two errors. First the code doesn't produce the desired OP's results and second, as I said above, if someone reads it they will get the wrong impression about how the function works.</p>

<p>Of course I did comment in the wrong answer providing details about what's wrong.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, because of the above reasons I feel that I need to down vote the answer, however I have answered the question as well and I don't want to get misunderstood that I am down voting because of competitive reasons or something like that.</p>

"322965","Move the question/answer ban meta to per-site help","<p>This relates to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/306329/152515"">People get lost and crash into meta - maybe we need roadblocks for their safety</a> and the issue it's dealing with: people ask off-topic questions on here all the time. I think it's common knowledge that a non-negligible portion have certainly been question banned elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition to setting up roadblocks, I think something else that would help is simply not sending people here so soon to begin with.</p>

<p>Let's consider the process a relatively new question-banned user goes through:</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone understands how their Stack operates extremely poorly and eventually gets question banned.</li>
<li>The first thing they see is a message directing them to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/86997/152515"">What can I do when getting &quot;We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account&quot;?</a></li>
<li>Once clicking that link they realise they're on, wow, a brand new Q&amp;A site! An active one with lots of people! With a big ol' Ask Question button in the top right!</li>
<li>They can't use that other Q&amp;A site so hey, maybe they can ask their question here!</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the user understands our Q&amp;A network poorly enough they got question banned in the first place it's also very unlikely they'd recognise step 4 is a bad idea, or they want to do it anyway because they have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>My suggestion: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/86997/152515"">What can I do when getting &quot;We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account&quot;?</a> should not be a meta post, but instead a page on the per-site help center users are directed to. This reduces the likelihood they'll wind up here, instead of the current approach which puts them on a downhill slope to wind up here almost immediately.</p>

<p>This won't stop <em>all</em> the off-topic questions we get but it may at least reduce the quantity and frequency.</p>

Making a question community wiki automatically transforms all of its answers to community wiki also. Thus, I remove those answers from the analysis (for the answer figure) whose parent questions are also community wiki. Interestingly, I find sharp drops in questions after July 2010 and after March 2014. After some investigation, I find that in April 2014, all automatic triggers for community wiki were stopped. While this explains the drop-2 in wiki questions but I could not find any reason for drop-1. Similarly, I also observe some interesting cases for wiki answers (see drop-1, drop-2 and a sudden increase in wiki answers). Can anyone shed light (possible explanation) on these cases?  </p>

"323047","Lack of new contributor indicator outs review audits","<p>Occasionally, when I get a known-good audit in the review queue, the system shows me a fake usercard of a new user to not make it obvious that it is an audit; as it was actually posted by a higher-rep user, it lacks the ""new contributor"" indicator. Also, a spam or non-answer will usually have an indicator, but on known-bad audits, it lacks the indicator since it was actually posted more than a week ago.</p>

<p>In both cases, the lack of a ""new contributor"" indicator can immediately give away the fact that a review is an audit. In most cases, one has to do additional investigation to see if something's an audit, but since SE decided to show the fake usercards in the first place, I think this is sufficiently obvious enough that a user can determine if something's a review audit by simply checking for the non-presence of the indicator.</p>

<p>Is this a problem, and if so, what can be done about this? Should we show an artificial indicator whenever the system generates a review audit and uses a fake usercard?</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Phase 3 of this project is to add more utility to these saved lists, adding them to the main left navigation and adding indicators for new content.</p>

<p>We've already made significant progress on this front, our production Tag Server is already set up to send back content notifications and I have a version of the web app running locally.

"323513","Reduce horizontal scrolling in code examples","<p>Horizontal scrolling is annoying.<br>
In rather narrow viewports it tends to appear frequently.<br>
The usability issue is that it breaks ""flow"" mind state.<br>
I eliminated it (almost totally) with a simple TamperMonkey script that widens JS <code>pre</code> tags when the cursor pointer hovers them.<br>
If you want to try it, here is the code:  </p>

<pre><code>// ==UserScript==
// @name         Enlarge StackOverflow code examples on hover
// @namespace    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/*
// @version      0.1
// @description  Depending on the viewport width, StackOverflow code examples might
//               require a lot of annoying horizontal scroll, and eventually vertical
//               scroll too.
//               This script enlarges the code boxes ""&lt;pre&gt;"" when the mouse pointer
//               hovers them.
// @include      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/*
// @author       Juan Lanus
// @grant        GM_addStyle
// @grant        unsafeWindow

    width:880px;
    max-height:unset;
    position:relative;
    z-index:99;
}`);
/******************************************************************************************************************/
</code></pre>

<p>When the code sample is hovered, the CSS rule widens the code box and brings it to front.<br>
It also eliminates the max-height so the code wont have a vertical scrollbar. </p>

I was a bit curious whether having the question prominently displayed influences how high the question will appear in Google searches (and in other search engines).</p>

<p>Since this adds a link to the question to a new page (which is probably high ranked), my guess would be that there might be at least minor effect.</p>

<p><strong>Question.</strong> Is it possible to find out in some way whether a bounty actually influences ranking of the post in search engines?</p>

<p><em>Motivation for asking about this.</em> People use bounties for various purposes. Probably the most typical uses are to attract attention to a question which hasn't received satisfactory answer or to reward a nice answer. Some people use bounties as a way to attract more attention to what they consider the best content of the site (be it good questions or good answers) - this happens probably more often on big sites where interesting stuff might get easily drowned by a lot of basic question which are posted on the site every day. I suppose that it might be useful for user offering bounties to know whether they also have this positive side effect (especially when using bounties to promote good content).</p>

<p>The problem of this limitation for having only a single draft available is that users can see their drafts being lost because the system automatically overwrites them without confirmation (at least this happened to me, where I saved and left a question, and in the meantime continued answering other questions).</p>

<p>This is very unintuitive. You would not expect a draft to be overwritten (ie being lost) without consent.</p>

<p>Overwriting an old draft should at least be warned for before the draft is allowed to be overwritten, and ideally it should be possible to turn of the system that automatically saves the drafts such that you can not get an unexpected overwritten draft.</p>

"323953","Moderators should be able to undelete comments that were deleted by a single flag","<p>Moderators can undelete comments that have been deleted.  This is useful; it allows us to purge a big pile of comments and then undelete the two that added value.  It also lets us undo accidents (hello, moderating on a phone :-) ).</p>

<p>There is one exception to this: if the author of a comment deleted it, mods can't undelete.  That makes sense; we allow people to take back their words without risk of having them come back later.</p>

<p>I've just bumped into a second exception: I came across a comment that was deleted by a single flag, because the comment contained a magic keyword.  The comment also contained useful information, so I tried to undelete it -- and couldn't.</p>

<p>The author of the comment wanted it there (this wasn't a retraction).  A moderator wanted it there.  But a user who is neither was able to prevent me from recovering the comment.</p>

<p>The regular expression behind this expedited flag-deletion is not perfect.  It can't be; it's only a regex.  Sometimes human judgement is needed.  Not all uses of ""accept"" are bad, and not all occurrences of ""+1"" mean there's not also something valuable in the comment.</p>

<p>Some users are actively hunting for these comments and flagging them.  They're using scripts, not their own judgement, but even if they were looking at individual comments, they sometimes make mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, there is a flag on an answer which is weakly substantiated. I handle the issue and leave a required comment. In order to remember to check if the answer was edited and hence upgraded, I do not mark the flag as useful and leave it over for some time. But my colleague can easily look through the flag, see that I left a comment and 'close the ticket'. (Then how am I supposed to find the post then? Per aspera ad astra?) This could be avoided if there was a place near the flag where moderators could leave brief notes, e.g. 'Need to check if the proofs are added; don't put it away.'</p>

<p>This is just one of the possible appliances. </p>

<p>One can say: you can have a special chat on moderation, don't clutter up the interface! But the thing is that, for example, we on Русский язык do not have a chat and my colleague does not want to use it. Moreover, if there are a lot of cases like the aforementioned, how to remember them all?

"324390","Use back button to show site list on Android","<p>As phones keep getting bigger reaching the edge of the phone keeps getting harder.</p>

<p>While browsing/reading questions on a phone (yes, typically I'm a lurker) it is hard to open sites list. Suppose I'm holding the phone in my right hand - there are two ways I can achieve this:</p>

<ul>
<li>By shifting the phone in my right hand</li>
<li>By using my left hand (which may be busy)</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to solve this usability issue would be to allow the back button on the main screen to, instead of immediately closing the application, open the sites list and only if it is opened close the app. A good example of this behavior is the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Feedly mobile app</a>.</p>

<p>Point to consider is whether this will impact users who actually use the back button to close apps.</p>

"324433","Area 51 accounts can't be deleted by the user, but the system prevents users from using the contact form","<p>If a user wants to delete their Area 51 account, it's not possible to do so through the normal settings. The <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5999/how-can-i-delete-my-account"">account deletion FAQ</a> says to contact SE if one wants their Area 51 account deleted.</p>

<p>When I click the ""contact us"" link at the bottom of the Area 51 homepage, I get directed to <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/contact"">https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/contact</a>, i.e. the Area 51 Discussions contact form. Area 51 Discussions is based off the ""modern"" SE code base.</p>

<p>From there, if one tries to choose the option ""I need to delete my user profile"", the system shows a dialog box with an option to click ""Continue"" or close the box. If I close the box, the dropdown option is cleared. This is intended behavior on normal SE sites where one can delete their own account, but on Area 51 it doesn't make sense since one can't delete their own account.</p>

<p>Additionally, if one clicks the ""Continue"" button, they are then redirected to <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/users/delete/current"">https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/users/delete/current</a>, which leads to a 404 error.</p>

<p>This creates a <strong>very confusing</strong> scenario for one who wants to delete their Area 51 account: they can't do so through the normal account settings, then the FAQ says to contact SE, then the contact form doesn't allow one to choose the option for deletion and directs them to a non-existent page instead.</p>

<p>The solutions here would be to remove the restriction against choosing the ""I need to delete my user profile"" option on the Area 51 Discussions contact form, or to make the Continue button not direct the user anywhere, but just close the box and leave the option set.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55013954/how-to-apply-a-gabor-filter-to-an-image-with-hexagonal-sampling"">helping someone</a> and although I could unit test my small piece, I could not end-to-end test the solution because I was missing some of their precursor code.

It occurred to me that since that bit of information is useful to me, and is useful to them, and seems a priori to possibly be useful to others, then as an answer to an implied question in the comment thread, namely ""how to transform a square-pixel image into a hex-pixel image?"", that such a question might deserve to be asked.

<p>I think there should be a tag for the First Posts review queue, given that its mechanics are different from most other review queues (e.g. able to access with only 500 rep, a single review dismisses the task, can take any action or no action, etc.) and because we have a tag for the <a href=""/questions/tagged/late-answers"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;late-answers&#39;"" rel=""tag"">late-answers</a> queue, which has similar mechanics.</p>

<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/207541/how-is-accio-a-safe-spell"">A question</a> was closed as off-topic. I voted to reopen it and it was eventually reopened. However, in the process of getting reopened the question was edited. I closed the edited question as a duplicate of a different question, and another user reopened it (both of us have gold tag badges). The question was then rolled back several times, until it was back in the form that had been closed as off-topic. </p>

<p>At this point someone voted to close it again as off-topic, and here's where it gets interesting. Normally, once you vote to close a question and it gets closed, or you vote to reopen a question and it gets reopened, you can no longer cast that same vote. Since I had already voted to close this question (as a duplicate) I no longer had the ability to cast a vote to close it as off-topic. However, I was also prevented from voting to leave it open as not off-topic. </p>

<p>Why am I unable to vote to leave this question open? I can think of two possible reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I already voted to close it and it was closed.</li>
<li>I already voted to reopen it and it was reopened.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yet neither of these reasons seem so logical. I voted to close the question for a different reason, so why should I not be able to vote that the <em>current</em> reason does not apply? (I suppose this could be tested by finding a case where someone voted to close and the question was closed and then it was reopened by <em>other</em> users and then sent to the Close Queue for a different reason.) If I can even vote to actually reopen a question that I have participated in closing, I should <em>a fortiori</em> be able to merely vote to leave open a question I participated in closing. </p>

<p>And if it's because I reopened the question, why should I lose my leave open vote? In general, when you are involved in closing or reopening a question you can still vote to leave the question the way it is if it comes up in the queue again. So the fact that my reopen vote succeeded should not be a reason for me to lose my leave open vote.</p>

<p>And if neither one of the above factors is a good reason for me to lose my leave open vote then the combination of them should also not remove my ability to vote.</p>

"326766","Why does adding a duplicate bump a question if marking it as a duplicate in the first place doesn't?","<p>I recently added questions to the list of duplicates on a couple of closed questions. To my surprise I then found those questions at the top of the homepage. This was surprising to me because closing questions (as duplicates or for any other reason) does <em>not</em> bump them. After poking around a bit I found a couple of questions here that document that indeed the system is designed to not bump questions for being closed but to yes bump questions for having questions added to the duplicate list:</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48578/what-can-cause-a-question-to-be-bumped"">What can cause a question to be bumped?</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303202/closing-question-causes-a-bump"">Closing question causes a bump?</a></p>

<p>This seems rather puzzling. As far as I understand, the point of having modifications bump a question is so that the modifications can be reviewed. Actually closing a question seems to be a much more significant modification than merely adding an additional question to the duplicate list. As such I would expect there to be more of a reason for a question to be bumped when it gets closed than for for it to get bumped when the duplicate list is modified. Yet the opposite is apparently true.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I don't like it when others do this, because it not only makes the chat one-sided and thus difficult to follow for other users, but it also violates the spirit of a suspension: they should not be able to get around the spirit of it by ""chatting"" via their chat bio with users who are willing to engage with them. In some cases, it can even smother existing topics and chats.</p>

<p>I'm aware that there exists a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/250161/extend-profile-hiding-in-chat-for-suspended-users"">stalled feature request</a> to increase the force of a chat suspension, to prevent suspended users from being able to join rooms or edit their chat profile descriptions, and it could take a while for that to be implemented since resources seem to have been diverted away from chat development.</p>

<p>That said, given the <em>current</em> state of the chat moderation tools, what can moderators do against such users? The only actions one can take directly against the user are to clear out their chat profile description or delete their chat profile, but the user can quickly recreate those.</p>

<p>After some consideration, I think the correct solution might be to not directly go against the user, but against the other users who attempt to engage with the suspended user. A moderator could ask others to mark the user as ""ignored"" (which would also disable the entry animation for that user, for that user) and not to engage with them, and kick chat users who do attempt to engage with the suspended user. The hope there would be that the suspended user would realize that their efforts are futile and move on. But what if said user seems to have the time and energy to keep doing what they're doing? I only believe that to be a short-term solution, as it requires moderators to persistently be on patrol, and the entry animation cannot be disabled globally (only by each user).</p>

"327383","Deleted posts could create confusion for colour blind users; is there something to be done about it?","<p>I'm a mod on <a href=""https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/"">Game Development</a> and today, in chat, a user has asked me to delete something they mistakenly posted as an answer instead of a comment. And so I went ahead and deleted the answer.</p>

<p>But then keeping chatting with them, I realized that they thought that deleting the post themselves would have it go into a queue of some sort until it was ""deleted for real"" since they still saw the post; they thought that asking a mod to do it instead would ""delete it right away"". Their confusion seemed to come from the fact that the red background of the deleted post, and red text saying it's deleted did not appear red enough for them, as they were color blind. </p>

<p>Here is an example of what a deleted post looks like on our site:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/JzfZn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JzfZn.png"" alt=""deleted post example""></a></p>

<p>And running this example through a ""<a href=""https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter?orig_uri=https://i.sstatic.net/JzfZn.png&amp;process_type=protan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">colour blind filter</a>"" gives something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ft7Dr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ft7Dr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The rendered output is not the greatest thing ever, but we still can see that the red text is not really red, and depending on the monitor and the surrounding lighting conditions, the now ""greyer"" background could be harder to distinguish.</p>

<p>I don't know much about colour blindness, but I'm wondering if there is something to be done about this. This is one occurrence of this issue, and I don't know how widespread it is otherwise. </p>

Then I realized I posted it on the wrong SE network site (I had initially written it for AskUbuntu, but realized it fit better on ServerFault), so I went and deleted it after a few minutes, so I could post it on ServerFault, so I would have to wait before I could post it. I came back this morning, and after all this, the website said I looked like a robot, which is honestly understandable, given my behavior, but I really do need an answer to my question.</p>

<p>The problem is, I can't check the nonexistent box. Other people with the same issue had solved it by going on incognito mode, which didn't work for me. Eventually I figured out that SE is maybe probably using Google CAPTCHA, which just doesn't work in China where I am. I fired up my VPN, but still failed to connect.

Our site, which is supposed to act as the central clearinghouse for network-wide matters, doesn't have a great rep despite the good efforts of many people here.  Using a system designed for objective(ish) Q&amp;A, ""no chit-chat"", for <em>discussions</em> about functionality, policy, seasonal fun, and strongly-held beliefs probably isn't helping.</p>

<p><strong>Does it have to be this way?</strong>  Meta.SE is already different in some ways from <em>both</em> the per-site metas <em>and</em> all the other main sites.  Are there other things we should look at tuning?  Can we reduce the bad experiences while maintaining the quality that keeps everyone here and ready to help?</p>

<p>I've seen some things here that make me a little sad inside, cases where it <em>feels</em> like frustration could have been avoided with better...something.  Things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support requests getting downvoted to oblivion, so they drop off the front page and don't get answered.</li>
<li>New users deleting their accounts after asking an unpopular (but not poorly-asked) question.</li>
<li>Questions that raise a reasonable point for discussion but don't follow some of our unwritten rules, so feedback focuses on language, formatting, and other flaws, instead of edits or constructive comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I'm deliberately not linking to examples.  I'm not going to draw even more attention to specific Meta trainwrecks.  If you've read this far, you've probably seen them.  If not, it probably won't be long before you see another one.)</p>

<p>I don't think these things happen because Meta is full of people who enjoy pulling others down.  <strong>We've got a lot of great people here</strong>, people who tirelessly answer support requests and help figure out bugs and bring new ideas to discussions and patiently explain, <em>again</em>, why that thing the question asked about happens.  I've been here a while and I've seen a lot of people helping people.  And yet, we also have the less-positive things I've mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>This makes me think there's something systemic that's contributing</strong>, something that works against good people trying to do good things.</p>

<p>This is a broad discussion, I know, but I think it's time we talk about what we could do to make Meta work better for its unique-on-the-network goals, <em>without</em> endangering the things that work well.  Because many things <em>do</em> work well; Meta may mean murder sometimes, but it also means people working together to make our sites and the software that runs them better.  Can we be less murderous without being less effective?  What would we need to change?</p>

<p>As no <code>itemtype</code> is specified for the item (that gets created with <code>itemscope</code>), no <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-microdata-20180426/#dfn-vocabulary-identifier"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>vocabulary identifier</em></a> is prepended to the properties (<code>name</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>upvoteCount</code> etc.).  This means that <strong>these properties aren’t Schema.org properties</strong> (except for the <code>name</code> that belongs to the <code>Person</code>, as there the Schema.org type is specified).</p>

<p>That’s why the SDTT says ""Unspecified Type"", and that’s why it prepends the document’s base URL (<code>https://stackoverflow.com/</code>) to the properties.</p>

<h2>Recommended fix</h2>

<p>It should be fine to use <a href=""https://schema.org/QAPage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>QAPage</code></a> and <a href=""https://schema.org/Question"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Question</code></a> if no <a href=""https://schema.org/Answer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Answer</code></a> is posted yet. It’s also fine for Google’s <a href=""https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/qapage?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Q&amp;A Page rich result</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>Question</code> type defines the question that this page answers, and includes the answers, <strong>if any</strong>, to that question.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><code>answerCount</code> - Integer - The total number of answers to the question. For example, if there are 15 answers, but only the first 10 are marked up due to pagination, this value would be 15. <strong>This may also be 0 for questions with no answers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>For questions without answers, set the <code>answerCount</code> property to 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the most straightforward fix would be to use the same structured data (that gets used for a question with answer) for a question without answer. The only difference would be to omit the <code>suggestedAnswer</code>/<code>acceptedAnswer</code> properties. </p>

<p>(currently, <code>answerCount: 0</code> is already provided for a question without answer, as the screenshot above shows)</p>

<h2>Alternative fix</h2>

<p>If, for some reason, <code>QAPage</code> shouldn’t be used, you could </p>



<ul>
<li><p>either use its parent type <a href=""https://schema.org/WebPage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>WebPage</code></a> instead of <code>QAPage</code> (and everything else stays the same):</p>

"328591","Can we add ""Be Honest"" back into the Code of Conduct?","<h2>Background &amp; Motivation</h2>

<p>After reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/08/07/get-to-know-our-new-code-of-conduct/"">this blog post</a> about the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"">Code of Conduct</a>, I have a suggestion to add <strong>""Be Honest""</strong> back into the Code of Conduct.  Yes, I realize the blog post is nearly a year old, but this issue is still relevant because the Code of Conduct is still in effect currently.  The blog post claims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since its inception in mid-2008, Stack Overflow and our subsequent network of Stack Exchange sites managed to flourish under a <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080916123307/http://stackoverflow.com:80/faq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">single guiding principle</a> that everyone was expected to follow:</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>.. Be nice.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Stack Overflow and subsequent Exchange sites <strong><em>did not</em></strong> ""flourish under a single guiding principle"", but rather under <strong><em>two</em> guiding principles</strong>.  Even the link in the post for <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080916123307/http://stackoverflow.com:80/faq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">single guiding principle</a> shows the second principle, which is ""Be Honest"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Be honest.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Above all, be honest. If you see misinformation, vote it
  down. Insert comments indicating what, specifically, is wrong. Even
  better — edit and improve the information! Provide stronger, faster,
  superior answers of your own!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So, why was ""Be Honest"" left out of the Code of Conduct?  Can we add it back in?</h2>

<p>After searching the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help"">Help Center</a> for <code>be honest</code>, I discovered that the <em>very similar text</em> is still present in the list of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/behavior"">Expected Behavior</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be honest.</p>
  
  <p>Above all, be honest. If you see misinformation, vote it down. Add
  comments indicating what, specifically, is wrong. Provide better
  answers of your own. Last but not least, edit and improve the existing
  questions and answers! By doing these things, you are helping keep
  Stack Exchange a great place to share knowledge of our craft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could argue that since it is already present in the Expected Behavior, there is no need to repeat ""Be Honest"" in the Code of Conduct, but I disagree.  The idea ""Be nice"" is essentially expounded on in the Code of Conduct via the discussion of kindness (though perhaps kindness is a genuine upgrade from ""niceness"").  I support the idea of ""Be Honest"" being expounded on in the Code of Conduct as well, or just being outright added.</p>

<p>After all, isn't honesty central to our community?  Isn't the truth central to the quest for knowledge, wisdom, and understanding?  If so, then perhaps it should take a central role in shaping our conduct and community.</p>

"328602","Answer disappeared without any clue about the reason","<p>Yesterday, I came to a question in StackOverflow about how to sort a data array with different fields and render into an html table using JavaScript.</p>

<p>I provided an answer posting a function and some links (a working example, and some references where the author could find more extra information or alternatives). After a while, I received a comment from the author in my answer saying something like ""works great, thank you"". I was then expecting my answer to be accepted by the author, but instead a couple of minutes later I found the question to have been deleted (and thus my answer too) without any further comment, reason or notice provided.</p>

<p>I would like to share some thoughts about this fact.</p>

<ul>
<li>How am I supposed to know that an author actually deleted his question, if my reputation is lower than 10k (and probably always will be) and not something else has happened?</li>
<li>Was something wrong regarding my answer, that was related? And even if there was, I would expect the answer to be maybe downvoted.</li>
<li>Shouldn't the system notify users when an answer of them is deleted?</li>
<li>I found the overall situation a bit annoying and showing not much respect to the people who put some effort (maybe little, maybe more) to deal with somebody's question. To just leave without providing any justification or clue (maybe just a comment).</li>

<p>However, I noticed that I stopped receiving e-mail notifications for inbox messages, including chat pings, comments and comment pings.</p>

The principle of least surprise would seem to me to suggest that at least, when deleting a login with the e-mail address associated with notifications, the user should be told that they also need to update the e-mail address under <em>Edit Email Settings</em> as presumably they intend to change the address associated with their account.</p>

  <p>This question <strong>does not appear to seek input and discussion</strong> from the community. If you have encountered a problem on one of our sites, please describe it in detail. See also: <a href=""/help/whats-meta"">What is ""meta""? How does it work?</a></p>

"328990","Can't copy results in SEDE","<p>Copying the output from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer is pretty broken.</p>

<p>I stole a <a href=""https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/814724/sort-stability-test"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">query here</a> that outputs numbers from 1-100 to demonstrate the issue. Here's a GIF of me selecting everything, copying (at the very bottom of the list), then going back to unselect some stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Lu1ow.gif"" alt=""""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, it doesn't unselect things properly after you've scrolled. And—more importantly—here is what was copied (unformatted to save space):</p>

<p><code>81Odd82Even83Odd84Even85Odd86Even87Odd88Even89Odd90Even91Odd92Even93Odd94Even95Odd96Even97Odd98Even99Odd100Even</code></p>

<p>It's clear that only lines 81-100 were selected: 20 lines total. The developer console tells the rest of the story: object permanence isn't real; nothing besides these 20 lines actually exists on the page. As you scroll, the lines are added and removed from the page.</p>

<p>I highly encourage you to try this out yourself.</p>

<p>This behavior makes no sense and makes for terrible user experience. How would you expect the average person (i.e. someone with no SQL experience) to deal with this? And think of what happens when you have 25 lines and you copy them: would you notice that there are some lines missing?</p>

<p>There is a workaround (make the URL in the query and get plain text results), but is not as easy as using <code>[Post Link]</code>. I'd really like to be able to use <code>[Post Link]</code> because it's easy-to-use, cross-site, and gives me a hyperlinked title (which can then be easily converted to Markdown). </p>

<p>Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange have their own chat servers, that are apart from the ""general"" chat server that handles all other sites.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58587/reputation-requirements-compared"">privilege FAQ</a> wasn't clear about this. Also, from what I can tell, my Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange reputation <em>are</em> counting toward my <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/users/78973/gparyani"">general chat reputation</a> (it equals the sum of all my accounts where I have at least 200 reputation, including SO and MSE, taking into account caching). I also remember the moment when that sum total crossed 10,000, and at that moment I was granted the ability to see chat flags. But since the algorithm for calculating Chat.SE reputation changes once a user has the network association bonus rights, it might work differently when a user does not.</p>

"329580","Raise an autoflag if somebody deletes a post that was previously undeleted by a moderator","<h3>Proposal</h3>

<p>Raise an automatic flag if a post that was undeleted by a moderator gets deleted by anybody other than a moderator.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>If a moderator undeletes a post, this usually overrides a deletion made by the author, the community, or the Roomba bot.
In either situation, deleting the post at a later date would probably be undesired behaviour and should therefore raise an alert.</p>

<p>A typical situation is this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A user goes on a self-vandalising spree deleting questions and answers without clear reason (so no honest clean-up).</p></li>
<li><p>A moderator suspends the user and undoes the deletions.</p></li>
<li><p>The user does not delete their account (as such users often do).</p></li>
<li><p>The suspension expires.</p></li>
<li><p>The user deletes the posts again.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sure, there are exceptions when the deletion is fine, but then the moderators can just not act on it.
However, I would expect the false-positive rate of such a flag to be very low.</p>

<p>Note that the system completely prevents the opposite case: A post deleted by a moderator cannot be undeleted by anybody except another moderator.</p>

<p><strong>Why wouldn't we want to allow the more specific question, to help people who might be looking for the same thing?</strong> Isn't that better than forcing them to hunt through long answers for the detail they need?</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Question A asks about something complicated (like, ""Who is Voldemort?""), and gets an answer that answers the question comprehensively, with lots of detail on related topics.</p></li>
<li><p>Question B asks a more specific question about one aspect of the complicated topic (like, ""Where was Voldemort born?"").</p></li>
<li><p>Then, Question B gets closed a duplicate of Question A.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There's no doubt that the accepted answer for Question A includes the correct answer for Question B. But it's hidden inside a long answer, most of which is entirely unrelated to Question B.</p>

"329877","What changes have resulted from SE network sites becoming a source of income?","<p>Nearly three years ago, display ads stopped being an SO-only thing and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/287242/222389"">came to some other relevant sites</a>. More recently, this programme widened to include <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/306737/222389"">affiliate ads on most sites</a>. Both times, one of the arguments put forward for why this was good for the health of the community was that it turned the network sites outside the ""big three"" from cost centres to profit centres. Because the health of these sites would now be directly linked to SE's income, this would give SE more incentive to build and support those communities.</p>

<p>Since then, SE the company has seen serious changes. A lot of people responsible for helping out communities, and some responsible for selling ads in the first place, have lost their jobs, leaving a smaller, more stretched team. In this period there's also been bad feeling amongst the moderators of sites that aren't SO, a sense that the company is more responsive to random people complaining on Twitter than to its own moderators (and maybe even the community managers in its own staff). (Hot network questions and the Code of Conduct being two such issues.)</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, it's not entirely surprising that <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/329763/222389"">the new expansion in ads</a> is going to be done in a way that gives SE less input and control - because at this scale they simply don't have the people power to curate relevant and helpful ads that visitors want to see. I think we all understand that it's getting increasingly hard to keep the lights on in SE HQ, and that the smaller sites too have to earn their keep: but do we even have the resources to make that happen?</p>

<p>My question is, how has SE tried to make network sites more valuable since November 2016, as a result of those sites' increasing contribution to the company finances? What resources has SE made available to support those bringing traffic to those sites and building those communities?</p>

I remembered three words in the title: 'writing' and 'clamours', the latter since I rarely encounter it. So I <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=writing+clamours"">search for <code>writing clamours</code></a> and am perplexed to be staring at zero search results. Did the spelling change from <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clamour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">British to American English</a>? Nope, it turns out the Stack Exchange search engine treats 'Writing.SE' as one word; <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=writing.se+clamours"">searching for <code>writing.se clamours</code></a> does yield the question I'm looking for.</p>

<p>I know the Stack Exchange search engine isn't meant to replace Google, with all its capabilities to correct spelling errors etc., but this should be rather easy to fix. The <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tokenizer settings</a> should be adjusted to split on dots/periods as well, just like they do right now on e.g. single quotes, as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=travel.se+-%22Travel.se%22"">this search example shows</a>.</p>

<p>There's one other place where flags congregate.  As with the dashboard, it's only visible to moderators.  Unlike the mod dashboard (on my sites), it often has more than a few entries.  I'm talking about the list of flags raised against a user.  Could we have a summary there too?  There's room and it'd really help for certain types of issues.  I mean something like this:</p>

<p>I grouped flagged comments together at the bottom because we have a page for that already, so you could just link to it.  If the flags were helpful those comments aren't going to be on this page anyway.  (Also, these numbers are made-up, in case anyone's wondering.)</p>

<p>Right now we see a total number of flags on user pages, but not all flags reflect poorly on the user.  Some are declined, some are auto-flags caused by other users' behavior,<sup>1</sup> some are self-flags (e.g. ""I edited; could this be undeleted now?""), and some are neutral.  I'd like to be better able to understand the whole picture.</p>

<p>We <em>do</em> have a list of the most <em>recent</em> flags, nicely presented.  That's a big help!  I'm asking for this table of contents <em>too</em>, because sometimes we need to review more of the history.  I hope that you've already done most of the work of design and implementation for other reasons and this addition would not require a huge effort.</p>

<h2>Bug #2</h2>

<p>The second is about the ""add a comment"" link. It actually displays to anonymous users if the post has been commented on. The link is clickable, but nothing happens when clicking on it in mobile view; it just adds <code>#tap-top</code> to the address bar's URL.</p>

<p>The bug #1 may be solved by including the ""add a comment"" at the bottom of every post (question or answer), whether it has been commented on or not.</p>

<p>I think the bug #2 may be solved by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>redirecting to the login page on click</li>
<li>displaying a tooltip which invites the anonymous user to log in. This is the preferred solution because it is consistent with the vote button behavior.</li>

"330784","Do deleted or closed posts interfere with an account merge?","<p>A new, unregistered user showed up a few days ago on another Stack Exchange site. That user posted a question, and then, about an hour later, a separate, <em>registered</em> account posted a non-answer ""answer"" to the question providing what appeared to be additional information that should have gone into the question. I flagged the non-answer as Not An Answer (NAA). That answer was later deleted, and the question ended up being closed as a duplicate.</p>

<p>Suspecting that the second (registered) user was operated by the same person who created the first (unregistered) user, I flagged the original question for moderator attention for a possible account merge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect that this unregistered user is the same person as [user profile link redacted] , who recently posted an NAA answer to this question which appears to give additional details for the question. Could you investigate this for possible merging? – Robert Columbia Jul 8 at 23:25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My flag was declined with the following message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>declined - In order to do anything I would have to re-open the question and undelete the answer, which I think is more than I should do with the two different names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am <em>not</em> disputing whether this flag should have been declined or whether an account merge would or would not have been appropriate (I have considered raising this on the appropriate per-site Meta but right now feel that a single such declined flag is too minor for such an action), but I wanted to ask about the truth of the custom message that the moderator left for me here, and to what extent this barrier actually exists for moderators.</p>

<p><em>Is it actually the case that closed questions and/or deleted answers prevent or interfere with an account merge?</em> More specifically, is there such a <em>technical</em> barrier (i.e. the merge will fail/error out/trigger missile launches/etc. if posts are not reopened and/or undeleted before the merge is triggered), or is merging an account that has not done anything but post low-quality content simply something that moderators <em>do not generally care to do</em>?</p>

<p>The page <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/edit-community-wiki"">Edit community wiki in the Help Center</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>community wiki posts show the editor with the highest percentage of the remaining post in the current version in the author field.</p>

<p>And the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/190209/217657"">accepted answer to What does the % in the Community Wiki box mean?</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not the last editor, it's the most prolific editor, based on a very naive calculation involving lines of the post that were changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I am called “the most prolific editor” because I edited <em>something</em> (although a little bit) in all paragraphs? Are the <em>changed lines</em> interpreted as lines of code, ending with the newline character (paragraphs in fact), and not the lines displayed in browser?</p>

<p>One more thing, the page says <code>2 users 56%</code>. Where are the remaining 44%? Only two users have been involved in the <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/169936/revisions"">post’s history</a>, so I’d expect their contribution to be 100%.</p>

However, 10k users can also <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-tools"">review reviews</a> and see the full history (the only difference is that they can't see other users' skipped items, and have no means to investigate a single user's review history).

<p>Well, as most people here on MSE know you can't actually find the link to the duplicate on this screenshot. That's because it's actually at the top of the question, which isn't visible anymore because I scrolled down.</p>

<p>Duplicates are probably one of the most important features of the entire Q&amp;A system. We want people to find them because the best answer is probably in the linked duplicate, and not on the closed question. <strong>Why do we hide the duplicate link so well if they're that important?</strong></p>

<p>The duplicate link should be far more visible. It should be present at the top of the question <strong>and</strong> below the close banner. It shouldn't be just a link, it should be a excerpt of the question like we show in question lists. It should be big and impossible to overlook, just short of making it a blinking marquee tag.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/UpUmi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UpUmi.png"" alt=""Screenshot of bounties tab""></a></p>

<p>However, this is not quite an accurate description. The number displayed there is actually the post's <em>score</em>, rather than the number of votes that the post has. In the above example, it says that there are 8 votes, but if we open the question we see that there are actually 10 upvotes and 2 downvotes for a total of 12 (not 8) votes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZHGKc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZHGKc.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of question score""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/APENI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/APENI.png"" alt=""Screenshot of questions tab""></a></p>

<p>Here the display tells us that the question has -2 votes. Aside from the fact that having a negative amount of votes is impossible, when we open this question we find that it actually has a whopping 20 votes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/1EnJK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1EnJK.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of question score""></a></p>

<p>The Answers tab has an additional twist. Here there is a hover text that explicitly states that the number displayed is the <em>total</em> number of votes on the answer:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/JhdmE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JhdmE.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of Answers tab""></a></p>

<p>Yet once again this is entirely inaccurate, as opening the answer shows that there are actually 32 total votes on this answer:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/9wzMi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/9wzMi.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot of answer score""></a></p>

<p>The simplest solution here would be to change the label, so that instead of saying that it is displaying the number of votes it will say that it is displaying the score.</p>

<p>Users were asked to answer six questions. Bellow one can see the questions with summary of the answers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>1. What problems do you personally experience when looking for answers to your programming questions in your first language on the Internet? What causes the most frustration? How would you improve this?</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Users think that the main problem is the absence of information in their first language. This was mentioned in almost all international communities. Users want to see more information in their first language in general, and particularly about new technologies.</p>

<p>Folks think that international developer communities can benefit a lot if more bilingual people start using international sites and help to bring the quality of the answers and depth of technical expertise on the sites to a new level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>2. Where do you find answers to programming questions today? What do you see as the main problem on these sites? How would you solve them?</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from international Stack Overflows, folks use various websites starting from personal blogs to Stack Overflow in English. Users mentioned that they do not like the number  of ads on sites, have difficulties with  navigation and it’s still tough to find the information people need since there is too much noise on most sites. Also people complained that on many websites it’s hard to keep the information relevant (users cannot edit others’ posts). </p>

<p>What struck me most is that folks said that the number of active forums in their first language has dramatically decreased over the last few years. This is bad news, especially in the context of the rise of sites with machine translated content from Stack Overflow in English. It seems the machine translated sites dominate even the source (Stack Overflow in English) in many languages. It scares me that we all might lose online communities in our first language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>3. On what do you spend the most time when looking for an answer? How would you improve this process?</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of users said that the most time consuming activity is to find the right keywords for search engines. Another common complaint was... about the search on Stack Overflow (the site).</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>4. What is the common problem that most developers who speak your language experience?</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>The most common problem among all languages is … asking questions. Users said that people who are new to programming do not know how to ask questions, on the other hand experts do not want to share what they know with the community. </p>

<p>Another problem which was mentioned a few times is lack of fundamental knowledge among our peers.</p>

<p>One response made me really sad. A user voiced that because of poverty, many of our colleagues do not have time and money for extra self education. </p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>5. What prevents the community from creating a free knowledge base in your language? How would you solve this problem?</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Users think that there are enough people who would like to come together and share knowledge with the community but they do not know about each other or the international sites. The suggested solution is to proactively look for such people and connect them on the platform. </p>

<p>Another problem that was mentioned is the negative feedback, especially in the case (as I understand it) when the community posts a lot of comments that say how bad the question is and at the same time the community does not provide any answers. Users think that it pushes people away. </p>

<p>Users also said that they would like to see more proactive enthusiastic fellows in the community: people who do not wait for others to write questions and answers for them, instead they share what they know with others or ask good questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>6.  Do you ask colleagues programming questions “offline”? What does this process look like? How would you improve this process?</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>The general response is that users do ask and answer questions offline and that is fine, nothing we can or should do about it. And that is great! =)</p>

<p>If you have anything that you would like to add, please feel free to post an answer here or on an international meta.</p>

<p>A lot of thanks to everyone who participated. Your feedback is very helpful. We appreciate it. We are not going to forget it. Instead,  together let us think about how to move forward fixing some of the issues that you have mentioned. </p>

"331625","SEDE query for posts flagged as NAA","<p>I am trying to figure out where in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2678/325443"">database schema</a> is stored the information about the kind of flag that has eventually been raised on a given answer.</p>

<p>It seems spam/offensive flags should generate some kind of entry in the <code>Votes</code> table with <code>VoteTypeId</code> 12 or 4. But it actually doesn't, for the posts I checked (as an example, see <a href=""https://data.stackexchange.com/electronics/query/1084160"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this query</a>, this was a <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/440571/107479"">post</a> I flagged as spam myself - you need 10k on EE.SE to see it, though - you can see the downvotes, the deletion, the fact it was sent in moderator review queue, but no explicit trace of a spam flag).</p>

<p>Regarding the NAA flags, I don't see anything in the schema that could directly relate to this.</p>

<p><strong>But why do I need this?</strong></p>

<p>Because there has been this question: <a href=""https://electronics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7003/someone-has-been-upvoting-nonsense-non-answers"">Someone has been upvoting nonsense non-answers</a> on meta EE.SE. And I recently realized that we could actually get some information about <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/331577/325443"">deleted posts</a> on SEDE. So I thought: ""Hey, imma just make a query to get the posts that have upvotes while having been flagged as NAA, to check if there has been an increase of these cases recently!""</p>

<p>But it seems I can't, can I? The only thing I can do is checking if the post has been in the moderator review queue (<code>VoteTypeId = 15</code>), which should have been the case for all flagged posts, whetever the kind of flag raised.</p>

<ul>
<li>Out of all the things someone should know before posting, <strong>what is on-topic is by far the most important</strong>.</li>
<li>What you shouldn't ask (i.e. Primarily Opinion-Based questions, Too Broad questions) is also only mentioned in the one box.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I propose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having the top summary be much more specific. A lot of people are <strong>only going to read the summary</strong> — <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Columbia University and the French National Institute found that 59% of the time people share links without clicking on them</a> — **so it should be as useful as possible. </li>
<li>Moving the stuff about what's on-topic to the top. It is much more important than the other stuff, especially the thing in front of it; stuff from this section such as ""This site is all about getting answers. It's not a discussion forum. There's no chit-chat"" could easily integrate into the on-topic section.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This page should more prominently explain what is on-topic, because the first badge you are told to get makes you read (or scroll through) it.</strong></p>

<p>By that I mean site-specific moderators, not employees/CM/devs as they are entitled to moderate all SE sites.</p>

"331993","Migration lets me vote twice on posts","<p>I've noticed this before, but I didn't have enough data to tell if this is a repro, or if it was a one-off error.</p>

<p>Yesterday, two questions (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/331960/332043"">audio ads</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/331951/332043"">jQuery CDN</a>) were migrated here to MSE from MSO. When I went to check in on both of them, my vote was gone, but the score hadn't changed. As in, my vote was preserved, but I can still vote again. It's not associated with my account I guess.</p>

<p>This happened once on an SO migration to MSO - score and vote count remained intact, but I could vote again on the post. Considering child metas have the same UIDs as its attached main site, this isn't a UID issue (so someone who happens to have my SO UID here on MSE doesn't get ownership of my votes on the migrated posts).</p>

<p>Also, if I do vote on the posts, the score does change. There's no update and re-association of votes going on behind the scenes. My second vote acts like a completely separate vote from a different user, not a caching bug. </p>

<p>In case it wasn't clear, steps to reproduce:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vote on a post</li>
<li>Migration </li>
<li>Vote again </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that this also applies to answers affected by the migration - not just the question </p>

<p>I'm assuming this is a bug, but what's going on here? Why not associate votes with the global account ID to prevent users from voting twice? </p>

<p>This makes it difficult for search engines to find the page when people search for the text inside it to see if the claim is true. It also makes it difficult people who use screen-readers to be able to understand it.</p>

<p>When editing such questions, my long-standing practice is to simply transcribe the words in the graphic directly into the alt-text part of the markdown, cramming it together as one line.</p>

<p>I assume that screen-readers and web-scrapers will happily be able to find it then, and pat myself on the back for making the Internet a more usable place.</p>

The road to such a grand goal is winding and tough; there is a chance of getting lost. It would be great to have a landmark that will help us not to stray from the right path.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/pqS9R.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>International site users have been proposing their metrics that can serve as the landmark to our goal. Questions on international metas: <a href=""https://ru.meta.stackoverflow.com/q/9182/6"">SOru</a>, <a href=""https://es.meta.stackoverflow.com/q/4140/10"">SOes</a>, <a href=""https://pt.meta.stackoverflow.com/q/7825/17539"">SOpt</a>, <a href=""https://ja.meta.stackoverflow.com/q/3016/78"">SOja</a>.</p>

<h3>Main criterias</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>The fewer metrics we use the better</em>. The best option would be if we created a single metric to track our overall progress.</li>
<li><em>Metrics should be interpretable</em>. The goal of these metrics is to show in a simple way how our efforts are bringing about change: what is going well and what the community needs to pay more attention to.</li>
<li><em>Metrics should be universal</em>, in a way we can use them in any Stack Exchange community.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key metrics: Community, Quality, Quantity</h3>

<ol>
<li><em>Community</em>. How comfortable are the users in the community? Are they active on the site? Do they want to invite their colleagues?</li>
<li><em>Quality</em>. How useful and interesting is the knowledge that we create to site users and overall developers?</li>
<li><em>Quantity</em>. How fast is the knowledge base growing? </li>
</ol>

<h3>Summary of the proposed metrics</h3>

<p>The most popular proposed metric in all communities is how many active users join a community opposed to those who leave (so-called ""turnover""). The only difference is in how we determine an “active user”:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of users from the top-100 who created five or more posts per month.</li>
<li>The number of users who earn 300 reputation points for a certain period.</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/13/yearling"">The number of users who earn 200 reputation points and were active for a year</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Btw, please share how would you define an “active user” for this metric?)</p>

<p>Interestingly that we can measure our distance to the goal literally: using services that provide statistics on search engine queries (<a href=""https://wordstat.yandex.ru"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">for instance</a>) we can determine the most popular search queries on programming and compare that with what questions we have on the sites.</p>

<p>Other proposed metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of suspended users separated by suspension reasons.</li>
<li>Number of bookmarks with a link to the site created on social bookmarking sites (<a href=""https://b.hatena.ne.jp/entrylist?url=ja.stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">for instance</a>).</li>
<li>For how long should a person participate on a site to answer more questions than they have asked?</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of thanks to everyone who shared their ideas. I’m going to look at which of the proposed metrics can be implemented and in what form. If you have any ideas on this subject, please ping me in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/84778/the-terminal"">The Terminal</a></p>

<h3>Please keep proposing metrics</h3>

<p>Creating interpretable universal metrics is hard work. Metrics can and should be continuously improved. Please keep proposing your ideas about new metrics and thoughts on improving existing ones in the answers to this question and on international metas. Together we will make it!</p>

This is a community-wiki question which I edit bi-weekly, so it should not count.

The bounty was later cleared by a moderator, who sent the user a private message citing the reason for revoking the bounty (supplied by the user in chat):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have cancelled your bounty on [the question]. Now that the issue you were discussing in chat (presumably why you started this bounty) has been cleared up, we see no need to keep highlighting this question. The original question was resolved a year ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I understand, bounties can be freely applied to any eligible question by anyone with the required rep for any reason, and there is no explicit policy basis that says that bounties can be revoked simply because the moderators feel that there is no need to ""highlight"" a given question. (If there is such a policy, it would mean that bounties intended to be awarded to rather old existing answers wouldn't be permitted, but I see those happening and they don't get cancelled.)</p>

<p>Was there some different reason why the bounty was cancelled? Did the fact that they selected the ""draw attention"" reason play a part in the bounty cancellation? Does the user have a history of abusing bounties that I'm not aware of (hence the mod message warning)? Or was it just a helpful move so that the user doesn't waste the rep?</p>

However, the question body contains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EDIT: I just found out that it was the renaming of the type from <code>foo_t</code> to just <code>foo</code> that broke the syntax highlighting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, it seems clear that the question is now about the ""_t"" suffix, not namespaces.  Furthermore, there is currently just one <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/56002543/2659307"">answer</a> to the question, and it discusses the ""_t"" suffix, not namespaces.</p>

<p>I therefore thought it would be better for the question's title to reflect the current topic, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/23933349"">suggested editing</a> the title to ""Why does a C++ class name stop being syntax highlighted when <strong>the ""_t"" suffix is removed</strong> in VS Code?"" (emphasis added to the new text).</p>

<p>That edit was rejected with the reason, ""This edit deviates from the original intent of the post.""  That is in a sense true, since the <em>original</em> intent was indeed to ask about namespaces.  But the author then <em>changed</em> their intent, and I think if that author were to re-ask the question now, they would mention ""_t"" in the title, not namespaces.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/edit"">editing guidelines</a> say ""When should I edit posts? Any time you feel you can make the post better, and are inclined to do so. Editing is encouraged!"", and that among the reasons to edit is ""to clarify the meaning of a post without changing it"", which is what I thought my edit did, based on the <em>current</em> meaning of the post.</p>

<p>So: should one edit a question title to reflect the current topic when that topic has been changed by the author of the question?  My interpretation of the guidelines would be ""yes"", but the edit rejection suggests ""no"".</p>

<p>Another suggestion: when a user reaches X reputation, add it as a functionality to the user (with a respective indication on the promotion).  This avoids new users being overwhelmed by new features on the start, and at the same time increases exposure of this functionality when users become more used to the website.</p>

"333392","What's responsible for the increase in the number of accounts created every week here on Meta Stack Exchange?","<p>I've noticed that since the past year, the number of accounts created on Meta Stack  Exchange every week has increased noticeably, and has sustained a much higher rate than it has sustained for the previous years.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""https://data.stackexchange.com/meta.stackexchange/query/268232/new-users-by-week#graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">query</a> and a graph:</p>

  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/t8WVd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/t8WVd.png"" alt=""Graph in account creation, showing sudden increase in rate since September 2018""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, the rate of account creation has climbed at a steady but slow pace. The rate got shifted down in early 2014, probably due to the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212631/stack-overflow-is-getting-a-meta-of-its-own"">Meta Stack Overflow-Meta Stack Exchange split</a>, and there's a small blip increase in early 2016 which was caused by <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278562/sudden-increase-in-off-topic-posts-on-mse"">a notification regarding updated Terms of Use that was deployed to all accounts then</a> (a lot of people didn't realize they'd been directed to a different site, and went on to ask their off-topic questions here; this resulted in a temporary period where 2 reputation was required to ask questions here).</p>

<p>However, I can't firmly place anything on the sudden increase that seems to have taken place near the end of 2018, and the fact that it's stayed at that increased rate ever since.</p>

<p>What's responsible for the sudden and sustained increase in account creation here on Meta Stack Exchange? Is there some new external link to this site made after that time? </p>

<p>Or does it has to do with the fact that <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/317299/stack-exchange-area-51-sign-up-log-in-update"">the login flows for stackexchange.com and Area 51 now go through Meta Stack Exchange</a>? (I don't think it's that, since I don't imagine a lot of people login through those paths, and I don't believe that it creates a Meta Stack Exchange account, only providing a login flow.)</p>

"333434","Improved support for React in the code snippet editor?","<h2>Overview of Feedback</h2>

<ul>
<li>Supported React Versions</li>
<li>Development vs. Production</li>
<li>Auto-enable <code>Use BabelJS / ES2015</code></li>
<li>Insert React boilerplate</li>
</ul>

<h2>React Version</h2>

<p>Currently, the newest version of React available in the snippet editor is <code>16.6.3</code>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/7bjSO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7bjSO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Many questions (on Stack Overflow) are around hooks, which were added in version <code>16.8.0</code>.</p>

<p>To work around this, I've been going to the React docs and copying the CDN links provided there: <a href=""https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html</a>. Is there a reason newer versions of React aren't supported? Can the newest versions be added?</p>

<h2>Development vs. Production</h2>

<p>The current links that are added are also the <code>production</code> builds. Given that questions and answers commonly include React specific warnings it would be preferable to have the development bundle with more meaningful warnings directly in the console (rather than links). Is there a reason the production builds are chosen over the development builds? The development build would provide a better experience for both question askers and answerers?</p>

<h2>Auto-enable <code>Use BabelJS / ES2015</code></h2>

<p>Almost every React specific question uses <code>JSX</code> which requires this option to be enabled and can be easy to overlook. Can this option be auto-enabled when selecting a React version?</p>

<h2>Insert React boilerplate</h2>

<p>When enabling React there is almost always the same boilerplate to add a root <code>div</code> and mount the <code>App</code> component. If the editor is empty, could this boilerplate be auto-inserted?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;div id=""root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> in HTML</li>
<li><code>ReactDOM.render( &lt; App / &gt; , document.getElementById(""root""));</code> with a basic <code>App</code> component definition in JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, it would be great if the editor defaulted to something along these lines when selecting a React version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for the newest versions of React</li>
<li><code>Use BabelJS / ES2015</code> auto-enabled since JSX is almost a requirement</li>
<li>Using development builds (instead of production)</li>
<li>Boilerplate HTML/JavaScript added (if empty)</li>

"333474","Downloaded election data bug?","<p>We just had our first Election over at Spanish.SE -- a Pro Tem election, but an election nonetheless 🎉</p>

<p>There were 2 mod positions available. During the nomination phase, 2 candidates entered the competition, as shown in <a href=""https://spanish.stackexchange.com/election/1"">our election page</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0A2ry.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0A2ry.png"" alt=""freehand circle as required""></a></p>

<p>Due to the special nature of Pro Tem elections, having 2 candidates for 2 positions meant that no voting was necessary, so the election was cancelled, and the candidates were appointed without a vote. All clear.</p>

<p>However, I just downloaded the <a href=""https://spanish.stackexchange.com/election/download-result/1"">election data</a>, following the link in the election page's bottom banner.<br>
I got a file called <code>spanish-stackexchange-com-2019-election-results.blt</code>. Its contents are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>0 2
0
""Spanish Language Stack Exchange Moderator Election 2019""
</code></pre>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Now, according to the BLT format (better explained in the English part of <a href=""https://spanish.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3185/13628"">this Meta answer</a>), those numbers seem to mean <em>""0 candidates, 2 slots. No voting. No appointments.""</em></p>

<p>I understand that, since the election was manually cancelled (to skip the voting phase), it might be expected that everything that happened <em>after</em> the cancellation is not reflected in the data file.<br>
However, <strong>the number of candidates <em>was</em> 2 when the election was manually ended. I see no reason for the data to say there were 0 candidates, even if the election was cancelled</strong>.<br>
It should show this instead, at the very least:</p>

<pre><code>2 2
0
""Spanish Language Stack Exchange Moderator Election 2019""
</code></pre>

<p>Which would read as <em>""2 candidates, 2 slots. Election cancelled.""</em>  </p>

<p>It also would serve as proof that there weren't enough candidates to merit a voting phase. Right now, if there were 3 candidates for just 2 slots and the election got cancelled anyway, I guess some people would complain about the file showing 0 candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Is this a bug? Can it be fixed?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>PS: It'd be better if it showed this, of course:</p>

<pre><code>2 2
-2
0
""Charlie""
""Spanish Language Stack Exchange Moderator Election 2019""
</code></pre>

<p>Which would read <em>""2 candidates, 2 slots. Candidate 2 withdraws. No voting. Charlie appointed.""</em>. But given that both the withdrawal and the appointment were manual actions executed after the cancellation, I don't expect those to be reflected in an automatically-generated file.</p>

But reading that there are very few principles actually mentioned in the post, it directs that part to the <a href=""https://www.iab.com/newadportfolio/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Interactive Advertising Bureau's guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So for all our advertising offerings, we are following the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s guidelines as a starting point. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I looked through the actual IAB guidelines (<a href=""https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IABNewAdPortfolio_FINAL_0719.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF</a>), and they seem to be a rather constrained effort to disallow the worst of the worst ad behaviours. But they still allow a lot of annoying behaviour, and are entirely silent on some important aspects. These guidelines are a far cry from the original SE advertising principles.</p>

<p>The IAB guidelines allow the following things</p>

<ul>
<li>animated ads (up to 15 seconds, but flashing, high-contrast animations are not recommended)</li>
<li>interstitial ads (but at least a timer before allowing the user to close is disallowed)</li>
<li>video ads</li>
<li>autoplay audio ads under some circumstances (if the user has audio turned on and the ad has 100% screen coverage)</li>
<li>ads are allowed only up to 30% CPU usage</li>
<li>ads are only allowed 10 HTTP requests on initial load (more requests are allowed after the initial load)</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidelines do disallow some terrible stuff like popup ads or auto-expanding hover ads. But they still allow a lot of rather annoying stuff, and are entirely silent on important topics like the actual topics of ads and privacy issues like tracking and fingerprinting.</p>

<p>The title of the blog post is ""Our Advertising Principles"", but the only principles I can actually parse from it are that SE will try to be a bit better than what's in that document. This is really not telling us much, especially as the IAB guidelines allow some ads that are arguably worse than what is currently running on SE sites.</p>

<p>What are the actual advertising principles of SE? Which types of ads are allowed, how much animation is allowed, are ads allowed to track and fingerprint users, how closely must ads relate to the topic of the site, which topics and types of ads are not allowed at all (e.g. pseudo-science, dubious health ads, gambling, scams, ...)?</p>

<li>On Sep 19, 16:51 CDT, another author corrected this usage. </li>
<li>At the same date and time, another author decided to ""correct"" the correction by reverting it to nonstandard usage.</li>

In order for me to even post this question, it asked me to ""Confirm new account"" and at this point I already know that it is creating yet another account for me. If I try to Cancel, it just refreshes the page still asking me to confirm my new account.</p>

<p>So I started with Stack Overflow. I had an account on there for over a year that I just recently started using and participating with.  The account link used to be : <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/9542490/victoria-stampfli"">https://stackoverflow.com/users/9542490/victoria-stampfli</a>
I had some reputation and badges on there. Until one day, when I downloaded the Stack Exchange app, logged in with my Stack Overflow account and decided to check out other sites on Stack Exchange. The first comment I made on another site gave me the all-famous ""Confirm your new account"" page with no ability to cancel in order to proceed. So when I confirmed, I got new url  (<a href=""https://stackexchange.com/users/13212883/user194995"">https://stackexchange.com/users/13212883/user194995</a>) with new account, no reputation, all my history is gone.  Except in the top menu, if you go up there you can still see all the notifications of my previously earned badges etc. Though no badges on the profile. When I try to go to the old url for my original account, it says :""Page not found"". 
So I contacted support by using the sites form twice now and have not heard anything back. Now I am on here asking this question trying to figure out how this whole thing works, and it asked my to ""confirm my new account"" yet again just to ask this question. I am quite confused with all these accounts. I would really like to have my original account back.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

"333808","Text nodes directly inside spoilers are broken in mobile view","<p><a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/89479"">This answer on puzzling.SE</a> looks rather weird in the mobile view:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/AaPpb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AaPpbm.png"" alt=""Screenshot of broken spoiler;""><br>Click to enlarge.</a></p>

<p>Notice how some of the text that's supposed to be hidden inside the spoiler is actually shown above the ""click to show spoiler"" notice.  Even worse, when you do click the box, the previously hidden content is revealed <em>but the text that used to be shown disappears!</em></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SdyhY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SdyhYm.png"" alt=""Screenshot of broken spoiler after clicking;""><br>Click to enlarge.</a></p>

<hr>

<p>It turns out that this bug is easy to reproduce: all you have to do is trick the Markdown parser into placing some text directly inside the spoiler <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> with no other tags in between.  One way to do that is to include block-level HTML tags like <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> inside the spoiler and have some text immediately after them, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;! This is some hidden spoiler text.
&gt;! &lt;pre&gt;This is preformatted text / code inside the spoiler.&lt;/pre&gt;
&gt;! This text should be hidden inside the spoiler, but in the mobile view it's not (unless it's in *italics* or **boldface**).
</code></pre>

<p>Which renders like this:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> This is some hidden spoiler text.
 <pre>This is preformatted text / code inside the spoiler.</pre>
 This text should be hidden inside the spoiler, but in the mobile view it's not (unless it's in <em>italics</em> or <strong>boldface</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To see how broken that looks in the mobile view, just scroll down and click the ""Mobile"" link in the footer.</p>

<hr>

<p>In fact, the cause of this bug is also easy to find.  In <a href=""http://cdn-dev.sstatic.net/Js/mobile.en.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mobile.js</a>, the spoiler hiding is done using the following piece of JS code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// replace all .spoiler's with a ""click to show"" box
var hideSpoilers = function () {
    $('.spoiler').each(
        function (index, i) {
            var item = $(i);

            item.removeClass('spoiler').addClass('spoiler-overlay');
            var children = item.children();  // &lt;-- THE BUG IS HERE!

            children.remove();

            item.append('&lt;div class=""spoiler-click-to-show""&gt;' + ""Click to show spoiler"" + '&lt;/div&gt;');

            item.one(
                'click',
                function () {
                    item.empty();
                    item.append(children);
                    item.removeClass('spoiler-overlay').addClass('spoiler');
                }
            );
        }
    );
};
</code></pre>

<p>I've added a comment above pointing out where the bug is: on the marked line, the code uses the jQuery <a href=""https://api.jquery.com/children/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>.children()</code></a> method when it <em>should</em> be using <a href=""https://api.jquery.com/contents/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>.contents()</code></a>.</p>

<p>The difference between the two functions is that <code>.children()</code> only returns the HTML tags nested inside the parent tag, but skips over any text nodes that are direct descendants of the parent.  So, for example, given the HTML code:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;blockquote class=""spoiler""&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This is some hidden spoiler text.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;pre&gt;This is preformatted text / code inside the spoiler.&lt;/pre&gt;

   This text should be hidden inside the spoiler, but in the mobile view
   it's not (unless it's in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;boldface&lt;/strong&gt;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>calling <code>.children()</code> on the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element will select the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags and their contents, but not the text that is placed directly inside the blockquote.</p>

<p>Anyway, just changing that single line of code to use the correct jQuery method should be sufficient to fix this bug.</p>

"334025","So disappointed to see the fall out this week","<p>I stepped down as moderator on Stack Overflow 10 days ago. There were many reasons, mainly tiredness and being time poor, if I'm to be honest with myself.</p>

<p>Participating on this network has always been an emotional challenge for me and I always assumed it was because of my personality. Watching things unfold I'm more inclined to think maybe it's the just interacting with people generally that's challenging. </p>

<p>I joined Stack Overflow 8? years ago and soon joined other Stack Exchange sites. I rallied for better behaviour on Stack Overflow Meta from early on. This is before the site split into Meta Stack Exchange and Meta Stack Overflow (MSO). I didn't like the pile on and the snark in comments in MSO. The site has come a long way in improving things in many ways, but now there seems to be challenges in how the Stack Exchange Company is communicating with its communities.</p>

<p>So in these ten days off Stack Overflow, I've been contacted and kept abreast of the events unfolding across the Network many times a day and actually ended up spending more time and attention on the site than I was when I was moderating.</p>

<p>It disappoints me to see the amount of vitriol pouring out onto the site. Emotions are high, but disappointment is not an excuse to lower the bar of our standards. It doesn't matter who or what was in the wrong. Many of us have worked hard to try and make this place more bearable for participants and now everywhere I look there's cynicism and accusations.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don't think the Network (being the company) sometimes handles things well. In my, not so humble opinion, they need to work on shoring up and restoring community faith. But I don't think there's any malice.</p>

<h2>We don't have all the facts and we're not entitled to know</h2>

<p>I look at the employees and wonder how many of them will survive this latest public outrage and in some ways I feel sorry for these people. We don't know the exact ins and out of what has gone on. We do not know who actually decided to remove diamonds or who or why the when and way of it was chosen.</p>

<p>There's a lot of missing pieces that none of us know and when there's a lack of trust, it's often coloured in with the worst scenarios.</p>

<p>All I'm saying is, it's so disappointing to see the deterioration on the site. All round. The way things have been handled by the business end and the reactions that seems to be gaining momentum.</p>

<h2>Check your motives</h2>

<p>There comes a point when we're posting on these sites, we need to ask. Am I doing this to achieve something good? Or am I stirring the pot? Digging up more mud? </p>

<p>Whatever the point. I don't believe any one moderator should be named, nor should any one employee. It's not right.</p>

<p>Questions like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333999/will-we-really-have-democratic-moderator-elections"">Will we really have &quot;democratic&quot; moderator elections?</a></p>

<p>This type of title is created to stir up emotions. It infers bad intentions on the part of the employees. I don't know what is going to happen, I highly doubt the employees know what they'll do just yet. It's a new thing. They may well appoint people, like they have on the Beta sites until they can hold elections. This whole reaction may cause the establishment to change how they select moderators altogether.</p>

<p>All I can see are a bunch of employees who don't like posting on Meta on a good day. The more emotion that is poured out here, the less likely there will be real community input. If the main impetus coming from the community is sour, if it were my business, I'd work to silence the community.</p>

<p>People need to ask themselves. Do they want to keep pushing at this organisation to force the very thing they don't want to see happen to really happen. Or are people willing to take a step back, take a breath and wait. Give the employees time to develop a strategy. Put into place a contingency plan.</p>

<p>Clearly there is a lack of trust in the employees. That's fine, no one has to trust anyone. But it does beg the question. If you are hating on the site so much, why are you rallying so hard against these people? What good do you think may come from it?</p>

<p>This post may be met with downvotes and not be unpopular, but the way the community is reacting all over the meta sites, makes me not want to be on these sites. It reminds me of the early meta days. When things were hot and unruly. </p>

<p>I'm just very disappointed to see the sites take this backward step. It doesn't matter how outraged people are, there's always at least three sides to any story. As Bs and the objective C (programming pun intended). In this type of situation there's a lot more than 3 sides and people are expecting employees to reveal a side they cannot. </p>

<h2>A lot of people are hurting</h2>

<p>Many people have been hurt. Many people that are not here to speak up, but were active members of these communities. People who were respected by our communities. Much of what has occurred has gone behind the scenes. Moderators and employees are bound by contracts of confidentiality. Even if you step down or leave the job, it doesn't mean you can go repeating things that were part of your job that were private. It's as much to protect users than anything else, as moderators have access to Personal Identifying Information. People are entitled to their privacy.</p>

<h2>The sites have changed</h2>

<p>There's a lot about these sites that has changed. They will never be the same, it's the nature of the business and the internet. All I'm asking if for some calm. If at all possible. All this hard work so many of us have lovingly put into these sites. Many of us are still here. Please don't trash the sites as you're leaving.  </p>

<p>All this effort put into these sites and to see it degenerate this way. And before people cry ""but the network doesn't respect the Code of Conduct"" whatever ails you, whatever injustice you see. It doesn't justify breaking the Code of Conduct or trampling over people. Never. It never does. The employees are people too. </p>

<p>I'm posting this, not to cause trouble, not to argue, not to create another place for people to vent their feelings, but to have one space where people can feel, maybe someone else on here wants peace too. Maybe someone else wants calm.</p>

<p>I'm not even sure what I'm trying to articulate, beyond how disappointed I am in the deterioration of the site. And that behaviour is on the people writing inflamed posts and comments. Each person is responsible for their own behaviour.  It's not ok to smash things as you leave the room.  </p>

"334157","Improved experience when joining a new community","<p>I noticed a few things that are sub-optimal when joining a new community.</p>

<p>When you are creating a new profile on a site with an existing network profile, the default behavior is to apply a display name, bio, location, URLs, etc to the profile that comes from the existing account. Although this may seem like a good default, there should be a way to opt out of it. Personally, I prefer using the same user name (which happens to be my real time) on the different communities, but I can definitely see a place where people may want to have better isolation between their profiles on different communities while still maintaining a single network account.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where this profile comes from, since it's synched at the Stack Exchange level across all sites (including stackexchange.com).</p>

<p>However, I'd propose a method that allows you to optionally import your profile. The default could be use what is in your Stack Exchange profile, but ideally you should be able to import it from any site on the network or import it from no sites on the network.</p>

<p>In the event that you do not import the profile from an existing site, the default behavior should also be to hide the community from your other profiles. It should be difficult for someone to link your newly created profile to your other profiles on SE sites.</p>

<p>I believe that this will help people who wish to remain more anonymous and use the network in different contexts. Perhaps someone who wants a certain display name (perhaps their real name and bio) on sites they use in a professional context while a pseudonym on sites that are related to recreational activities. It can help improve privacy across the network, and should be able to leverage much of the current profile synchronization tools that exist today.</p>

"334242","Can we make changes to the quoted portion in a question or answer?","<p>We know that we can edit to correct spelling, grammar of questions and answer. But what about the portion in block quotes? Do we have the liberty of correcting grammar, punctuation or terminology in the quoted portion? </p>

<p>I ask this question because I have seen a few suggested edits which change the terminology used in quoted translation to emphasize something or adding a meaning in brackets. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The girl said to the boy, ""<em>Au Revoir</em>"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there is an edit suggested to this line giving meaning of this French word with an edit reason of adding translation to the key phrases</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The girl said to the boy, ""<em>Au Revoir</em>"" (meaning Good Bye)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another case is changing the translation like <a href=""https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/19116"">this</a>. </p>

<p>So far I have rejected such suggested edits because what is quoted are not own words of the OP but some quoted translation of some author. I believe changing terminology from the originally used words in the quoted part is changing the intent of the author who originally wrote. </p>

<p>For example, there are many translations for many non English books. For instance, The Bible has a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_Bible_translations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">long list of English Bible translations</a> and interpretations. Translator A might have interpreted and translated XYZ word as ABC. Now a user suggests an edit to change this ABC because the term used by translator A is not accurate and its interpretation is debatable.</p>

<p>Besides these, we see sometimes articles quoted in questions and answers also have minor grammatical errors. While correcting posts, is it right to correct grammar in articles too?</p>

<p>So, what should be the correct action if we see edits which alter the content which is not in the original? Should we approve or reject these changes?</p>

"334728","Can a fired moderator be elected as a moderator?","<p>While this question is inspired by recent events, it is an independent question and not tied down to any specific moderator or situation.</p>

<p>There's precedent for a moderator who <em>resigned</em> their diamond to simply ask Stack Exchange for their diamond back, without having to stand for reelection. Obviously, this may not apply if the moderator did not resign, but was removed <em>for cause</em> by Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>If a moderator has been ""fired"" by Stack Exchange (has had their diamond removed involuntarily by corporate action), is the person eligible to pull a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marion Barry</a> and regain a diamond through the democratic process on one of our sites, or would any such attempt be blocked? I'm aware that there is a restriction on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/274114/336163"">users who have received a full site suspension in the past year</a> from standing for election, but this is not the same thing as being stripped of a diamond (fired moderators, IME, aren't also given a <em>full site suspension</em> unless their behavior goes beyond ""possibly not a very good moderator"" into ""supervillain"" territory).</p>

<p>If there is no particular rule, what should that rule be?</p>

<ul>
<li>Should fired moderators be immediately eligible to stand for election, subject only to community approval of them returning?</li>
<li>Should fired moderators have to go through a separate re-vetting process with Stack Exchange to regain eligibility to stand for office?</li>
<li>Should fired moderators have an ineligibility window in a similar way that suspended users have one (e.g. after X months or years after being fired, they may stand for election).</li>
<li>Should fired moderators be forever banned from election?</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>no way</em> am I asking about the process for a fired moderator to seek restoration through corporate appeals, etc. I'm asking only about the community election process - if a site's community wants to elect a previously fired moderator, is this inherently objectionable to Stack Exchange?</p>

<p>As someone who has long consumed StackExchange, StackOverflow, SuperUser, but only within the past few years posted questions or answers, I am confused and frustrated by the whole reputation thing.  I understand why reputation exists, but it is frustrating to want to upvote, comment, answer, or whatever, and be told you are not allowed because you don't have sufficient reputation.  If I had some new original questions I needed to ask, then I could gain reputation, but ""the system"" seems to think I am unworthy or clueless to be able to contribute or assess.</p>

But when I went to Stack Exchange for a question on OS X stuff, I have to start over with 1 rep.  Seems a bit like a slap in the face, particularly since (so far as I know) some questions could appear either place.</p>

<p>Yes, I have ready folks talking about exchanging bounty and how it is more difficult to earn rep on SE than SO, and I don't claim to know all about bounty and the ins and outs of types of rep.  But I do know that I feel as if I have to start over in each meeting place for technical questions, and it is a disincentive (for me) to be involved.</p>

<p>I realize not all (maybe nobody) will agree with my sentiment, but since I only have 1 rep, I guess folks' downvotes won't hurt me, right?</p>

<p>That comment struck me as a somewhat insensitive use of irony. It didn't strike me as sufficiently rude to warrant an <em>unfriendly or unkind</em> flag, but it did seem chatty and tangential, so I flagged it as ""no longer needed"". My flag was declined.</p>

"335319","How can I keep track of all the developments surrounding the current controversy?","<p>As I'm sure most readers are probably aware of by now, there has been an ongoing controversy for the last couple of weeks surrounding the new Code of Conduct, the removal of a moderator, many moderator resignations, and other assorted related issues.</p>

<p>It seems that there are a couple dozen new Meta questions related to this group of events appearing every day. These questions routinely generate tens of answers and hundreds of comments. I am finding it somewhat difficult to keep track of all the different posts and to keep abreast of the latest developments.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any unique marker linking all of these discussions together. It seems like one just has to scroll through every Meta post to find the relevant ones. Even when you do find them, by the time you finish reading them there are another ten questions/answers that have since been posted.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that many people have limited amounts of time they can spend perusing Meta per day, and many people have stretches of time when they can't visit Meta. If someone only has an hour a day to devote to this, or can only check in a few times a week, it seems impossible to actually be able to read everything, or even to approach that level.</p>

<p><strong>My question is thus:</strong> Is there any way we can organize things to make it easier for readers to follow what's going on? Perhaps a tag or series of tags? Perhaps a dedicated Meta post that lists all the posts relating to theses events, perhaps also subdivided by more specific topics (e.g. posts about the Code of Conduct, posts about pronouns, posts about moderators, etc.). Or some other way that I have not mentioned? I imagine this would be help readers find all the relevant posts to read, and help readers with limited resources determine which posts to allocate them to.</p>

<p>Would something like this be feasible? Would something like this be desirable?</p>

"335349","More needs to be done against anti-semitic posts on Stack Exchange","<p>Today, there was <em>yet again</em> an <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/45217"">anti-semitic question</a> on Stack Exchange, about Nazi Germany's actions against the Jews.</p>

<p>What do I mean by ""yet again""? Well, in this <a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4324"">Skeptics meta question</a> from February this year, I noted that half of the ""helpful"" flags on questions on Skeptics.SE were about the holocaust, and approximately half of the remainder were about Jews or Nazi Germany. And the majority of the questions I flagged for holocaust denial were around for more than two hours, ranging from 6 minutes to 8 hours, 20 minutes.</p>

<p>And is it just Skeptics.SE? Nope, here's a quick sample from History.SE. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/43621"">One</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/39112"">two</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/34600"">three</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/34312"">four</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/29097"">five</a> - and that's not going all the way back in my flag history. There have been some problematic content on Politics.SE, but usually it's less blatantly antisemitic, apart from <a href=""https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/4562"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a problem with diamond moderators. They've tended to do the right thing, and the fact that it happens on more than one site indicates it's probably not an issue with a particular moderator. I also believe that the smoke detector tries to deal with this.</p>

<p>I don't think it's an unsolvable problem - it seems to be the a very small handful of people or groups posting the same hateful garbage again and again every few months, for example compare <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/45217"">Were Nazis favorable to zionism?</a> and <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44757"">https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44757</a>.</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I want Stack Exchange to act on all bigotry, and I've flagged on a variety of bigotries (people who are bigoted against Jews are also bigoted against other groups), but this is the particular ongoing problem I've faced in my experience as a non-diamond-moderator high-rep user.</p>

<p>While (heavily regulated) gambling is legal in my jurisdiction, I consider advertisements for online gambling to be inappropriate on SE. This ad is particularly objectionable, because as far as I can tell (French is not my first language) it seems to be surreptitiously aimed at an underage audience by suggesting online gambling as a way to pass ""5 minutes de lecture"" (5 minutes of reading), which I understand is an expression commonly used in schools.  </p>

The regular tag view on a specific site already greys out questions with ignored tags, but 'not even' that is happening in this view.</p>

<p>A mistake I see many new users make on their questions is to respond to comments on their questions by posting an ""answer"" which should be either a follow-up comment or, if it's longer (e.g. adding sample code) as an edit to their question.  They do this because they do not realize they can edit questions.</p>

<p>I participate on a different Q&amp;A site which runs an open-source Q&amp;A site framework, and it has (for users with enough rep) a ""repost answer as comment"" button:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/becd1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/becd1.png"" alt=""screenshot of &quot;repost as a question comment&quot; button""></a></p>

<p>For SE the above might not work as-is, since many (non-)answers could be too long to be a comment.  There could be both options: for short non-answers they could be re-posted as a comment.  For longer non-answers it could automatically append an edit to their question with some appropriate text indicating where the edit came from.  Something like:</p>

<p><strong>Updated (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm via migration from answer):</strong></p>

<pre><code>[text of non-answer follows]
</code></pre>

<p>This can be done manually of course, but I see this problem often enough that it might be helpful to have an automated approach.</p>

<p>Or, if nothing else, perhaps a tool-tip/flash notice to new-users when they are about to post an answer to their own question that they can also <em>edit</em> their question to provide new information.</p>

This change and the force to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead seems to me very odd and counterproductive. I am looking for a reasons to understand this change.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Some time ago an edit box that holds permalink to selected question or answer (and the whole ""Share"" functionality) was changed. The <em>cut</em> operation / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> shortcut is no longer supported. Only <em>copy</em> operation / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> shortcut is now supported.</p>

<p>For years of using SE I learnt myself a quick combination of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> (cut) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> (switch tab) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (paste). This is no longer working.</p>

<p>In general, way outside SE, I am much more used to actually <em>cutting</em> piece of text from source rather than <em>copying</em> it. Reasons seems quite obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When cutting, source text disappears and you can -- without looking at the keyboard -- be sure that you hit the correct combination of keys and it is ""safe"" to do quick switch to another tab and even quicker paste.</p></li>
<li><p>When copying, source text remains in place and you are not sure, if you hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or missed a key, until you look at the keyboard or until you actually try to paste text.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For person that is writing (and copying and pasting) without looking at the keyboard and who is writing at approx. 300 letters per minute these few milliseconds break can do the difference. Especially, if you do dozens of copy-paste operations per minute.</p>

<p>Above mentioned change and the need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> seems quite odd to my and certainly is very counterproductive. It forces me to change the combination that I've been using for years, semi-automatic. I'd like to understand reasons behind that change.</p>

And an <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336364/286110"">another revision</a> of CoC was introduced. </p>

<p>What I want to know is: </p>

<ul>
<li>has this always been the case that a new revision of a policy was preceded by suppression of the information by limiting access to the earlier revision(s) of the policy?</li>
<li><p>The urge to set things right, or otherwise, might tempt a person (includes legal persons) to suppress the information which is not in that person's interest. However, given that the community has a direct stake in a policy, shouldn't transparency (access to information - necessary for individuals to know the past and to frame convincing arguments in the future if an aforesaid person makes a similar or a more severe mistake) be given priority here? </p>

<p>I can neither find nor can access any reason on the deleted post for its deletion. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that the question was received negatively with votes and most of the addresses to it in the comments and the answers further added to that negative outlook. I also know that some individuals took the criticism as the opportunity 
to  channel their disdain towards certain gender groups (I flagged one on my answer a few hours ago) which probably might have overburdened and also put in a very difficult situation the moderators of this meta. But difficulty in moderation doesn't justify the deletion  of the source. Locking down the post for a certain period could have been adequate for ""reasons of Moderation"". </p>

<p>It can be argued that the deletion would put to rest some of the controversy by restricting access to controversial information so that new or unsuspecting users can focus on what matters to the company (but not necessarily to the community), but given that those who are most vocal on both sides of the spectrum already has consumed the information or has accees to it (10k privilege), how is deletion beneficial to both the community and the company? </p>

<p>Preventing new or unsuspecting users from knowing the mistakes / blunders hardly justifies deletion.  On the contrary, this action could be deemed as a policy to handle a negatively received policy -- damage control to be precise. </p>

<p>So, what good (and for whom) would come out of the aforesaid taken action? </p>

<p>Note: I am not trying to incite anyone to go on a rage towards anyone, including the company. I am aghast by the severity of the action and its possible consequences and trying to seek sense out of it. </p>

"336610","Radical proposal: Meta sites should not use the same software as the main sites","<p>There has been a lot of discussion lately about the toxicity of the Meta sites, whether in reference to users, moderators, or SE staff (e.g., <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336556/139256"">[1]</a><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/stack-overflow-is-doing-me-ongoing-harm-its-time-to-fix-it"">[2]</a> from the past few days). I would venture that much of the problem comes from the fact that SE has created a tool—the SE platform—that they are applying much too broadly, and that there are many discussions that do not benefit from the ""single question, multiple answer, upvote/downvote"" approach.</p>

<p>The goal of meta is to discuss and resolve issues occurring on the main site. Note that ""discuss"" is one of the goals; the SE platform is <em>specifically constructed</em> to minimize any form of discussion. Comments are non-threaded; they occur wherever they're left. They're also minimized to just show the five most ""popular"" comments, which—when posted as part of a nuanced discussion—almost always are shown without context, making it even more difficult to understand what's flying. Chat is almost completely dissociated from the main platform, aside from usernames and some convenience question formatting capabilities.</p>

<p>The ""single question/multiple answer"" approach of Meta is equally unsuited to discussion. A discussion will start with a single question, but will branch out into arguments supporting different positions, and will even more frequently lead to other related points. There is no ""best answer"" in a discussion. Different answers will frequently say the same point, but slightly differently, and there's no way to indicate that other than ""As bob said..."". Even worse, the concept of an ""answer"" to a discussion makes no sense; it's a back and forth, a give and take. The current platform would require the OP to create a whole new question just to address the points brought up in the answer.</p>

<p>Even worse is the voting. Arguments and discussions follow the format of ""proposition ➞ discussion ➞ stronger proposition"". The voting on a single answer indicates... what? In most cases, it indicates that (1) it wasn't stupid and (2) it was posted quickly. It also strongly indicates <em>popularity</em>, which isn't that strongly correlated with <em>quality</em>. It definitely does NOT indicate that the answer is particularly <em>good</em>, as many good arguments are often posted later and almost completely ignored.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, what to do? I don't know. This is a discussion. There are many tools for enabling discussions, from online BBs to mind maps (e.g., <a href=""https://www.rationaleonline.com/map/u6h2m4/render_export/group-7.png?png_width=1024"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this sort of thing</a>), and most mediocre at best. That said, I think the SE platform is <em>particularly</em> poorly suited here, given it's specific goal of enabling people to answer specific questions with direct, factual, no-discussion-needed answers.</p>

<p>My question is, does the system only look at at similarities or does it also take into account dissimilarities? For instance if Post A and Post B have 100 (non-trivial) words in common, and Post A and Post C have 101 (non-trivial) words in common, would A and C be more related than A and B even if A and B were exact duplicates while A and C also had 1,000 words not in common?</p>

<p>If this is indeed how it works, then the longer a post is the greater chance it has of being related to other posts simply by virtue of having more words. Taken to the extreme, an infinitely long post — even consisting entirely of nonsense/gibberish — would automatically be related to every other post.</p>

<p>However, doing this apparently leaves the network profile unchanged.  This is surprising and unexpected.  It seems like a design flaw.</p>

<p>There are circumstances where a moderator needs to clear a user's profile (e.g., because it is abusive or violates our guidelines).  In those circumstances, we need to clear the user's network profile, too.  Moderators should be given that capability, without needing to contact a community moderator.  I don't see much of a risk or harm.</p>

<p>Also, when we need to clear a user's profile because of abusive content, there is no indication that clearing their profile leaves the network profile untouched, or that we need to contact a CM.  This is a trap for the unwary.</p>

(Yeah, late to the party, I know. Maybe they've even stopped working on improving the new mod dashboard now. Anyway.)</p>

<p>In the new moderator dashboard, flags on <strong>posts</strong> can either be marked helpful or declined. Clicking on ""helpful ..."" or ""decline ..."" gives us the option to enter a custom reason for the flagging user to see. There's also a button to delete the post directly, which automatically marks the flag helpful:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/D1ol4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/D1ol4.png"" alt=""buttons for post flag""></a></p>

<p>However, for flags on <strong>comments</strong> we have far less options: it's just ""delete"", ""edit"", and ""decline"". There's no natural way to mark a comment flag helpful without deleting or editing the comment (the only workaround is to delete the comment and immediately undelete it, or make a null edit to it). There's no way to give feedback to the flagger on a comment flag, not even canned reasons to explain why it was declined.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know comments are third-class citizens and all, but does the comment flag process need to be so basic? Would it be difficult to <strong>use the same code for comment flags as for post flags</strong>, giving mods the option to provide custom decline feedback or to mark a flag as helpful without just hitting the delete button?</p>

<ul>
<li>This change would waste zero mod time in cases where you just want to delete stuff: if there's a red ""delete"" button like for posts, you can hit that and bypass the helpful/decline dichotomy.</li>

"337854","Which SE community should I post a question about the technical details of search engines?","<p>I want to ask a question about how Google (and other search engines) manage complex developer related searches when dealing with different versions of different software, etc. Which community would be best suited for answering such a question?</p>

<p>Here, I'll just write the question out as if I was posting it. The rest of this post is the question I'd like to ask but don't know exactly where to put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've noticed for some time now that Google (as amazing of a search
  engine as it is) and Amazon, as well as other large search platforms
  are still having a difficult time producing relevant results when
  searching for version specific information. Why does this seem to
  still be such a difficult feat to pull off?</p>
  
  <p>For example let's say I'd like to find out how to install rvm on
  ubuntu. Here's the search I might perform: ""installing rvm ubuntu"".</p>
  
  <p>I find it odd that - by default, the first several results are all for
  Ubuntu 16 or 14 ... articles that are clearly written several years
  ago; especially considering I'm searching from an Ubuntu 19.10
  machine. It seems that would be taken into account.</p>
  
  <p>I've also noticed oddities when searching version specific issues.
  Notably Apache, MySQL, Ruby, PHP (PHP searches are horrible with
  Google) and Python is pretty bad as well.</p>
  
  <p>I've even had a few times where I entered a non-version question, got
  a pretty dated result set, then decided to clarity by adding version
  numbers, and ended up with an even more dated result set. I don't even
  understand how that's possible.</p>
  
  <p>That, combined with the fact that Google should know my searches
  pretty well by now. After years of development related searches,
  shouldn't it be fairly well up-to-date with what versions I'm
  currently using and what I'm looking for?</p>
  
  <p>So, I'm really just technically curious as to why this seems to still
  be an issue.</p>
  
  <p>I get that google is complex, and it's probably well beyond my
  capability to grasp exactly what it's doing behind the scenes. In no
  way am I knocking it. However, given that such odd results seem to
  still be so abundant and so similar across the megalithic software
  groups (Amazon is pretty bad at this as well - returning the exact
  model numbers your searching for first seems to be something it is
  utterly incapable of doing), I suspect then that it's probably a
  technical hurdle that we've still not figured out collectively.</p>
  
  <p>What exactly <em>is</em> that hurdle? Why does it seem from the user's end to
  still have such a difficult time with it all?</p>

"337971","Change the ""community wiki thingy"" so that it won't deadname users","<p>I recently realized that, even though I changed my username a while ago (more than six months), some of my old community wiki answers are still displaying the wrong username. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Example of displayed username: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Ws8k7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Ws8k7.png"" alt=""community wiki, 50 revs, 7 users 72% Sonic the Inclusive Hedgehog""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This bug has already been reported <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/47474/400547"">here</a> in 2010 but they declined the idea of fixing it (because they <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/47474/old-usernames-stick-to-community-wiki-posts#comment360042_47522"">""didn't care""</a>).</p>

<p>We are now <em>9</em> years later and I do believe it's time for SE Inc to re-think this.</p>

<p>I know SE Inc is trying to be more inclusive and that the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336366/400547"">new Code of Conduct</a> is part of it. That's why I believe <strong>not</strong> deadnaming users should be something they would like to do too. </p>

<p>I am (mostly) fine with <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/31851/400547"">old comments deadnaming me</a>. However, seeing the ""wiki thing"" doing the same things isn't as nice. Especially since old answers of mine <strong>do</strong> use my updated username. </p>

<hr>

<p><sub>To be clear, I don't like seeing my old username in comments. But I can understand that changing that would cost a lot. And, anyway, since comments are supposed to be temporary, I can always flag to delete them.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>Also, there is a reason for the fact I changed my username and I don't want to attract unnecessary attention about this several <em>months</em> later. So, just ""editing all my old wiki answers"" isn't really an option for me (not one I like, anyway). </p>

"338571","The review sticky panel should actually be sticky","<p>Currently, the sticky review result panel is causing the page to jump up and down as I scroll. It's irritating. This is because JavaScript is changing it from <code>position: static;</code> to <code>position: fixed;</code>. It should just have <code>position: sticky;</code>.</p>

<p>Exacerbating this issue is that the close description is now displayed even if you click the <a href=""//"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(less)</a> link, making the bar take up a considerable amount of the screen – and so rendering areas of the page literally impossible to bring into view unless I make my browser window massive.

An estimate is fine, I think of an overview.</p>

But it would be of value for politics beta, to understand whether it is practically US politics, or more diverse. It's of some relevance for Europeans not used to strict party separation.</p>

<p>I had a tab open with the close review queue for a specific question. For whatever reason, I ended up opening the question itself in a new tab. I then voted to close the question from the new tab, not from the review queue. Then I went back to the tab with the review queue and I was able to vote to leave the question open.</p>

<p>A number of times, I've composed questions on SE or searched for questions and answers that solve problems I've had and found that all or most of the answers were very old, sometimes 10 years or more. Given that these are typically technical questions in areas like HTML or CSS which have often evolved in leaps and bounds over the years, I am less than confident that I'm seeing the best answers to these questions. I often expect there are new and better solutions to the problems that what was done a decade or more in the past. </p>

<p>What should I be doing in those cases? I'm concerned that if I ask the question again, it might just be treated as a duplicate question and get pointed to answers that may well be far from optimum. Would anyone see followup questions like ""Is this still the best approach now that considerable time has passed?"" if I added them as comments to the original question?</p>

<p>I can't believe this is a new issue or question. There must be a standard approach to this; I'm just not sure what it is. </p>

  <p>That’s why we’re creating a <strong>working group of users</strong> made up of people from all corners of the developer community — from folks new to programming, those who don’t participate in Stack Overflow but are passionate about programming, experienced Stack Overflow users, frequent contributors, and more.

<blockquote>
  <p>To address the challenges we identified, we’re putting together a <strong>moderator advisory team</strong> drawn from our 550 existing moderators (folks who volunteer their time and donate their knowledge and leadership to the community): a small, self-replacing council of moderators who will be tasked with keeping our moderation guidance and methods up-to-date, along with ad-hoc working groups of moderators to work on specific initiatives as needed</p>

<p>With recent events across the Stack Exchange network, there are a lot of new faces around here on Meta Stack Exchange. Welcome! However, one thing I've noticed that may be causing a couple sticking points is that the people who are starting (or renewing in some cases) their participation due to recent events may have a different idea of what the site is as opposed to the people who have been sticking around Meta.SE as regulars since before this happened.</p>

<p>In light of this, I'd like to ask for <em>your personal opinion</em> (<em>*gasp*</em>). <strong>What purpose does Meta.SE serve in your eyes?</strong></p>

<p>For instance, it could be a place to report bugs that affect the network; it could be a place to have important discussions that relate to the network; it could be a place to interact with staff; it could be a place to air your grievances; it could be your community. Or anything else.</p>

<p>Knowing how different people view the site may help to shed light on decisions that have been made, such as relating to moderation, and might help people understand others' point of a view a bit more.</p>

Please keep your posts as neutral as possible; this isn't the place to solve any issues, it's just to gather information on how different people use the site.

"340301","Is it possible to get info about where my link was published and where the traffic comes from?","<p>This morning I got the 25-view announcer bronze badge for a question on Arqade. It was a pleasant surprise, since I think the code I wrote for Kittens Game automation was pretty neat and I'm glad that people seem to enjoy it.</p>

<p>But then I noticed I got a hat. So I looked at the hat, and it said I had a gold badge! So I went to my network profile and, all in the span of 24 hours, I got the bronze, silver, and gold badges for sharing the link of a post. Wow, this is fascinating, I thought.</p>

<p>It is certainly odd for a link of mine to get 1,000 clicks in a single day! It would be really good to know where these clicks came from. Surely the browsers that click in have some referer data or something. </p>

<p>Is it at all possible to investigate the source of these clicks? Because I haven't posted anything recently, so clearly someone else has shared something that has my referral code in the URL, and I'd really like to see where that is!</p>

"340306","Are there official translations of the phrase ""Stack Exchange"" into languages other than English?","<p>I was thinking of how to say ""Stack Exchange"" in Chinese, but realized the same question could apply to any language.  And given that several Stack Exchange sites are not in English, there may be an answer to...</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Are there official translations of the phrase ""Stack Exchange"" into languages other than English?</p>

<p>In principle, I could simply translate ""stack"" (the version of this word that relates to programming) and ""exchange"", an stick them together.  But even then it's not easy.  In Chinese:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://youdao.com/w/%E5%A0%86%E6%A0%88"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">堆栈</a> (duīzhàn) = ""stack""</li>

</ul>

<p>So Stack Exchange could be 堆栈交换.  But I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me it's abbreviated to 堆换 (in which case, it would be the correct word).</p>

"340359","Why is it not easy to find the help center on the mobile versions?","<p><sup>I found other posts that suggest making the help center easier to find but they're quite different. For example, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/304120/348196"">this one</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/315374/348196"">this one</a> are discussing the full version. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/188918/348196"">This one</a> is quite old and was asking for optimizing the help center for the mobile version.</sup></p>

<p>I rarely use the mobile version (I mostly use the mobile app when I'm on mobile) but today I opened the home page of a site on the network (which I hadn't used before) and immediately started looking for its help center; <strong>I spent over a minute trying to find it</strong>. Let's take SuperUser as an example for demonstration purposes<sup>*</sup>:</p>

<p>I looked for it on the top banner(s) but couldn't find it, opened the menu and looked there and still couldn't find it there:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/5X6pK.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5X6pK.png"" alt=""Top banner + menu""></a></p>

<p>Checked if there's another menu on the right and didn't find any. I then had to scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page to look for it there. I did find it there (which is not a good place if it's the only one) but to make matters worse, it's even covered by that notice regarding cookies and TOS so it can easily be missed:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SZvu8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SZvu8.png"" alt=""Bottom of the page""></a></p>

<p>I honestly felt frustrated!</p>

<p>So, my question/suggestion is <strong>why not make it easier to find the help center on the mobile versions by adding it somewhere on the top (or at least in the menu)?</strong> We want to encourage users to go through the help center before posting a question/answer, don't we?</p>

"340658","How exactly does the moderator inactivity process interact with employment at SE and employee moderator rights?","<p>I had previously asked <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/337431/what-is-the-process-regarding-moderator-inactivity-removals"">a question</a> about the procedure for removing moderators who become inactive from moderating their site, and the answer basically boiled down to  this: a moderator has to take at least one moderator action every six months to avoid having their privileges potentially removed for inactivity.</p>

<p>Now, if a moderator gets hired as a Stack Exchange employee (which isn't an uncommon occurrence) and their specific job title entitles them to hold moderator rights across the network, they will (obviously) continue to hold moderator rights on sites where they were previously elected/appointed, regardless of the above inactivity policy, for as long as they're an employee.</p>

<p>Additionally, from what few cases I've seen, once such a moderator ceases their employment, they'll still continue to hold moderator rights on sites they were previously elected/appointed on (unless the site changed phases/graduated in the meantime).</p>

<p>Moderators who get employed by SE often don't continue to moderate their sites while they're an employee - most of their time now gets taken up by their job duties. As such, it's possible that they may not have time to perform at least one moderator action on sites they previously moderated during their time as an SE employee - which would ordinarily lead to them losing their moderator rights under the inactivity policy, the only barrier to that being their staff moderator right entitlement.</p>

<p>Considering these, are former moderators who later become SE employees still expected to take at least one moderator action on sites where they were previously elected/appointed as moderators while they're an employee, to avoid their moderator rights on that site being removed once they cease their employment? Or will they still get to retain their rights, being exempt from the inactivity policy since they were active in their duties as a staff member?</p>

<p>(The inactivity process I linked does mention that an election/appointment has to take place to fill in the gap before the inactivity removal can be carried out, but said election/appointment already takes place shortly after the moderator becomes an employee, so that stage is usually unnecessary once they cease employment.)</p>

"340956","Are migrations allowed if the user is banned on the destination site, but their 6-month limit has opened up?","<p>If a user is banned from asking on a given site, the system <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/102293/block-migration-if-user-is-suspended-question-blocked-at-destination"">will block</a> migrations to that site of questions by the same user posted on different sites.</p>

<p>Additionally, the system <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/question-bans"">allows</a> question-banned users to ask one question on the site every six months, to give them another shot at getting out of the ban.</p>

<p>Putting these pieces of information together, there is one thing that's unclear: if a user is, for example, banned on site A but it's been more than six months since they last asked a question (and so they are temporarily allowed one question), they ask a question on site B, and site B migrates it to site A, will the migration be allowed, since the user is (temporarily) allowed to ask there, or will it still be blocked since the user is banned on site A (regardless of the 6-month allowance)?</p>

<p>The team has stated that migrations are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/234610/377214"">only blocked if they would cause the rate limit to be exceeded</a>, but I'm not sure if it applies to bans (i.e. the 6-month limit), only to the short rate limits that happen in advance of a ban. </p>

"341081","What is the rationale behind RemoveAbandonedQuestions?","<p>There are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5222/572"">a number of reasons why the system will delete posts</a>. One of these reasons is called RemoveAbandonedQuestions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system will automatically delete unlocked, unanswered questions
  older than 365 days on main (non-meta) sites with score of zero (or
  one, if the owner's account is deleted), fewer than 1.5 views per day
  on average, and fewer than two comments. (RemoveAbandonedQuestions)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A question that is open, unlocked, and has a score of zero or one is not a bad question. There are a lot of reasons why it may not have gotten attention, a prime example is that it is an esoteric question.</p>

<p>I recently saw this on Software Engineering - I saw a question a couple of months ago that I bookmarked because I can answer it, but I just haven't had the time. I noticed recently that it was deleted by Community and the RemoveAbandonedQuestion reason is why. At this point in time, the question is only visible to 10k users or moderators, who can cast undelete votes (or, in case of a moderator, just undelete it outright). If I had less than 10k and wasn't a moderator, this question would just be a 404 page for me now.</p>

<p>I understand why closed and/or negatively scored questions get cleaned up by the system. These are ones that the community has determined to not be useful or a good fit. If they haven't been edited and reopened and up-voted or answered with a good answer, it makes sense to get rid of them. However, these ""abandoned"" questions don't seem abandoned - they just seem unanswered and a good answer can help salvage them.</p>

<ul>
<li>notice added</li>
<li>bounty started </li>
<li>notice removed</li>
<li>bounty ended</li>

<p>If however, for whatever reason, something caused the bounty of a question to be returned to the user who started the bounty (as in <a href=""https://drupal.stackexchange.com/posts/288892/timeline"">this example</a>), then only 2 out of 4 of these <em>history</em>-events about such bounty are shown:</p>

<ul>
<li>either the <code>notice added</code> and <code>notice removed</code> related to such bounties should also be removed (or hidden except for moderators),</li>
<li>or the <code>bounty started</code> should also be shown, but then combined with something like <code>bounty returned</code> (instead of ""bounty ended"").</li>

"341519","How to handle a question that was asked in good faith, deleted, and then vandalized while deleted?","<p>A user asked a question on a Stack Exchange site in good faith, but it was a very poor-quality question and ended up getting deleted by the community. Shortly after it was deleted, the asker edited it, replacing it with a rude/abusive screed, which then appeared in the ""Undelete votes"" list. What's the right way to handle this? It can't be ""raise a rude/abusive flag on it"", since you can't raise that flag on something that's already deleted, even if it wasn't deleted for that reason. My best guess would be ""raise a custom mod flag on it"", but that's what I did, and the result was ""declined - flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention"".</p>

"341929","How long should I expect a GDPR data rectification request to take?","<p>Likely in September (2019), through looking at my profile using moderator tools (which I no longer have access to since I resigned as a moderator in early October, and I tried very hard to avoid using any moderator functionality while I was waiting for my resignation to be processed), I noticed that SE has an e-mail address on my account which should not be associated with my account, and which I could not change. I contacted SE using the contact form and asked for this to be changed. In later e-mail communication, I specifically requested on October 8 that someone at SE look at it, and was quite specifically told literally within minutes that it was in the queue for someone to look at.</p>

<p>On October 25 (2019), as the e-mail address had not been changed (I verified this through a data portability request less than half an hour earlier), I submitted a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/legal/gdpr/request"">GDPR data rectification request</a> through the web interface.</p>

<p>On December 4, I submitted another data portability request wherein I noticed (once it finished, which for some reason took a few days) that the change still had not been made. Also on December 4, I sent a follow-up e-mail to privacy-support@stackoverflow.email, as the web interface says to do in case of additional questions, referencing the Oct 25 data rectification request by ID and asking when I could expect it to be honored. I never received a reply to that e-mail.</p>

<p>On December 22, I submitted another data rectification request through the web interface.</p>

<p>As of January 10 (2020), both data rectification requests show as ""Company Approval Requested"". Both are properly confirmed by me (I even have a screenshot of the second data rectification request clearly showing the green ""your request is being reviewed"" popup). I have received no feedback on either.</p>

<h1>TL;DR:</h1>

<p>All that as a preamble to my question: <strong>How long should I expect a GDPR data rectification request to take to process?</strong> Particularly when that rectification request concerns only a single piece of account information?</p>

<p>This is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336713/157730"">Can a GDPR request take up to a month to process?</a> because this question is about data rectification requests, not data portability requests.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange appeared to flourish under the direction of meaningful development guided by community feedback. Community elected moderators were the bridge between the user base at large and the community managers. Those community managers then relayed the feedback we gave to the development teams, who tried their best to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>

<p>All was (relatively) well.</p>

<p>Now, however, it seems as though we're stepping backwards. Leaping backwards, almost.</p>

<p>With the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342039/firing-community-managers-stackexchange-is-not-interested-in-cooperating-with-t"">recent departure of two monumental community managers</a> with next to NO warning, and a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper"">rather disastrous series of events</a>, Stack Exchange is demonstrating to me that transparency is a thing of the past... And I feel absolutely helpless as I watch it fade into the night.</p>

<p>We've tried <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/339050/the-loop-has-arrived-what-does-the-community-think-about-it"">giving feedback</a> on what we would like to see from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/25/introducing-the-loop-a-foundation-in-listening/"">The Loop</a>, which was meant to be a ""foundation in listening.""</p>

<p>Yet I, and I'm sure many others, feel woefully ignored.</p>

<p>We've tried <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334015/an-open-letter-on-the-state-of-curation-and-moderation"">writing open letters</a> from general users, and we've tried <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334575/dear-stack-exchange-a-statement-and-a-letter-from-your-moderators"">writing another letter</a> specifically from community elected moderators - who, with power users, are the pillars of the community.</p>

<p>Yet <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/335868/622284"">the response</a> is not detailed enough to address close to the number of concerns that have been raised.</p>

<p>All of these questions, all of this feedback, and yet I, like many others, are still under the impression that the response is <em>hollow.</em></p>

<p>I want to be useful. I want to contribute meaningfully to the site that has helped me in many times of intellectual need when I was a silent reader. The recent changes have me very worried for the future of the community here.</p>

<p>The question was recently closed as a duplicate of another question asked roughly three years later.</p>

<p>Mine is a simple question that received a simple and satisfactory answer, and I moved on, grateful for the assistance. I question whether there is value in modifying or closing and merging questions such as these that have surely fallen completely off the SEO radar. While the other question certainly has a detailed and well-authored answer, it actually has nothing specifically to do with DotNetNuke; in fact, DotNetNuke does not appear in the question or answer at all. It really does not address my older question directly.</p>

<p>Now, I don't feel passionate about this particular question, and do not intend to contest anything; however, I do care about StackOverflow, and want to ensure my behavior is aligned with the community the next time I dust off the moderator tools for fun. Was this an appropriate closure? Should questions this old and insignificant even be up for closure as duplicates to much newer--albeit still very old--questions? Are specific questions such as this one about DotNetNuke really duplicates of much more generalized questions?</p>

"342302","Remember when Stack Exchange and the Community worked side-by-side to ""make the Internet a better place""? Can we go back to this please?","<p>I've been here for 10+ years now<sup>*</sup>.  Like for a lot of people, Stack Exchange isn't a random website: <em>it's a major chunk of my life</em>.  Years ago, Stack Exchange and the Community worked side-by-side towards a collective goal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Making the internet a better place is the #1 goal of Stack Exchange.</strong><br>
  <sub><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/114026/351283"">Joel Spolsky ♦</a>, 2011</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Good days!</em>  We had an arrangement:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The <em>unpaid</em> communities curated questions and answers, and facilitated <em>expert</em> participation.</strong>  Why do random people on the Internet provide a free service for a private company?  <em>Because we believe in making the Internet a better place</em>.  After all, <strong><em>random people don't mop the dirty floors at McDonald's for free.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>In return for this free service, <em>Stack Exchange provided us with the tools to make the Internet a better place</em>.</strong>  They edited the system to facilitate Q&amp;A curation by the community, allowing <em>everyone</em> to participate through self-moderation.  The provided SEO to attract experts and participants.  They designed new sites for our favorite topics.  They provided a <em>stable platform</em> where we can contribute without being HTML experts, etc.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange ran some profitable services, employees had full-time paid jobs, and everyone was happy that Stack Exchange made enough money to stay afloat.  But above all, <strong>it was a <em>partnership</em></strong>: we were equals, and were in it together.</p>

<p>Importantly, <strong><em>changes were predictable.</em></strong>  We weren't surprised when features were implemented (even the ones we didn't like, e.g. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310061/electronic-opt-out-correcting-miscommunication-and-additional-questions-answer"">mandatory arbitration</a>), because we jointly discussed them first (months, even years in advance).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Q: <em>Can we go back to this please?</em></h2>

<p>Now is the situation is rapidly changing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Stack Exchange are making unilateral decisions</strong>, as if they are the boss in our partnership.  Consequently, community members are left wondering why they're mopping the floor at McDonald's for free.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Changes are now unpredictable</strong>, which leads to uncertainty: we don't even know if <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342145/after-the-recent-cm-departures-are-there-plans-to-shut-down-network-sites-or-ar"">major sites will be shortly shut down</a>.  Thus, even if we continue mopping the floor, it might go to waste.</p></li>
<li><p>We also seem to be overlooking how much effort it was to attract experts in the first place, basically <strong>taking experts for granted now</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think I'm like many people nowadays, I'm...</p>

<p>I truly want to continue helping <em>making the Internet a better place</em>, but with Stack Exchange making unilateral, unpredictable decisions, I'm now uncertain even <a href=""https://chinese.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1656/january-2020-will-chinese-se-shut-down-any-time-soon"">if Chinese.SE will exist tomorrow</a>.  I've simply lost the motivation to mop the floor for free.  I'm not going to rage quit, strike, or anything like that.  Most likely, at some point I'll just unnoticeably stop mopping.</p>

<li>In a separate, Travel SE tab, already open from before I created the Travel SE account, I clicked a question's upvote button</li>

  <p>However, we do use Freshdesk, which has a separate portal with ticket viewing capabilities.

"343568","Privacy Policy Updates (Feb 2020)","<p>We want to share with you that we have updated our Privacy Policy to keep up with the ever evolving data privacy laws and regulations concerning our global community of users and our sites.  We also took the opportunity to review and remove language describing data usage that we currently do not apply, and data usages we have no plans to do in the future as our business evolves.  We want to make sure to limit the scope of data usage included in our Privacy Policy, out of respect for you all and your privacy.</p>

<p>As our business grows, we have created a new policy structure with one foundational, summary Privacy Policy that applies across all our products and services, as well as product-specific sections of our Privacy Policy that describes how our Privacy Policy applies in the context of each of our products. We did this to provide greater transparency about what we do with your data when interacting with each of our products.  We plan to keep this framework going forward for consistency and clarity.  We also changed and added language within the Privacy Policy to be more clear and specific about how your data is used.</p>

<p>High level summary of the changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>We’ve restructured the <a href=""/legal/privacy-policy"">privacy policy pages</a> so that the language is clearer and more transparent</li>
<li>There is a supplemental “Privacy Policy Notice” for each product area: <a href=""/legal/privacy-policy/public-network"">Public Network</a>, <a href=""/legal/privacy-policy/talent"">Talent &amp; Jobs</a>, and Teams: <a href=""/legal/privacy-policy/teams-basic"">Basic</a>, <a href=""/legal/privacy-policy/teams-business"">Business</a>, and <a href=""/legal/privacy-policy/teams-enterprise"">Enterprise</a>.</li>
<li>We’ve removed descriptions of data usage that no longer apply to our products and which we found we never applied to your data. </li>
<li>We’ve updated the language to comply with evolving data privacy laws and requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our legal, community, product, and engineering teams worked diligently to make sure the new language and structure create clear, understandable policies.  Going forward, we will not maintain the “Plain English” version of our Privacy Policy, to avoid trying to interpret policy for you all.  That was never our intent with previous “Plain English” narratives, but the expanding and evolving set of privacy laws across countries and states only makes this that much more difficult.</p>

<p>As always, you have control over the data you share on our platform. As a reminder, you can <a href=""/users/edit/current"">view and update your profile settings here</a> and <a href=""/users/email/settings/current"">control email preferences here</a>.</p>

"343617","Why prefer to restrict questions instead of restricting answers?","<p>I read a lot more SE sites than I'm a contributor to, but something I've slowly noticed is that there is a tendency to prefer making rules about questions rather than making rules about answers, even when there is a clear benefit (in my mind anyway) to the latter. I'm wondering why.</p>

<p>An example: a lot of the sites have rules to close questions that ask for legal advice. This makes a lot of sense! However a big topic of discussion on some of those sites is whether specific questions are valid and how to decide if a question is too similar to a request for legal advice (e.g., <a href=""https://academia.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1340/on-topic-ness-of-questions-on-legal-issues-related-to-academia"">this question on Academia.SE</a> that opens with ""<code>We seem to have a very inconsistent policy with respect to questions on legal issues related to academia.</code>"").</p>

<p>Interestingly, all the sites with these policies that I've come across (academia, workplace, and freelancing come to mind) consistently put the onus of correctly interpreting their legal-advice rules on the asker of the question, who is far far more likely to have little or no experience with the community that wrote the rules than the answerer. This topic in particular is tricky because, in order to understand what constitutes a question on legal advice, you generally have to <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2423/"">read</a> <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/581/defining-the-on-topic-off-topic-line-on-questions-that-could-be-answered-by-a?rq=1"">some</a> <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1856/what-is-asking-for-legal-advice"">trail</a> of <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1983/what-is-legal-advice"">long</a> <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/29/are-employment-law-questions-off-topic"">discussions</a> <a href=""https://academia.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3497/should-legal-questions-be-closed-as-too-narrow?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">buried</a> in the <a href=""https://academia.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2141/has-the-stance-on-questions-pertaining-to-legal-issues-changed?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">meta</a> <a href=""https://freelancing.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14/should-law-specific-questions-be-encouraged/15?r=SearchResults&amp;s=4|6.4012#15"">site</a>. Why don't sites instead state that <em>answers</em> giving legal advice beyond ""get a lawyer"" are out-of-scope?</p>

<p>Obviously this only applies to some rules, but I'm wondering why we so favor rules about questions over rules about answers, even while the site <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27825/"">struggles</a> to be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/168685/"">welcoming</a> to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/179003/"">new</a> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9953/could-we-please-be-a-bit-nicer-to-new-users"">users</a>. Duplicate question and off-topic rules are easy examples of good question-based rules. Questions that are overly-broad are another. Questions whose answers are primarily opinion-based I think is somewhere in the middle. Why not have answers that are opinion-based be out-of-scope? In my experience, some of the most valuable sets of answers on SE can be found attached to questions that boil down to ""Something happened; what would you do if you were me?""</p>

<p>(Apologies if this is a duplicate! I couldn't figure out what search terms to use, but also I feel like this has probably been discussed before.)</p>

"343911","Add a community feedback step before implementing policy or process changes","<p>In a recent <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/343890/336163"">post</a>, Teresa Dietrich announced this process for policy changes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have defined a standard process for new policy or process review that includes Community Managers, employees who are long-time community members, and Moderators before being shared and put into place. Our plan is to provide new policies to the planned Moderator Council for feedback periods before they are made official. We will then share it with all Moderators through the Stack Moderators Team for advance notification. We value the deep understanding that moderators on the network have of their communities and users, and welcome honest, respectful feedback from the greater Stack Exchange Community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the complaints that I have heard most frequently in the past few months is that users find out about policy changes only <em>after</em> the discussion and debate have been completed in secret, without them. The above process seems to indicate that this will continue - that moderators are the only ones who will receive advance notice of proposed changes and be allowed the opportunity to provide feedback <em>before</em> a final decision is made.</p>

<p>Let's add a community feedback stage. After feedback has been received from moderators, the proposed change should be posted on Meta or another suitable place for community feedback. To be clear, I'm not asking for the community to be given absolute veto power over a change, but only asking for advance notice <em>and an opportunity to be heard</em> before a final decision is made.</p>

<p>I do not complain about it.</p>

<p>Purpose of this post is to fill the bug.</p>

<p>The problem is that I knew about getting yellow card wrong way.
I became aware of it only when I manually directed browser to review queues page <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/review"">https://stackoverflow.com/review</a> .</p>

<p>StackOverflow usually invites you to participate in review by displaying red dot on review queues icon.
In my case I saw red dot and when I pressed review queues icon I saw message ""There are no review queues available to you"" (without any clickable URLs).
Well, it could be that queue got cleared before I clicked icon or some glitch.</p>

<p>But when I saw it appear again and again with the same message and without any URLs I wondered what could be the case and visited reviews page by directly specifying URL in browser.</p>

<p>Red dot disappeared once I visited review page and saw the warning so it is OK.</p>

<p>The problem is that red dot appears with no actionable URLs or explanation so user has no chances to know that something strange happens.</p>

<p>It would be nice to add some clickable item under message ""There are no review queues available to you"" or make this message clickable so user could see what is going on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are making fundamental changes to how our close question system works so that it’s a friendlier experience and more educational for post authors, while making it easier to edit and reopen closed questions, and reduce the burden on curators. Questions that get voted to be closed will be hidden, giving authors the opportunity to improve their questions in private.</p>

<li>Where will the question go? Will it simply be banished from the first page, or will it completely disappear?</li>
<li>Will high-rep users still be able to see hidden posts?</li>
<li>Will the question be hidden on the <strong>first</strong> vote, or the <strong>last</strong> vote?</li>
<li>Will I get a notification to improve my post if it has been hidden?</li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate this may not be completely set in stone yet, but it would be interesting to know the current opinions from Stackexchange on the implementation.</p>

Sometimes this is desirable, but sometimes it comes across as weird. Here are some examples I've run into, with the removed words shown in strike-through.</p>

<ul>
<li><s>C# (pronounced ""see sharp"") is</s> a high level, statically typed, multi-paradigm programming</li>
<li><s>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is </s> the standard markup language</li>
<li><s>This tag</s> should be used only on questions that are about Objective-C features</li>
<li><s>DO NOT use this tag</s> unless you are addressing Apple's iPhone and/or iPod touch specifically</li>
<li><s>Use this tag</s> (along with an appropriate programming-language tag) for programming questions relating to the Apache HTTP</li>

However the international Stack Overflow sites appear to have translated badge names as well (at least Spanish and Portuguese do).

Could we have our badges translated if we agreed on our meta that we wanted that?</p>

<p>In my opinion it would be more helpful to have a single StackExchange site like <em>cryptocurrency.stackexchange.com</em> with different tags for different cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, etc.)</p>

<hr>

<h3>Current state</h3>

<p>Let's take programming languages as an example. When using the same structure as currently used for cryptocurrencies we would have a single stackexchange site for each programming language (e.g. <em>java.stackexchange.com</em>, <em>python.stackexchange.com</em>) but instead we have a single site <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com"">https://stackoverflow.com</a> where all programming questions are asked with different tags for different languages.</p>

<h3>New cryptocurrency/programming language</h3>

<p>For new languages we only need a new tag and users can start asking questions for this specific programming languages. For cryptocurrencies instead you need to wait for a new stackexchange site, which may, for small cryptocurrencies, never appear. If there was a single site for all cryptocurrencies though, you could just ask that questions under a new tag.</p>

<h3>General questions</h3>

<p>And what about questions regarding cryptocurrencies (or programming) in general? On Stackoverflow we can simply ask those questions by not using language- but topic-specific tags. For cryptocurrencies you would <em>?probably?</em> have to post them under <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com"">https://crypto.stackexchange.com</a> using the <code>crypocurreny</code> tag, which is, in my opinion, weird and not good structured, also because there are a lot of different topics regarding cryptocurrencies which currently can't be differentiated because there is only one tag <code>cryptocurreny</code> available.</p>

They rarely post spam (probably because they get blocked by the system) and if they do post spam content they are sometimes nuked by mods.

<p>It would not be very difficult to write an automated bot to watch these accounts and catch any content as soon as it is posted.

<p>I am posting here to give a place for the Meta Community to discuss this blog post as we feel that discussion belongs here (and not in the comments of the blog). </p>

<p>The goal here is to be more open (and vulnerable) than we have been in the past relating to a tough subject, and in so doing try to move forward together. That said, we know that this is a painful subject for many, and we realize that Sara’s post here does not talk about every aspect of things that happened and every way that folks were affected.</p>

<p>I put 2 times a flag on a given answer 'disturbing' me. The first time a moderator reacted very fast removing remarks associated to the answer and editing the answer itself.

<p>Of course I cannot know the reason of that delay, I know nothing about the hidden flag management, I do not know if the moderators are 'playing the watch' and the 'rotting of the flag', but that does not suit me, I have not raised two times a flag on this answer for nothing. </p>

  <li>Is the question only fully answerable by an employee?</li>

<p>In my opinion, even though the score may not be +30, it still <em>looks</em> like it has community support. However, the moderator handling the flag didn't think it was enough to <em>look</em> like it had community support.</p>

<p>So that begs the question: exactly how much support/votes is required for a feature request to meet the ""looks like it has community support"" criterion? +7 is clearly not enough. Must the question reach +30 in a day in order to meet it?</p>

<p>The link goes to the ""Propose Tag Info"" page for that particular tag. On Music Fans Meta, the colour scheme is such that <a href=""https://musicfans.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/topic-challenge"">the link is barely visible</a>, for instance:</p>

<p>There, the link on ""help us create it"" has practically the same colour as the rest of the text. I have been editing the tag info for several tags on Music Fans Meta for quite a while and only now realised that there was a link directly to the edit page sitting there. Instead I've been navigating via ""Learn More. . ."" followed by ""Propose Tag Info"" every single time.</p>

<p>I presume that the current colour scheme is uniform across all Beta Meta sites. So, can the colour scheme for links on Beta Meta be changed so that they are more visible? This isn't the only link on Music Fans Meta, so I actually have no idea how many other useful links I may have missed.</p>

The problem is, there's no way to convince people <em>now</em> of anything any former employee said because there's no way to indicate they were staff when they said them.</p>

<p>This helps in future discussions, as people can trust that people aren't simply quoting random people and pretending they had any say in how SO ran.</p>

The threshold number is fairly low within a given amount of time (the exact mechanics are kept secret). When the system detects this pattern, all of the votes cast from that user to the user affected are reversed, and a ""voting corrected"" event is added to the affected user's reputation history to indicate what has occurred.</p>

"348103","Lazy loading our leaderboard ads","<p>The Advertising team is continuously making improvements to the ads experience on our sites for both our users as our clients. One of the changes we’re excited about sharing is the implementation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lazy Loading</a> of our Midpage Leaderboard ads (the 728x90px banners between answers). </p>

<p>In the last months, we’ve been testing ways that could help us improve the banner ad performance for clients while maintaining the user experience for our Community. When working through the different options, we wanted to make sure that there is a maximum of 3 ads (1 job ad and 2 banner ads) in-view in virtually all cases. How many ads you actually see depends on several factors including whether or not we have sold ads for the particular page. </p>

<p>We’ve found that implementing Lazy Loading on our midpage leaderboard ads improves the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewable_Impression"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">viewability</a> by 20-25%, but it did decrease our total number of available impressions. To offset the loss of impressions that this causes and to make sure that we can fulfill the demand of our clients, we’ve decided to include a 2nd Midpage Leaderboard between answers 3 and 4 whenever these are available. </p>

<p>We’re currently graduating this and are releasing it network-wide this week. As mentioned above, this change will maintain the maximum number of ads in-view at 3, which should avoid significant impacts on your experience. However, if you see any ads that you feel are problematic, feel free to report them using our Report This Ad <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/345476/report-this-ad-feature"">feature</a>.</p>

I've seen two major types of questions where this tends to happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Identify this"" questions - Once an answer is accepted and/or a consensus is reached (depending on site standards), it could make sense to add a tag associated with the answer.

<li>Problem-solving or debugging questions where the type of problem is not evident from the problem description.

"348237","Historically-locked questions aren't merely ""currently"" not accepting new answers or interactions","<p>Most manual locks applied to posts, such as content dispute or comment-only locks, are meant to just be temporary, and lifted at an appropriate time. As such, the part of the post notice that says ""it is not currently accepting new [answers or] interactions"" makes sense.</p>

<p>However, <em>historical</em> locks on questions are meant to be <em>permanent</em>. Generally, historical locks are <em>not</em> lifted intentionally unless the lock is determined to be in error. Per the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126587/what-is-a-historical-lock-and-what-is-it-used-for"">historical lock FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A historical lock is a mechanism by which moderators can mark posts as <strong>historical artifacts</strong>. [...] [It] is often the <strong>final</strong> state of a question that has been deleted and undeleted more than once, or subject to a close or delete war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post notice for historical locks, though, says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question and its answers are locked because the question is off-topic but has historical significance. It is <strong>not currently</strong> accepting new answers or interactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part of the notice implies that new answers or interactions may potentially be accepted in the future. This is usually true for posts locked as content disputes or other ""temporary"" lock reasons, but is usually <em>not</em> true for questions locked as historical significance. Therefore, for historical locks, the notice should instead read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question and its answers are locked because the question is off-topic but has historical significance. It is <strong>no longer</strong> accepting new answers or interactions.</p>
</blockquote>

I want to ask a question asking for advice finding a good design to build a wooden bike jump off of. The two best options that I can think of would be (pun intended) Woodworking and Bicycles SE. Is there a better option that I missed? Which of the two is more fit for that type of question? </p>

As I would like to understand what I'm hearing to the best of my ability as an English-only speaker, it would be very convenient if I didn't have to propose a new site on Area 51 every time I'm confused about a lyric. Unfortunately, it looks like SE prefers sites for individual languages as opposed to groups of languages, and Google Translate is not a native Swede, nor does it translate Sognamål.</p>

<p>Where can I ask this kind of question so that native speakers and cultural experts will see it?</p>

"348338","Do well-voted and detailed answers signal for well asked questions?","<p>It is known that in professional sites like StackExchange - subsites users take question very seriously.<br>
A good question is a mix of all sorts of things such as making the users think, research, and at the end post their own unique answer.  </p>

<p>So, we probably won't see a lot of cases of good answers posted on bad phrased questions.<br>
But that is just thinking logically, the numbers tell things are pretty different..  </p>

<p>I've seen many many questions (Especially on Stackoverflow) that caught the attention of well-known users (With a lot of reputation) who were kind enough to answer those question in a very finely, detailed and precised way.  </p>

<p>While they get many upvotes, the question itself stays the same - quiet and lonely. Which made me think of two reasons:<br>
1) People tend to upvote well known users, somewhat of a 'Herd behavior'<br>
2) People tend to understand only the important parts of the question itself, but take more time to read the answers, and thus appreciate more.  </p>

<p>I am not sure if those are correct, I am not sure at all. I would like to hear your ideas from your personal use of those sites (such as, StackOverflow Mathematics etc..)</p>

<p>Adding a banner to the top of the mobile site will encourage users who still use it to migrate to the responsive site, since the mobile site is being phased out.

<p>According to the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19753/313042"">FAQ</a>, tags that are not associated to any questions (""zombie tags"") are automatically deleted by a script that runs daily. So, why have these two tags survived this long?</p>

<p>I'll note that there don't appear to be any synonyms linked to either of these two tags. It is known that if a tag is a synonym of a master tag that is cleaned up for lack of any associated questions, then only the master tag is removed while the synonym remains behind (see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/317928/313042"">this bug report</a>). The <a href=""/questions/tagged/gaming-se"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;gaming-se&#39;"" rel=""tag"">gaming-se</a> tag here on Meta SE is an example of such a tag, since it is synonymized with <a href=""/questions/tagged/arqade"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;arqade&#39;"" rel=""tag"">arqade</a>, a tag that is now removed.</p>

<p>But, the situation with [canned-comments] and [impact] seems to be different. Surely the daily tag cleanup script runs on Meta SE as well, so how have these two tags survived (and can we delete them)?</p>

However, the blog post also announced another change to votes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Item the second: <strong>after casting 300 votes, you cannot downvote non community wiki posts at more than a 2:1 ratio</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't seem like this rule still exists, though, as <a href=""https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1247892"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this query</a> shows that there are a large number of users who've cast 300 or more votes, with downvote to upvote ratios <em>much</em> higher than 2:1. In particular, the first user in the list has downvoted 20,403 posts while having only upvoted two posts, and has registered their account long after the blog post was published. I <em>highly doubt</em> that their ratio, and those of others in the list, were caused by downvoting almost-exclusively community wiki posts.</p>
<p>Searching through the blog and through meta posts, there doesn't appear to be any announcement that this rule was removed.</p>
<p>Was this rule never implemented? If it was implemented, when and why was it removed?</p>

In this post, I attempt to define the term “Community” as it is used on our Public Platform. My overall suggestion can be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Community</strong> refers to all Public Platform users (on Stack Overflow, or any other site on the Stack Exchange Network) who have contributed content (in good faith) to any of the sites on the network (questions, answers, comments, votes), or who have assisted with the curation of content on the sites (editing, flagging, reviewing, moderating). And each site maintains its own smaller Community along these lines, which while being interconnected with the large Community, has its own specific identity as well.</li>
<li>Passive users who visit sites on the network without engaging in any of the activities defined above for the Community are not yet part of the Community, but are part of our audience. They are essential to Stack Overflow’s mission, future, and growth.</li>
<li>Our Public Platform strategy and vision aspires to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong> on providing features that meet the needs of both of these main types of users (each of which has various sub-types with their own needs).</li>
<li><strong>Recognize</strong> that the needs of these different main groups (community vs audience) can be vastly different (as are those of many different subgroups), and that we must be mindful of these differences if we are to address them successfully.</li>
<li><strong>Provide</strong> features and foster an atmosphere that encourages and incentivizes passive users to become Community members, and less active Community members to become more active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

"349595","Code formatting error message dispenses no-longer-true advice, and doesn't indicate what to do in case of false positives","<p>On four sites in the network, there is a code formatting filter that checks for users pasting in code but not formatting it correctly. When it is triggered, it says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your post appears to contain code that is not properly formatted as code. Please indent all code by 4 spaces using the code toolbar button or the CTRL+K keyboard shortcut. For more editing help, click the [?] toolbar button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple problems with this message, as is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The &quot;[?]&quot; button referred to in the message no longer exists - the button now instead has a text name, &quot;Show formatting tips&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four-space indent is no longer the preferred way to format code by hand, as the code formatting help (referred to in the above button) no longer lists it, instead listing the code fence (```) method. This method is also easier for users, as they don't have to indent every line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it doesn't indicate what to do in case of a false positive indication - across this site, there are several people asking about cases where they didn't enter any code but the filter still doesn't let them submit their post. (It's not a warning - it blocks submission entirely if it's hit.) In many of those cases, it is indeed a valid false positive: there were <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/191983/code-that-is-not-properly-formatted-as-code-false-positive"">a</a> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/254269/your-post-appears-to-contain-code-that-is-not-properly-formatted-as-code-again"">few</a> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130736/bug-in-your-post-appears-to-contain-code-that-is-not-properly-formatted-as-code"">cases</a> where the thing being mistakenly recognized as code was actually valid Markdown, and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/349588/how-to-avoid-the-not-properly-formatted-as-code-alert"">one recent case</a> where it was recognizing valid MathJax as code (in this last case, fixing it isn't as simple as changing the Markdown style: the MathJax is fundamental to the post).</p>

"349600","Provide a proper way to indicate error messages that is visually distinct from quotes and actual code","<p>Error messages are a fairly common thing to mention, in both questions and answers, across many Stack Exchange communities. I think it would be valuable to have a markdown syntax to denote error messages in a manner that is visually distinct from the other offerings. I am fully aware of the current options to use either a blockquote (i.e. <code>&gt;</code> syntax) or generic code block (i.e. either <code>```</code> with no specified language, or indented with <code>&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;</code> ), and have been using both for 9 years now. Still, I believe that these two approaches are just work-arounds, making the best of what is available because what is ideal is not available.</p>
<p>Error messages are not quotes. I quote documentation, books, articles, people, and sometimes output / results fit well-enough into this.</p>
<p>Error messages are not code. I think we all agree on this, and so a generic / non-highlighted code block is often the reasonable approach as the fixed / monospace font plus preservation of whitespace lends itself well to this purpose. BUT, while this might be a better option than the blockquote, a generic code block should be for code that doesn't have a syntax highlighter, command-lines, occasionally output / results, etc.</p>
<p>Error messages are something else and should stand out. They are even handled separately at the OS / shell / code  level (i.e. <code>stdout</code> vs <code>stderr</code>). A code block would suffice as long as it was obviously different than other code blocks. Perhaps all text in red and/or a red border? And maybe the syntax could be something like:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>``` error
Msg 50505, State 10, Level 42
A horse is a horse,
of course of course

"349668","Is there enough info in the system to deal with serial unupvotes enabled by automatic edits?","<p>It's <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348746/were-switching-to-commonmark"">yet another time</a> when we're having posts massively edited by automated scripts.</p>
<p>When a user upvotes or downvotes a post, their vote gets locked in after five minutes, and is only unlocked if/when the post is edited. This is a defense against <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/70853/what-is-the-justification-for-locking-votes"">gaming the system</a>, which can happen in various ways.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that when posts are massively edited by automated scripts, all those votes on those posts that were previously locked are now all unlocked, and this means that <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/315072/how-does-vote-lock-work-can-someone-unupvote-answers-that-are-older-than-4-ye"">an unscrupulous user can serially unupvote another user</a>, i.e. remove all their past upvotes toward another user. The point of unlocking votes upon posts being edited is so that people can remove their vote if an edit changes the post's character; these automated script edits do <em>not</em> change a post's character. (This isn't a made-up situation; the link above is an actual documented case of that happening, with the prior mass edit from HTTP to HTTPS links.)</p>
<p>It's been stated that serial unvoting <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/199952/377214"">does constitute voting abuse, just like serial <em>voting</em></a>, but this case isn't handled by the voting fraud reversal scripts, and so cases of it have to be manually flagged.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, though, when a vote is removed, all information related to the vote is also removed, and it's no longer able to easily tell whether someone had previously cast a vote on a given post simply by looking at the post record.</p>
<p>In response to the prior incident of serial unvoting, I filed <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/315150/votes-should-not-be-unlocked-if-the-community-user-makes-an-automated-script-edi"">a feature request</a> to not unlock votes on automated script edits, but it was negatively received, with the top answer stating that such cases should be dealt with by individual case instead.</p>
<p>My question is: is there enough information in the system that staff can use to identify and possibly sanction users who conduct targeted unvoting, in this manner? In other words, if someone reports a case of targeted unvoting (possibly as a result of this recent automated script edit), can that report properly be actioned? Second, will Stack Exchange be able to restore the votes in case someone is serially unvoted?</p>

Now, the approver has no way to know that a change was made and that they approved a different version of the suggested edit.

<blockquote>
<p>Are people clicking on this tag to look at the corresponding collection of questions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence...</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a way to find out the number of tag-page views?</p>
<p>I feel like this would be a useful data point when deciding whether or not to burninate a tag: if people are clicking on the tag to browse those questions, it's a sign it's worth keeping.  If nobody ever looks, I feel there's probably not a big distinction between it existing or not existing.</p>
<p>I understand I can go into a page <a href=""https://chinese.stackexchange.com/tags/translation/topusers"">such as this</a>, and it gives some question/answer statistics.  But I get the feeling sometimes people tag questions with certain tags only because (a) they have to choose some tags, (b) they happen to think of some random word at the time of writing, not because the tag is actually useful.  And having these non-useful, yet extant tags inhibits proper tagging.</p>

<p>Eventually, it allowed to continue after I tried it in a new window. I don't know the technical aspects of how captcha works, but why is this happening? Is it because of some server error, that this thing happens every time, or is there something else?</p>
<p>Also, the captcha looks pretty outdated. Again, I got no clue on how AI or scripts work, but it seems that a script can be well-equipped to tick a box. So, why don't we get something more advanced and efficient: like the ones where you have to select a letter or tick some images with certain objects in it? Why cant we improve captcha, both error free versions and more challenging ones?</p>

In particular, comment-style language hints may eventually stop working. So instead of using 4-space indentation to format code blocks, we are to use code fences.</p>
<p>But then, shouldn't the automated tools &quot;lead by example&quot; and use code fences too?</p>
<p>Currently we have the following explanation under the <strong>Code</strong> section of formatting tips:</p>

"350905","If a user copies content from another SO post into his own post verbatim, is the attribution required according to the license?","<p>Backstory:</p>
<p>We recently had a situation on ru.SO, where a new user had posted 22 answers in 2 hours, 17 of which were copy-pasted from comments under the corresponding questions. Most of them were copied verbatim, none of the answers were made 'community wiki', and no attribution was provided.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the mod team decided to not do anything about it, and our meta community <a href=""https://ru.meta.stackoverflow.com/q/10628/215103"">doesn't seem to have a clear consensus</a> if something needs to be done or not.</p>
<p>But this is not what this question is about.</p>
<hr />
<p>This sparked a discussion. Does copying another user's comment into an answer require attribution, as per CC BY-SA?</p>
<p>More broadly, if you copy content made by another user <em>into your own post on SO</em> (as opposed to posting it on an unrelated site), do you have to provide attribution or not?</p>

"350917","Cannot collapse a revision preview while a rate limit message is visible","<p>In the profile activity page, I opened a revision preview from a list of my own revisions by clicking on the edit summary, as that allows you to drop open the revision itself in its inline view.</p>
<p>I then tried to open another revision preview, and was stopped from loading it because you cannot load more than one revision per second (which is by design and functions properly.)</p>
<p>With this message still visible, I opened the revision preview (after waiting the designated amount of time,) then went to close it not long afterwords. The preview arrow that indicates whether a revision is shown or collapsed indicated that it was collapsed, but the revision itself does not collapse. The error message is closed, but the revision doesn't hide until I click to reopen it, and then close it again.</p>
<p>My explanation is pretty wordy, so here's a .gif demonstrating this.</p>

<p>The central (main) column is for (editing/viewing) (Q/A).</p>
<p>I found at least 2 cases where the limited width of this column leads to inconvenient visualization.
These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When viewing a wide code block.
One has to scroll to the left then.
This is even more inconvenient when the code block is also high. Scrolling left/right also may require sliding back and forth the Windows right scroll bar just to access the horizontal scroll bar, and then going back to the lines one was reading.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When editing code.
For indented text in code blocks (when using 4 spaces instead of ```, even more needed for itemized lists), having overflowing lines makes reading inconvenient.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is it possible to give SE the option to collapse the left and right columns, so the width of the central column increases?</strong>
There will always be cases which are not covered (depending on the size of the code blocks, and other possible situations), but this suggestion would at least eliminate the problem in many of these cases.</p>

"351151","Why are current user suspensions visible to other users?","<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/23385/643262"">This question from 2009</a> raised the concern of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Streisand effect</a> happening with suspensions on Stack Exchange. When a user is suspended, other users will see it and wonder about the reason. The lack of information will lead to other users speculating about what happened, and this speculation might lead to resentment, or to the creation of wild theories that do not correspond to reality.</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/293213/643262"">This question</a> explains in great detail why SE does not keep public records of <em>past</em> suspensions. Keeping all information on previous suspensions private allows previously suspended users to rehabilitate and come back into the system with a clean slate, if they wish to do so. The question also explains that moderators are not allowed to share details about current suspensions publicly, as the suspended user would not be able to explain their side of the story.</p>
<p>But none of those questions explain why the fact that a user is <em>currently</em> suspended is shown publicly. From <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/23385/643262"">the first question</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's generally quite easy to notice when a user gets thrown in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/06/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/"">The Penalty Box</a>. You see the tell-tale <strong>1</strong> when viewing questions they've asked or answers they've provided. You visit their profile page. You see that big red message. And you're curious...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is taken as a premise in that question: the reasons are not explained. It seems to me that a solution to both problems would be not to let users know when a user is currently suspended. This would mean showing their reputation as it was before the suspension, and not displaying any message on their profile page stating that the user is suspended. We all know that anything that is on the Internet at some point, may well be on the Internet for a long time. So if we really want no public record of past suspensions, it is best not to have a public record of current suspensions either.</p>
<p>Especially for one-week suspensions, in most cases this would be indistinguishable from a week of vacation, or a busy week away from SE. Maybe for longer suspensions it would make more sense to prevent the Streisand effect by displaying the suspension and short reason publicly, as in this case users are probably going to notice anyway.</p>
<p>I could not find any answer to this on Meta Stack Exchange, but maybe I did not search for the right terms. So my question is: <strong>why are current suspensions visible to the public?</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>From the same link, there is one case in which the Community User appears as the sole reviewer, namely when there is a clash of editing between a user with privileges and one without privileges. But, in that case the Community User will reject the edit, not approve. Furthermore, I suggested my edit on the [login] tag's info at 2020-07-30 14:19:10Z and the edit on the wiki was approved by the Community User at 2020-07-30 14:42:59Z, which is late enough. I'm also pretty sure that no other edit was going on at that time.</p>
<p>This also does not seem to be a case of the Community User taking credit for a deleted user's review, as mentioned in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/184992"">Why does the Community user approve and reject edits?</a>. This is because <a href=""https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/1346/3"">this edit</a> made by Tsundoku on the [login] tag's wiki has the same timestamp as the approval by the Community User. Definitely no other user, deleted or otherwise, was involved in this process.</p>
<p>Could someone explain how it happened that the Community User was the sole approver on my suggested edit on a tag wiki? I took Tsundoku's help in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1037/conversation/experimenting-with-tag-wiki-suggested-edits"">chat</a> to try and play with the various options that are visible on a tag's info page for approving a suggested edit; however, we couldn't come to any fruitful conclusion.</p>

<p>The question was IMO clear enough. <em>The one request for source code to a &quot;hello world&quot; program was rather pointless given the problem faced.</em>  Yet two people voted the question closed as &quot;unclear&quot;.</p>
<p>I then found a question / answer I thought might be effectively the same question asked a different way and voted duplicate... the question closed immediately as &quot;unclear&quot;.</p>
<p>The only problem is I <strong>did not</strong> vote the question unclear and absolutely disagree with that.  I'm a bit uncomfortable with my one vote being used to close this as duplicate either, I like the safety net of multiple votes being required.  Voting duplicate is tricky and very error prone and it is surely good to let second opinions be cast on this.</p>
<p>I can see why other close votes are cumulative.  These all easily overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs more focus</li>
<li>Needs more clarity</li>
<li>Opinion based</li>
</ul>
<p>I really can't reconcile the idea that a question is both unclear and <em>clearly</em> a duplicate.  Indeed it's hard for duplicates to be opinion based either since the other question would also have been opinion based and should have been closed.</p>
<p>Why do duplicate votes count as regular &quot;close&quot; votes?  Could this group of votes (only) be maintained as a separate count, with separate trigger to close actually, rather than a cumulative trigger between them.</p>
<p>Note this is a different feature request to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/54917/distinguish-close-votes-by-reason"">this one</a>.

privilege; 4k on beta sites), can vote to delete closed questions
within 48 hours of being closed, so long as they score −3 or lower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This information from the FAQ appears to be correct, in that I am aware of a question that was deleted within about an hour of closure.</p>
<p>I accept that the help page might not be the place to go into full detail, but even so, it should not be misleading, and <em>&quot;cannot be deleted&quot;</em> is evidently an over-simplification (as clearly they <em>can</em>, under certain circumstances).  Would it make sense to amend it to a slightly more nuanced version, such as <em>&quot;cannot be deleted except by trusted users&quot;</em>?  Even just <em>&quot;cannot usually be deleted&quot;</em> could work if the aim is to be as concise as possible -- but it needs <strong>something</strong> to alert the reader to the fact that <em>&quot;cannot be deleted&quot;</em> is not the whole story.</p>

<p><em>(By the way, the question which I know was indeed deleted within a short time of closure is one that I had answered, so it is still visible to me via my deleted answers, along with the approximate timings of closure and deletion.

I was going to ask &quot;has this ever been relevant outside of SO&quot;, but let me ask a slightly broader question:</p>
<h2>which mod elections, outside of SO, have had the most candidates?</h2>
<p>Obviously I could trawl through all sites' <code>/election</code> pages to find this information, but maybe someone knows an easier way (or has already collected the data).</p>

I also can’t try tabbing to it and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, because it’s a regular <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with no <code>tabindex</code> attribute, so it’s not tabbable and not an interactive element.

<p>An obvious possible <a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a> would be to unify all Imgur upload dialogs to the way they appear on questions and answers, as an <code>inline-dialog</code>.
But for the profile picture uploader, this dialog doesn’t have an obvious alternative, so in this instance, it’s necessary to redesign the close button so that it acts as a normal button (interactive element, tabbable) and closes the modal popup.</p>

I created a chatroom (in &quot;Gallery&quot; mode), and under the &quot;Access&quot; tab is a section labelled &quot;Explicit write access&quot;, which says:</p>

<p>Even when this room is read-only or their reputation is too low, these users will be able to talk in this room.</p>

<p>Which sounds like exactly what I want, because the user asking the question has a reputation of 5. Unfortunately, if I try to grant the user write access to the room, I get the &quot;Users must have at least 20 reputation to talk&quot; error.</p>
<p>...which I knew, and is why I'm trying to grant explicit write access because &quot;their reputation is too low&quot;.</p>
<p>Is there no way to have a conversation with a low-reputation user outside of comments?</p>

<p>On a Mac in Firefox 80.0.1, when I scroll the similar questions pane, the initial text visible in the pane doesn't scroll; the questions scroll under it. If I leave the page (like to post this question on Meta) and return, it resolves itself until new content is added to the pane when I continue typing a title. I initially noticed it on another site, but was able to reproduce it here on Meta as I was typing this question.</p>
<p>I've tried shifting the focus between the body, title and the similar questions pane, but the only thing that has worked to &quot;fix&quot; it is to leave the page and come back. It seems like some event handler is missing a step?</p>

"354053","What's up with the new way of categorizing flags?","<p><em>I know this is something that's been implemented a few months ago, but I never had the time to seriously look at it, and actually post something on Meta.</em></p>
<p><strong>I'm completely lost with the way the flags have been categorized</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are the most frustrating things I encounter :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The flag for &quot;Blatantly off-topic&quot; is located under &quot;Need improvement &gt; A community-specific reason&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only being <em>blatantly</em> off-topic isn't something frowned upon <strong>specifically</strong> on SO, it is also a question that doesn't need improvement. It's completely out of scope, it doesn't belong on SO. One can improve a thousand times a question about the way they should bake their cake, it won't make it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The flag &quot;This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network&quot; is also located under &quot;Need improvement &gt; A community-specific reason&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, the question doesn't need improvement, it just needs to be moved elsewhere. It might even be very well formatted, respecting every single guideline for SuperUser, with a MCVE, that deserves to end up in the Hot tab. But it's not supposed to be here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The flag &quot;Needs more focus&quot; is at the top-level</p>
<ul>
<li>The guidelines as to know why a question is out of scope is a community-specific matter. Why isn't that flag located under &quot;A community-specific reason&quot; ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The flag &quot;Duplicate&quot; exists twice. At the top-level and under &quot;Needs improvement&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now, when looking for a specific flag, I'm basically <em>bruteforcing</em> every entry to finally find the one that reflects the reason I'm looking for.</p>
<p>I don't know if I got obscenely used to the old way of categorizing the flags, but the new one has been confusing me more than it should. I just <strong>cannot get used to it</strong>.</p>

"354255","Review badges, we need more of them!","<p>In the past a lot of people have argued to get rid of review badges all together. For example <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/216667/361484"">here</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/187351/abandon-the-review-grind-badges"">here</a>.</p>
<p>To an extent these questions are a bit old, and are based on different mechanics of the review system. But still, there are people that feel we shouldn't have badges for reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing is important</strong><br>
There are a lot of posts, especially on bigger sites that hardly get any attention, and the only viable option of the subpar ones getting closed is the Close Vote review queue. On SO it will never be empty, so essentially we need more reviewers, especially ones as dedicated as <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/401211/congratulations-to-edchum-for-100-000-close-reviews?cb=1"">EdChum</a>. Now ofcourse there is a problem with people doing poor reviews, which was discussed a lot over the past few months, and features to remediate (at least part) of the issue <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/346901/improving-the-review-queues-project-overview"">are being implemented</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Badges</strong><br>
Currently there are 3 review badges to be earned per queue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custodian (bronze) - Complete at least one review task. This badge is awarded once per review type</li>
<li>Reviewer (silver) - Complete at least 250 review tasks...</li>
<li>Steward (gold) - Complete at least 1000 review tasks...</li>
</ul>
<p>So after doing 1000 reviews in a queue the incentive to do more reviews ends. While we could really use more good reviewers.</p>
<p>Hence I propose we <strong>add badges that award more reviews</strong>, with incremental bigger gaps between them in terms of requirements. For example 2500, 5000, 10000 etc. As the current steward badge is already a gold badge these new badges would, of course, also be gold. Unless we are willing to implement something like platinum (which I don't see as very useful).</p>
<p><em>Alternatively</em> we could make the steward badge be awarded for every 1000 reviews completed per review type.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/126631/6"">Since May 2012</a>, though, such questions weren't supposed to be hidden in this manner on meta sites.</p>

However, if you follow the tag link above, you won't see that question listed in the list of questions with that tag.</p>
<p>At first, I thought that this was a Meta.SE specific bug, as it was being treated as a main site for these purposes. However, I have two reasons to doubt that: first, this site is correctly classed as a meta site for many other purposes (e.g. allowing unanswered duplicate targets, disabling the <code>RemoveAbandonedQuestions</code> Roomba criterion, etc.), and second, I found <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/273468/377214"">this post</a> which talks about a historically-locked question on a per-site meta that was hidden in the same manner. That post was made in January 2016, so it seems to have been broken for a long while.</p>
<p>Why are historically-locked questions hidden on meta sites now? Is this a (long-standing) bug, or was there a feature change at some point? (Or was the May 2012 edit incorrect?)</p>

"354703","404 error on deleted question's timeline","<p>So, I was looking at a question on the network. Specifically, I was looking at its timeline.</p>
<p>As I was looking at it, the question got deleted. I didn't realize at the time, but I did notice when I tried to click one of the filter buttons. When I clicked the filter button, I got a 404 error.</p>
<p>This confused me at first, and I assumed that somehow one of the filter buttons suddenly broke. However, after a little investigation, I realized the question had been deleted, and then suddenly it all made sense.</p>
<p>Worth noting in this story is that I do not have delete privileges on this particular site.</p>
<p>So, my question is: is this behavior intentional? That is, is the timeline supposed to give a 404 error on deleted questions instead of the standard &quot;this was removed by the author&quot; or &quot;this was removed for reasons of moderation&quot; message? If so, could you explain why you chose to do this?</p>
<p>If this is not intentional (like if it's an over site or bug), then could we maybe extend the deletion message to the timeline for non-delete privileged users? I feel like getting a 404 message from one of the UI's buttons gives the user the wrong idea of what happened. It makes it seem like the interface is broken, when, in reality, it's just a weird edge case sticking its ugly head. I feel like adding the delete message to this screen makes it more clear to the user what actually happened.</p>

"354729","Are votes preserved on meta sites when an active user is deleted?","<p>Recently on one of my SE sites, a user who was a highly active voter (over 1000 votes on each of main and meta) deleted their account. As expected, there was no accompanying loss of rep for other users, since <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/268608/278659"">votes are preserved and attributed to Community when a high-voting account is deleted</a>. But today I noticed that many posts on the per-site meta have scores 1 point below where they were before. This user actually had more votes on meta than anyone else, and it's a rather quiet meta site so losing all those votes, even from a single user, actually feels significant.</p>
<p>I don't know the threshold above which a user is considered &quot;too highly voting&quot; to have their votes removed together with their account, so let me first ask:</p>
<p><strong>Is there a threshold for not removing votes of a deleted active account on <em>meta</em> sites? Or are votes on meta <em>always</em> removed when an account is deleted?</strong></p>

Hello highlight.js! Swapping out our Syntax Highlighter</a> that the syntax:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;!-- language: lang-foo --&gt;

    something in the Foo programming language
</code></pre>
<p>is not supported any more. (Why? I couldn't find the reason, but maybe I just missed it.) Yet <strong>a very large number of existing questions and answers were written to use that style. What should be done about them?</strong></p>
<p>This is a particularly pressing problem on more complex questions about inter-language integration and comparison, as the code snippets are not in a single language determined by the tags on the question. What's more, this style of language indication is going to be fairly common precisely because it was the simplest adaptation of the style that was produced by the post-writing support UI: doing a cut-n-paste job to fix up the highlighting used to be a quick job because it was always pasting whole lines.</p>
<p>“Solutions” involving volunteers going through potentially thousands of posts <em>each</em> to find places to fix are non-starters. There's no easy way to search for where the issue might be present, and the amount of effort to apply all the fixes correctly is going to be significant. To my mind at least, it would be easier to reverse the decision to not support the <code>&lt;!-- language: ... --&gt;</code> syntax as that only involves a small number of people having to work and produces things that can be applied across the whole database of posts easily.</p>

For an example, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/64192481/1"">https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/64192481/1</a> is a question where the embedded code is now being highlighted entirely wrongly as Typescript and C#, neither of which is even remotely correct in visual appearance (critically in this question, the comments are not being highlighted as such); I “fixed” it by forcing the highlighting language to <code>bash</code> but that's wrong (it's a language that has nothing to do with the question) so I don't see it as a “fix” that should be encouraged at all.</p>
<p>Now, I know that highlight.js supports Tcl — I can see a correct example on their demo page — so the failure is definitely not an upstream problem. (The other tag on the question definitely doesn't have a highlighter.)</p>
<hr />
<p>There's got to be many other languages in the “long tail” of questions on this site that suffer from similar problems. I definitely can't list them all. But any sane solution to this needs to be not just for one language not currently on the blessed list; that's just kicking the ball slightly further down the road.</p>

I need it to work around the corporate firewall blocking all file uploads (including all types of images, and even putting the data URI into the image upload dialog doesn't work).</p>

"355008","Is it acceptable to team up with other users to cause flag-based autodeletion of comments and posts?","<p>This may be a controversial question, but I think it is important to know the opinion of the community (and hopefully of SE) on this.</p>
<p>In the comments on a recent answer to another question, I have seen some users discussing the possibility of teaming up to flag comments and posts they deem inappropriate, in order to trigger the automatic deletion of those posts due to reaching the flag threshold (comments are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/17365/643262"">automatically deleted after 3+score/3 flags</a>, and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/58035/643262"">posts are automatically deleted after 6 &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;rude or abusive&quot; flags</a>). <strong>Note that I am not against the particular goal of these users. I just want to discuss the appropriateness of coordinated flagging in general.</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, there exist already on the big sites coordinated efforts to close or delete posts with the aim of keeping the site clean and clearing the review queues (<a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2165/cured"">CURED</a> on Math.SE, and <a href=""https://socvr.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOCVR</a> on SO). These efforts are viewed as a good thing because they keep the sites clean. It might then be natural to also allow coordinated flagging.</p>
<p>On the other hand, flag-based actions have a stronger effect on the authors of the posts. Deleted comments cannot be seen by almost anyone, and flag-deleted posts lead to a -100 reputation penalty. Coordinated flagging gives a group of 3 to 6 users some powers that only moderators have (i.e., delete comments). These users have not been elected, and it might happen they make deletion decisions that do not represent what the majority of the community wants. My interpretation of the flag threshold is that, if enough users <em>independently</em> decide that a post is rude/spam, then it probably is. However, if this decision is not <em>independent</em>, then this argument does not necessarily hold anymore.</p>
<p>So what are the thoughts of the community and of SE on coordinated flagging? Is it a good thing under some circumstances? Or should it be prevented?</p>

Eventually I figured out that that there is a plain text, normal-sized, linked word &quot;chat&quot; (!) between &quot;help&quot; and &quot;log out&quot; (!!) inside the drop-down menu on the far right (!!!).</p>
<p>I want to make it clear here that <em>people can use the Stack Exchange network perfectly well day-in, day-out without ever opening that menu, or even necessarily recognizing it as a menu</em>. So it seems miraculous to me that I was even able to figure out that much, and have no idea how or why I should be expected to know about this obscure &quot;chat&quot; link.</p>
<p>But <strong>even then, it does not solve the problem</strong>. Once I have clicked <code>chat</code> here, I - apparently - have to scroll to the bottom of page 1 of the list of existing chat rooms, find and click a &quot;create a new room&quot; button that is labelled in quite small text, fill out a form to create the room - and <em>then go back to the original post</em> in order to <em>write a comment manually</em> including an invite link.</p>
<p>All of this to reproduce what is single-click functionality - but only when the system arbitrarily decides that it's had enough comment spam.</p>
<p>I am on my hands and knees - please help me to avoid spamming comment sections, because I do not want to spam comment sections. It has been <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107274/take-it-to-chat-before-the-message"">nearly 9 years</a> that people have been asking for this, and now when I search I am sent around in circles of such ancient meta posts (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/96247/is-it-possible-to-import-comments-into-a-chat-room-without-the-link-appearing"">1</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100967/should-move-to-chat-be-provided-on-demand-as-a-button-perhaps"">2</a>). As far as I can tell from those posts, there has never been a non-trivial objection to this feature, just... a lack of action. The last link in particular shows many well-respected community members filing in at various points over the last 9 years to voice support.</p>
<p>I don't understand why the site bothers to offer chat functionality at all if it's going to be this obscure. I have an easier time figuring out Wikipedia governance's internal processes than this.</p>

"355814","Missing score in Top Users section of a tag","<p>I was looking at the Top Users page on <a href=""https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tags/rambam/topusers"">a particular tag</a> and I saw that it showed that in the past 30 days I had answered two questions for a total score of 3:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Hti4y.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Hti4y.png"" alt=""Screenshot of Top Users page"" /></a></p>
<p>This seemed odd, as I had recently answered a question in this tag that has a score of +7 (i.e. more than the total of all my answers in the past 30 days according to the listing). At first I thought that it might not be counting my most recent answer (i.e. the system might only update every so often and it had not updated since my last answer), and indeed in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/68892/390967"">this answer</a> it is claimed that it gets updated at midnight UTC.</p>
<p>However, if you don't count my most recent answer then I have only one answer within the last 30 days. As you can see in my profile, my previous answer in this tag (prior to the one that is definitely being counted) was back in August, which is well more than 30 days ago:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/fGaN2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/fGaN2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of user profile tag page"" /></a></p>
<p>The Top Users listing must necessarily then be counting my most recent answer, and it is counting it as having a score of +1. I then thought that perhaps if it updated at midnight then it might have only had +1 at midnight with the other upvotes coming on the next day. However, the timeline of the answer shows that all the upvotes came on the same (Stack Exchange) day:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/kvPva.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kvPva.png"" alt=""Screenshot of answer timeline"" /></a></p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the timestamp of the answer you can see that it was posted less than two hours after midnight. I am almost 100% certain that more than one of the upvotes came within the first 22 hours.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that it seems to be only the &quot;Last 30 Days&quot; column that has this issue; the &quot;All Time&quot; column lists my score as 292, which seems to be up to date as that is what it shows in the tag page of my profile:</p>

<p>Until a second moderator sees and responds to that redaction the sensitive information is public.  Why require a second moderator to effect this change?</p>
<p>The legitimate purpose of redacting is to remove sensitive information.  Delaying that seems at odds with that purpose.  Furthermore, as a moderator I could unilaterally delete the post – a far more drastic action that takes effect immediately.</p>
<p>I can't think of many moderator actions that require a second moderator approval to take effect.  Even if there is an argument for requiring the review of moderator redactions by a second moderator, in the case of redaction the redaction should take effect <em>immediately</em> and then it should be queued for review.

"356390","Where to post question about PJL protocol support on specific printer model","<p>I have often questions that fall between software and hardware. My C# code sends print jobs to printers and listens back to the progress messages (using PJL language). Sometimes it stumbles on various issues caused by hardware specific implementation differences. For instance, a printer may receive the commands just fine but does not send any status back. So it is IT topic, but one that does not make sense without programming perspective. Contacting printer manufacturer is usually slow and difficult process.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/355419/what-are-our-policies-regarding-underage-users"">What are our policies regarding underage users?</a>.</p>
<p>This is posted with the <a href=""/questions/tagged/mod-agreement-policy"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mod-agreement-policy&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mod-agreement-policy</a> tag, so it is officially part of the moderator agreement. This is one of the new things in the changed moderator agreement, and I'm not entirely sure how this will be interpreted in practice.</p>
<p>The linked policy does use the imperative asking mods to report underage users, but it doesn't use stronger language like &quot;must report&quot; or similar. I'm not sure if this is still SE asking politely or SE requiring moderators to report underage users at a similar level as other clauses in the main moderator agreement.</p>
<p>The main moderator agreement is quite clear to me, it does use straightforward language and clearly spells out the obligations of a moderator. The linked policies are referenced with the following sentence there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will abide by all other officially announced moderator and user policies made available to me.</p>

<p>So they are supposed to carry the same weight as other obligations in the main moderator agreement. But those linked policies are written in a very different way, they are much less explicit and contain much more context.</p>

"357570","How can a Stack Exchange site expand scope significantly, where the scope expansion implies a new name and URL?","<p>Consider <a href=""https://freelancing.stackexchange.com"">Freelancing SE</a> as a hypothetical [for now!] example. Freelancing has been in beta for 7+ years. Given its narrow scope, it doesn't get many questions each year, and that number is shrinking. It may be desirable for a site like Freelancing to expand scope; e.g. to permit self-employment or small business questions that would not previously have been considered on-topic.</p>
<p>I expect for an SE site to expand the scope of what's on-topic beyond <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/37227/freelancing"">what was contemplated at launch</a>, the community would hold discussions at the community meta site and ideally achieve some kind of consensus. (I was involved as a pro-tem moderator at Money SE early on and participated in many of these kinds of discussions.)</p>
<p>But what about when the scope expansion contemplated by a community is significant enough to require both a <strong>new name</strong> and <strong>new URL</strong>? Using the example of Freelancing SE, what if it decided to broaden to Self Employment, or more generally, Small Business? Stack Exchange community moderators cannot effect such a change. I expect the Stack Exchange community management team would help with a change like this — but what would the SE community management team need to see from the community and moderators in order to agree to such a change and effect the actual change?</p>
<p>I looked for precedent elsewhere in the Stack Exchange network where a major scope change involved both a site name change and site URL change and discovered that <a href=""https://video.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115/proposal-to-add-video-to-this-site"">Audio SE, while in beta, had merged with the Video and Film Production proposal</a>.</p>
<p>However, that isn't a great example, for two reasons: First, the change was proposed and seconded by the founders of Stack Overflow, rather than at the grassroots level. Second, the resulting site did indeed get a new name and URL, but eventually the <a href=""https://video.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/357/moving-avp-to-video-se-next-steps"">combined AVP SE site split into two</a>.</p>

I want to change it to link to <a href=""https://raywoodcockslatest.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my new blog</a> across all Stack Exchange sites. How can I do that?</p>
<p>In a browser where I am logged in to Meta, on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">the Home page</a> I click on my picture on the top bar. That opens <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/626767/ray-woodcock"">my Activity page</a>. This, too, has Profile and Network Profile links at top left and right corners, respectively.

<p>That suggests that the link to my old blog must be set by the Network Profile link. Clicking on that takes me to a page that lists my old blog's URL, but provides no apparent way to change it. There is an Update Profile Info link at the right, but clicking on that oddly opens a dialog offering to &quot;Choose a site to copy profile information from.&quot;</p>

The answer to his question was to use the Profile (not Network Profile) link &gt; click the Edit link. The appearance (and, apparently, the functionality) of the page has changed since then.

<p>The thing is that, I don't know if I had a little too much eggnog, but I see the Winter Bash hats double. Especially when executing code on StackOverflow: one hat stays static on the page while the other hat accompanies the profile picture. You can see one example on <a href=""https://es.stackoverflow.com/a/414673/250"">this answer on StackOverflow en Español</a>:</p>

<p>I would have expected the hat to be an overlay on top of the profile, but it seems it isn't. There are two (one for the avatar picture and another for the profile card?) and one doesn't move as expected... either that or I had one-too-many cups of eggnog. Funny thing is that it seems to fix itself after a few expand/collapses.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems like a little happy Winter-Bashy bug. It doesn't seem too important and I don't know if it has been reported before (I searched for it, but didn't find it).</p>

<p>I understand the rationale of hiding the review history of a post from the current reviewer, to prevent the reviewer from being influenced by other users' decisions. However, this rationale does not apply to moderators, who are expected in many communities to not use their review hammer except in flagrant cases. As a moderator, sometimes I am interested in the review history of a post but I do not want to do the review. For example, on Spanish.SE recently there were discussions about why the Low Quality Posts review queue was slow. To contribute to those discussions, I had to manually go to the site's review history and Ctrl-F for the posts that were still in the queue. This is inconvenient and time-consuming. The &quot;show review history&quot; mod link on posts does not help either, as it also brings me to the review task.</p>

<p>However, I already got the hat while it's only 10:55 UTC as I'm writing this; more than 12 hours before December 25th midnight. I think this is because the window actually starts <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B14:00"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">14 hours</a> before UTC midnight, not twelve. Furthermore, this would suggest the hat is only available until December 25th, 12:00 UTC, so only 24 hours, which is not correct (I suppose): date-based hats have always been available until <em>the next day</em> 12:00 UTC. Can the wording be changed to something like</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the early years of Security.SE, giving sec.SE t-shirts to speakers at conferences and competition winners really drove positive awareness and growth, and I know getting t-shirts from other sites kickstarted my forays out to bicycles.SE, lego.SE etc. I see from <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/358195/swag-is-coming-back?cb=1#comment1196455_358232"">@Catija's comment</a> that this swag run is only going to be SE/SO due to costs/logistics, and there is no current intention to offer swag for purchase.</p>
<p>But it should be possible for this to be federated out - the logos exist, and small run printers abound in many countries, so could the management of smaller-scale swag for non-trilogy sites be handled by moderators of those sites?</p>
</li>
<li><p>My other thought is for users who haven't hit 100k or 250k on one site, but have a total rep across multiple sites (yes, I count myself in this group: over 250k across the network, but no more than 60k on any one site). Will there be a &quot;Masters of None&quot; swag package?</p>
