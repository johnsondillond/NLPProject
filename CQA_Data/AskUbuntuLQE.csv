<a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/922650/installing-windows-10-after-installing-ubuntu"">Installing Windows 10 after installing Ubuntu</a> </del></p>

<p><del> I got to successfully run Windows and downloaded some drivers for it to function properly. Since it broke GRUB and now it automatically boots first, I had to use <strong>boot-repair</strong> with my live FD. </del></p>

<p><del> I don't know if my BootInfo summary is accurate so I don't want to post it, but since I just ran a  <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Crhiw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Recommended repair</strong></a>. I'm hoping I did it the right way.  </del></p>

<p><del> However, the issue arises after the repairs have been done: </del></p>

<p><del> 1) Ubuntu works if you select it as the boot priority, Grub appears normal
 but with the messy stuff. </del></p>

<p><del> The entries that <em>start with Windows boot</em> to Windows (becomes a <strong>stretched 800 x 600 loading screen first</strong>, then loads, then can't get past the lock screen, <strong>I'm unable to see my user or whatever, it just displays the time and date</strong>) </del></p>

<p><del> 2) Windows also works if you select it as the boot priority too. Normally. I can log in and actually use it. </del></p>

<p><del> Now I'm totally fine with this setup if it really can't work, but wouldn't it be nice if they were all in Grub and I can just choose whatever I want to boot to? :( </del></p>

<p><del> I still have Fast Boot &amp; Secure Boot disabled by the way. I apologize if I sound dumb, I really don't know much about Linux or dual-booting but I do want to learn. And it's also 2:34 AM here, I'm awake &amp; still trying to fix this haha. </del></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> :
It's now 8:35 AM. Windows can now successfully boot &amp; be used through GRUB. I just ran the boot-repair tool multiple times. </p>

<p>I am however bothered by how it becomes a stretched 800 x 600 loading screen first. Also, how do I fix the entries on the GRUB bootloader? It seems messy to me, and I read in an answer here before that the entries should only be <em>Ubuntu, Windows, and memtest (plus the other grub stuff)</em>. Help please?

"846365","Setting an IP address for each terminal window","<p>For my project I have to develop a TCP client server connection in c. I've done both files and they are both working with the localhost address 127.0.0.1. However, I´d like to run two server simultaneously, one as 127.0.0.1 and the other as 127.0.0.2 for example. </p>

<p>To do that, I would like to set an IP address for each terminal window. I haven't found how to do that. I've found some information about loopback, <code>ip addr add 127.0.0.2 dev lo</code>, but don't know how to run each window with an IP. Is that possible? How?</p>

<hr>

<p>I know it would work if I had different ports, or if I had different server's code only changing the specified IP as 127.0.0.1 on one and 127.0.0.2 on the other. However, the thing is, I want to know if it is possible to specify one for each terminal for example so I can use the same server code on them. That's for simulating connection to different computers. </p>

<p>As for now, I set the addr as <code>INADDR_ANY</code>, so any connection 127.X.X.X is accepted and works. But them again, on the same port number, which is what I need, I want to run 2 or more server simultaneously, so I need different IPs. And as localhost is set as 127.x.x.x, I want to narrow it down, so each terminal receives ""part"" of the localhost address</p>

"771913","zfs mirror /home partition only?","<p>I've just installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu 16.04 and would like to know if it's reasonably possible to ZFS-mirror a pair of PARTITIONS on two matching SSDs to accommodate my /home directory only.</p>

<p>I've googled around and have found only a few hints suggesting it's possible to create mirrored ZFS on disc partitions rather than whole discs but have discovered no explicit commentary about how to implement that solution. It's always about pooling entire discs.</p>

<p>Until some future Ubuntu release provides a native-install option for ZFS, it would be enough that I could merely mirror partitions for greater data integrity for irreplaceable contents which matter most to me -- without facing what appears to be a fairly complex hat dance to manually install the entire root system on ZFS.</p>

<p>That would also take me to a level of bleeding-edginess which I tend to avoid since I'm more a business user than a geek. Which is to say I use technology but don't adore it.</p>

<p>Can anyone point to some reference out there on this subject which I've not yet found? Or else offer some explicit hints about how to implement a partitions-only zfs solution?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>ADDED: It appears what I was looking for is well documented in the FreeBSD Handbook references to ZFS.</p>

"772309","Need disk partition space advice in a dual-boot scenario","<p>I'm using a laptop with 1TB HDD running Windows 10. I'm about to install Ubuntu 16.04 on it and dual boot. I'm wondering how much disk space shall I give to both OSes because I want to keep them both on the same partition (C drive).</p>

<p>My aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows boot shouldn't slow down.</li>
<li>If there's a safety threshold (because I've seen at some place that Windows System Restore needs at least 50GB free space or something) of memory size for Windows C drive, I want to keep a healthy margin above that size.</li>
<li>I don't want to compromise Ubuntu by giving all importance to Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>My framework:</p>

<ul>
<li>My personal files and data are all stored in drives other than C drive. Big software like Maya and Adobe MasterCollection and games are not installed in C drive.</li>
<li>The C drive is 99.9GB and 49GB is free right now.</li>
<li>Even with Ubuntu, I'll store my data on those other drives (like B for bulky software, A for personal files, D for movies, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>My question: <strong>How much space shall I allocate to both OSes looking at all this information?</strong> </p>

<p>I have a related question -- if I'm running Ubuntu, does the disk usage required by Windows (reserved disk space for Windows) get invoked too? Suppose I give Windows x GB and Ubuntu y GB then if I boot with Ubuntu, will I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only be able to use y (C drive - x GB)?</li>
<li>Be able to use the whole C drive?</li>
<li>(If x &lt; y) experience no problems because Windows isn't invoked at all?</li>

<p>All packages are installed in the latest Version. I did just updated:</p>

<p>I think the problem is of that kind: There are packages which has python 3 as dependency. Now that I have installed 3.7 and try to remove 3.6, package management thinks, that dependencies are not satisfied any more.</p>

<p>If that is not the case, how can I list packages which are installed and depend on 3.6 but not on 3.7?</p>

<p>It is not practical to uninstall python3.6 as a lot of packages depending on this very version and are not satisfied with 3.7. For example gedit does not like 3.7: <a href=""https://packages.ubuntu.com/cosmic/gedit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://packages.ubuntu.com/cosmic/gedit</a></p>

<h2>What I did to get in this mess</h2>

<p>I'm a new ubuntu convert and tried dual booting my lenovo ideapad 100 with Ubuntu gnome and windows 10.
 Turns out i failed, I installed ubuntu in legacy mode because that was the only way the laptop would let me. I didn't delete my windows partitions but windows 10 can't boot now, I guess I will need to reinstall it in legacy mode (How do I do that? Being able to use my old partitions would be great too).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Installing ubuntu from 32 bit to 64 bit</h2>

<p>Another problem I have is that I installed the ubuntu GNOME 32 bit version, thinking I couldn't use the 64 bit version called AMD64, because i have an intel processor( Only later did I realize that i can, and should've installed that). So I looked around and found that I can somehow upgrade it in the terminal, but that reinstalling it completely is better and less hassle. This being an almost clean install I don't mind reinstalling, but how am I supposed to do that? ( + I've already flashed the needed 64 bit image on a USB)</p>

<p>BUT, I'm a complete novice and don't understand a lot of the jargon.
For example, the ""live CD"" I think I should use is my original Ubuntu 14.04 installation CD - is this right ? </p>

<p>Also I'm not sure I know what they mean by ""partition table"" - where do I find this for my computer? </p>

<p>Would be grateful for any assistance anyone can provide - preferably an ""Idiot's step-by-step"" guide.</p>

<li><p>Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both C: and G: are WD PCIe SSD 256Gb card.</p>
<p>On C: is installed Windows 10 Pro (properly working). On G: I wanted to install Ubuntu 16.04 (desktop.amd64) LTE (or superior) and have a dual boot. After having prepared an ISO CD-ROM and changed the UEFI/BIOS setting to enable the booting from CD-ROM I could see the GRUB window. Unfortunately though, after selecting &quot;Try Ubuntu Without Installing&quot; I received a black screen with a series of scary ACPI errors (like &quot;AE_NOT_FOUND&quot; or &quot;Namespace lookup failure&quot; or &quot;Method parse/execution failed&quot;)! Those errors change all the time in number, but the messages seem to be similar or actually always the same.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/PUpgk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PUpgk.jpg"" alt=""Attached is a link to a picture of them"" /></a></p>
<p>I have the same problem with a USB drive with the same ISO image. There's no way to get out of such black screen unless I reboot the system. The same thing trying the direct Installing option.</p>
<p>Following one of the suggestions from the Asus Custumer Service I changed the following settings in BIOS/UEFI:</p>
<p><sub>BIOS &gt; BOOT &gt; FAST BOOT &gt; DISABLED<br />
BIOS &gt; BOOT &gt; CSM &gt; LAUNCH CSM &gt; ENABLED<br />
BIOS &gt; BOOT &gt; SECURE BOOT &gt; OS TYPE &gt; OTHER OS</sub></p>
<p>without any result.</p>
<p>The Customer Service told me that Asus Rog MAXIMUS X Hero Motherboard doesn't support Linux. Another Asus technician suggested me to download the Ubuntu 17.04 instead because according to him this last one is UEFI compatible. Is this the solution?</p>

<p>What I need to know how to do is, I need the number that is randomly generated to be compared with each individual integer from the user input. So first the 1's place is compared, then the 10's place compared, then the 100's, and so on and so forth until all 8 digits have been compared.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I compare the generated number with a specific place value in the user input and once that number has been matched, make the function compare with the next place value?</p>

"1012809","Slow boot or no boot at all - how did i mess up my ubuntu installation this time?","<p><strong>UPDATE 2018-03-23</strong></p>

<p>So, i finally identified the problem. Its all about mounting NTFS paritions on startup on a dual boot setup. So if you want to share data between windows and linux, you might want to use FAT32 over NTFS. It seems windows sometimes unmounts the filesystem in a way, that causes linux to have troubles mounting it again. To fix the boot-problem, you can go into emergency console and type </p>

<pre><code>ntfsfix /dev/sdXX
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>sdXX</code> is the identifier of the ntfs partition. You can look that up in your <code>/etc/fstab</code> or by typing <code>df</code>. After runnung ntfsfix you are able to login by exiting the emergency console (simply type <code>exit</code>)</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST</strong></p>

<p>I recently decided to upgrade my pc and re-install ubuntu as well as windows. I must have made some terrible mistake because booting into ubuntu is working only every second attempt.</p>

<p>When the boot fails a emergency terminal will show up. I exported the log with the suggested <code>journalctl -xb</code> and uploaded the output for you (see link below)</p>

<p>The relevant parts of my hardware configuration:</p>

<pre><code>Asus M5A97 LE R2.0 Mainboard
    - PCIe 2.0 x 16: AMD Radeon R9 380
    - PCIe 2.0 x 4: PCIe &gt; M.2 Converter
        - 500GB NVME attached to M.2 Converter
    - PCI: Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi SB0730
    - SATA-3: 480GB SSD
    - SATA-3: 500GB HDD
</code></pre>

<p>The mainboard has no boot-from-pcie support, so i could not install windows or ubuntu directly to the NVME drive. I figured it might be okay to simply install the bootloader to the SSD (/dev/sda), place the /boot mount on a primary partition on the ssd too (/dev/sda3) and mount everything else onto the nvme.</p>

<p>To avoid configuring grub i decided to first install windows 10 and then install ubuntu, so ubuntu will automatically write grub into the MBR of /dev/sda. That allways worked perfectly...</p>

<p>Additionally i created a ntfs-3g mount for the ssd to share data between my operating systems. I created only one ext4 partition on the hdd and mounted it on some user-folder (within /media)</p>

<p><strong>What i tried so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>At first i noticed that i had no sound. Because i bought the mainboard second-hand i assumed the ac97 chip is broken and bought a second-hand soundcard (see above). I thought that might caused the boot-troubles, but that wasnt the case. I do have sound now but still the boot problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Then i read something about UUID issues in /etc/fstab because of multiple installation attempts and i checked all uuids and they were same as in /etc/fstab.</p></li>
<li><p>Then i read something about a wrongly mounted swap partition, so i ummounted, swapoff and swapon the partition on /dev/nvme0n1p6. No success.</p></li>
<li><p>Then i found some post, that it might be better to remove the uuids from /etc/fstab and simply insert the partitions directly. So i did - no success.</p></li>
<li><p>Like always lightdm made lots of problems, so i installed gdm instead.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So what happens is that I change the session in GDM3 to Ubuntu On Xorg and then nothing happens. The mouse is frozen. Well, the laptop just freezes. It feels like I have nouveau installed or that is being loaded for some reasons. It is weird cause nouveau is blacklisted and I have added the following parameter to my grub: <code>nouveau.modeset=0</code> which helped me boot in the live disk when I wanted to install Ubuntu yesterday.</p>

<p>This gives me an error saying <strong>""No such file or directory""</strong>.</p>

<p>When I install these new ""Ubuntu"" applications for Windows 10, I want to have all my current Windows 10 features, just like Git for Windows.</p>

<p>For example, when I run <code>code .</code> to open Visual studio code(Installed on my windows 10), the bash from Git for Windows just open it, without installing it for that bash. Also is the same for Python, it detects my Windows's python.</p>

<p>The problem(MINGW64) is that its hard to do some stuff like changing the shell to Zsh or things like that. So I supose its better to have Ubuntu for Windows.</p>

<p>Now I have this problem, when I do <code>python --version</code> I get the message to install python... So I want to know how can I configure this Ubuntu to detect my Windows Path applications.</p>

I've tried using terminal codes to manually change the brightness but that lead me to crash my previous version. Which meant that I had to format my laptop and it's still dim. I can't seem to find any way to actually fix the brightness. I've suffered this issue in Windows, but it was easily fixed by changing the graphics card to PnP monitor then back to my Intel card fixing the issue. With Ubuntu I can't seem to find a way to do that, unless I'm not looking in the right places. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/lb7Ve.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lb7Ve.jpg"" alt=""this is my current state of brightness even though it says high.""></a></p>

<p>UPDATE: I have reached rock bottom. I've looked over videos on YouTube about changing the driver from open source to proprietary, tested and still didn't work. I've created a conf file to change the brightness when I reboot still no success. Currently my only option which I know will work is formatting my laptop to Windows. I can easily change the brightness from there. However, I don't have an image of Windows on a CD or USB. So right now I need help ASAP please. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: So I found a downloadable Windows 10 .iso file. So I gave up on Ubuntu. Note to whoever sees this; don't use Ubuntu unless you know what you're doing. Other wise just accept your fate and stick to your current OS even if it's killing you. </p>

"1169838","How to upgrade to Disco with limited /boot partition size?","<p>My bionic (18.04) install has a very small /boot size because Ubuntu used to suggest that for some reason. Running the <code>sudo do-release-upgrade</code> the upgrade stops saying that I need to make space for 300+ MB on /boot, but it's not that big in the first place:</p>

<pre><code>$ df -T | grep -v tmpfs
Filesystem               Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/kubuntu-root ext4      914G  702G  166G  81% /
/dev/sda1                ext2      228M   86M  131M  40% /boot
/dev/sdb2                ext4      823G  404G  377G  52% /media/myusername/WDblue2TBbkup
/dev/sdb1                ext4     1012G  574G  386G  60% /media/myusername/WDblue2TBmedia
</code></pre>

<p>Resizing is difficult because the boot lies at the front of the disk and theres an LVM2 partition there holding the rest of the OS &amp; data under the root directory (<code>/</code>) in a ext4 filesystem.</p>

<p>Any advice about how to proceed?</p>

<p>I'm considering </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>finding the kernel that disco would use and seeing if I can install that prior to running the upgrade</strong>. </li>
</ul>

<p>I've also upgraded in the past by simply </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>changing my <code>apt/sources.list</code></strong>, and associated files, to point to the later versions repos; that's a possibility too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strikes me at some point I'll need to fix the small <code>/boot</code></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>can I perhaps make a new boot directory as part of the LVM</strong> and just wipe the old boot partition?</li>
</ul>

<p>Hints, tips, suggestions, solutions all gratefully received.</p>

<p>Edit: I've just found the exact out-of-space message in my clipboard entries, it is ""<code>The upgrade has aborted. The upgrade needs a total of 319 M free space on disk '/boot'.</code>"".</p>

"1170596","What is meant by ""new packages"" in apt upgrade?","<p>The documentation for <code>apt upgrade</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>upgrade is used to install available upgrades of all packages
  currently installed on the system from the sources configured via
  sources.list(5). New packages will be installed if required to satisfy
  dependencies, but existing packages will never be removed. If an
  upgrade for a package requires the remove of an installed package the
  upgrade for this package isn't performed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what I am confused about is what is meant by ""new packages"" here. For example, let's say I installed CUDA 10.0, by downloading the .deb file and installing it with dpkg. I also know that there is a CUDA 10.1 version. Would running <code>sudo apt upgrade cuda</code> then delete all of my CUDA 10.0 files / libraries / documentation, and install the equivalents but for CUDA 10.1? Or would it install these files alongside CUDA 10.0? Or something else?</p>

<p>I prefer to keep my computer updated (mainly security related) anyways, but I was wondering <strong>is there was a more practical way</strong> then my current method. <strong>I keep Ubuntu installed two to three times so I can go back and forth and move files back from one to another to attempt to fix what is broke after the update</strong> and it's not always successful. Is there a better way to undo the updates when I reboot and have no sound, when I reboot and have no network, or when I reboot and it don't boot. Right now I currently have 17.04 and amazingly it is able to connect to wifi again, I thought I was going to have to reload after that one, I also have 16.10 (I think) installed and the sound didn't work and I have tried.</p>
<p><strong>Are the updates that important?</strong> One of the reasons I did the update to 17.04 is because 'Software' did not work after doing a previous update and when it was done I could see wireless networks but could not connect and I just copied files from 16.10 that I stopped using because sound working after a update.

According to <a href=""https://www.paulfurley.com/randomize-your-wifi-mac-address-on-ubuntu-1604-xenial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> post, starting from NetworkManager 1.4.1+ we can do mac address randomization. Mine is 1.10.6 (using Ubuntu 18.04)-</p>

<pre><code>$ dpkg -s network-manager | grep '^Version:'
Version: 1.10.6-2ubuntu1.1
</code></pre>

<p>In that post he points to this <a href=""https://gist.github.com/paulfurley/978d4e2e0cceb41d67d017a668106c53/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gist</a> for configuration details. The gist is virtually identical except that it has an instruction - </p>

<pre><code># Be sure to change your existing (saved) connections in
# /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't quite undersand that nor do I know how to do it, so i skipped it and hoped for the best. The gist also had a link to a <a href=""https://blogs.gnome.org/thaller/2016/08/26/mac-address-spoofing-in-networkmanager-1-4-0/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gnome blog</a> for mac address spoofing in network manager in 1.4.0.</p>

<p>The author metioned to change the file in <code>/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d</code> and NOT in <code>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d</code> even though he gave an example showing changes in <code>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/30-mac-randomization.conf</code>.<br>
Now, in my case the <code>conf.d</code> from <code>/etc</code> contains only one file as follows -</p>

<pre><code>user@user:/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d$ ls
default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The other one (from <code>/usr</code>) has -</p>

<pre><code>user@user:/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d$ ls
10-dns-resolved.conf              20-connectivity-ubuntu.conf
10-globally-managed-devices.conf  no-mac-addr-change.conf
</code></pre>

<p>I edited the file <code>no-mac-addr-change.conf</code> from -</p>

<pre><code>[device-mac-addr-change-wifi]
match-device=driver:rtl8723bs,driver:rtl8189es,driver:r8188eu,driver:8188eu,driver:eagle_sdio,driver:wl

wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=yes
wifi.cloned-mac-address=random
ethernet.cloned-mac-address=preserve
</code></pre>

<p>And then I restarted Network Manager -</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
</code></pre>

<p>and also restarted WiFi from GUI, but the mac address is still the same.Checked it by <code>cat /sys/class/net/wlp2s0 address</code>  </p>

<p>Has it got something to do with that instruction in the gist that I didn't follow? What am I missing?    </p>

<p>Also do the file names matter ? Cause everywhere else I saw a different file name?</p>

<p>When I tested with Windows 7 x64 the PPPoE connection worked perfectly.</p>
<p>I have a 16.04.4 LTS (Xenial Xerus) server (no GUI) with 3 ethernet connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>eth0 - onboard NIC</li>
<li>eth1 - onboard NIC</li>
<li>wan0 - PCI-X NIC</li>
</ul>
<p>The ONT device is connected to &quot;wan0&quot;, and the PPPoE connection configured with &quot;pppoeconf&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;pppoeconf&quot; created a &quot;ppp0&quot; interface. PPP connection has two IP address: on public side there is a fixed public IP (for example FIX.EDI.PAD.DRE.SSS) and on the private side IP address is 10.0.0.1/32.</p>
<p><strong>From the Linux server terminal I could ping 8.8.8.8, google.com, browse any website with Lynx. And the server allowing SSH connections from the internet.</strong></p>
<p>So the PPPoE connection works perfectly.</p>
<p>This server is connected to subnetworks through &quot;eth0&quot;, &quot;eth1&quot; NIC(s). Subnetworks are logically separated by VLANs (eth0.11, eth1.22, eth1.33, ...)</p>

After installation, I was unable to connect to wifi, I read a lot of articles and different answers, but none of them worked for me. I don't have the possibility to connect by an Ethernet cable and also the terminal doesn't have some of the essential commands, so the only possibility is to figure out what is wrong with Wifi.<br>
<strong>Update:</strong> In some articles was recommended to download the drivers using terminal manually, but since I can't connect to internet, that's imposible and also to use some commands which the terminal didn't recognize, as it was suggesting to install them, for example ""make"".

at the same time i also purged and reinstalled ssh xauth openssh-client/server and all the other associated packages. Without touching any of the ssh settings in either ssh_config or sshd_config, the server still accepts the xforwarding request and still displays the gui windows on the server. Im getting ready to just reformat my ssd and start over, loosing patience with this.</p>

#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the

<p>Here's where it gets weird. Even though <code>dpkg -P tmetric{,-desktop}</code> went through  (no results were found for tmetric alone), after rebooting some tmetric GUI popped up asking whether I wanted to track my time.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this is quite disturbing for me, as I suspect there might be some automatic process running on the background which could potentially gather connection and share my data.</p>

<p>After that, I removed /usr/bin/tmetric (which turned out to be still there despite having tried all dpkg and apt -r and -P options), and I now want to make sure all traces of tmetric are gone. </p>

<p>So my question is: What is the list of all possible locations to check for some tmetric* file/folder?
Is it safe to remove it automatically? (I wonder whether trying something like <code>find / -name tmetric* -delete</code> would be suitable in this case) perhaps with some confirmation flag before it. </p>

<p>It appears <code>ubuntu-report</code> is sending very unique information about your system - like a fingerprint, if not stopped with shell commands.

<p><strong>update</strong>: answer below argues that permission is asked before actually sending this information.</p>

<p>But now, I also frown upon a fresh minimal Ubuntu image connecting to the internet upon login. When logging in to the console, a Message of the Day (MOTD) is displayed. Something like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps I am being paranoid, but I think it is unacceptable that a mere login would send anything to the internet. If you do a connection to 'changelogs.ubuntu.com' every time you login on the shell, that can lead to potential security and privacy concerns. Am I the only one who is surprised about this and finds this unacceptable?</p>

<p>My question is: how can I safely use Ubuntu without compromising security or privacy?</p>

<p>In particular, my concern is with sending anything to the internet without permission. I don't want things to automatically connect or check or update to the internet in any way, unless I give the command to do that, with <code>sudo apt update</code> for example.</p>

<p>I tried playing with <code>/etc/update-motd.d</code> scripts but I could not find the script that was the culprit. I am kind of annoyed that I wasted a good hour on this stuff and still don't trust my Ubuntu system with ethernet/internet until this issue is resolved properly.</p>

"941368","Can't install an executable file","<p>I downloaded wine to play games like Wizard101 &amp; Pirate101, and I was able run the executable files like those games. But I had problems with other stuff on my computer and had to do a factory reset.</p>

<p>Once I did, I couldn't install Wizard101. When I clicked on the thing that should install I got the message </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An error occurred while loading the archive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I did another factory reset and installed and configured Wine again. But I got the same message. Is there any way I can install the game or any executable file and run with Wine?</p>

However sometimes after running the script when I then afterwards try to google something it shows that it's loading (anticklockwise circle in chrome) but never shows any progress. I can't quite find a regularity in when it works and when not. Any ideas?</p>

<p>The answers to similar questions suggest trying to install the packages manually.  But <code>fontconfig</code>, <code>libfontconfig1</code>, <code>libgtk2.0-0</code>, <code>libqt5svg5</code>, and <code>libuuid1</code> are already installed.  So are all the packages named as dependencies of <code>libapache2-mod-php5</code>.  So why won't it install?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I solved the problem by installing <code>php7.0</code> and <code>libapache2-mod-php7.0</code> instead, but I'd still like to understand these confusing error messages.</p>

<p>Are all these superblocks defect or is there some other problem?</p>

<p>To me it seems the information about the filesystem type may have been damaged. How can I set it to ext4? Can the 18.04 instance be rescued or reinstalled?</p>

<p>The 18.04 was not quite stable:</p>

<ul>
<li>sometimes it hung when powered down.</li>
<li>when clicking ""settings"" it would definitely freeze.<br>
What wondered me, at reboot I never saw a fsck.<br>
Are superblocks updated at powerdown? can these freezes be the cause of defect superblocks?  </li>

Verizon installed their fiber optic cable and a G1100 modem, and I have subscribed to their 1 Gig internet speed service.  Using Verizon's speed test, it shows that the download to the <strong>modem</strong> is 900+ Meg for download and upload.  But their speed test indicates that the down load speed to my pc ranges between 200 and 500 meg (upload speed has been as high as 800+ meg).  While talking to Verizon Support, I redirected the cat6 cable that Verizon used between their ONT and modem and connected it directly to the pc, bypassing the modem.  I still got the lower speeds.  I had shut off Ubuntu's Firewall (gufw), unchecked the security boxes in Firefox preferences, and had no other applications running.  Assuming Verizon's speed test ""from their network to their modem"" is correct, it looks like my pc has an internal limit.

<p>My setup:</p>

<li><p>two GPUs both connected to my monitor</p></li>

<li>Connected via DP</li>
<li>No additional drivers (both graphic cards should be work without properitary drivers: <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver</a> )</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MSI X399 SLI Plus</li>
<li>AMD Threadripper 2950X</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to use the R7 360 card for ubuntu and RX 550 for virtual machines (KVM GPU passthrough)
So I followed this guide: <a href=""https://heiko-sieger.info/running-windows-10-on-linux-using-kvm-with-vga-passthrough/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://heiko-sieger.info/running-windows-10-on-linux-using-kvm-with-vga-passthrough/</a>
In short: use dummy drivers for the RX 550 card so that they are not used within ubuntu.
After ""update-initramfs -u"" and rebooting I was not able to see anything but an orange screen. STRG + ALT + ENTF for reboot worked for me.</p>

<p>After recovering the initramfs by using a live system I just tried to change from mirroring to use the R7 360 as single monitor.</p>

<p>Now the strange thing, the mouse is working as expected but any input/window change (klick on button, move window, ...)/whatever is done witn an 3-5 seconds delay. Same thing for 3840*2160 and 1280*720. Also I could not see any sign that it is rendered in SW (top does not show a higher CPU usage for gnome-shell, Xorg or anything else).
I am not able to reproduce this with mirrord displays. In this setup both GPUs are working as expected (and yes, I checked if the monitor uses HDMI)
I also tried to reboot without any change.</p>

<p>The Device-Information shows anytime ""Radeon RX 550 Series (POLARIS12 / DRM 3.23.0 / 4.15.0-43-generic, LLVM 6.0.0)"" as GPU.</p>

<p>I tried to find something to change the primary GPU but the most guides are for Intel/Nvidia systems with Nvidia drivers to change this.
I also could not find anything which could explain this delay.</p>

<p>In my opinion there are two possible action plans:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to resolve the delay issue, maybe by selecting the R7 360 as primary device. (but do not know how because I find only guides where this option is within a Nvidia Driver)</li>
<li>try to use dummy drivers for the RX 550 and hope that this will resolve the delay issue and not only the orange screen. (maybe using another guide but do not think that this will help)</li>
</ul>

After removing the browser the dialog is the same: it shows a remove control. After closing the <strong>Ubuntu Software</strong> application and restarting it, it will still show a remove control.</p>

<p>I have a need to reinstall Firefox without using the command line because the command line is not yielding satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Note that I am not interested in ""Firefox Quantum"". Note there is a bug wherein the label next to the Firefox icon is ""Firefox"" when in fact it might be better as ""Firefox Quantum"" but that can be posted as yet another askubuntu.com problem.</p>

"796779","SSH Authentication Problem","<p>i'm currently trying to setup a few virtualboxes (ubuntu 15.10) to simulat a network i'm developing some software for. For this i need to setup a SSH connection, this is working, but i can login without the rsa-pubkey setup, just with the user-password from the vbox. The sshd_config file looks like it should and i cant find the problem. Is it maybe a virtualbox problem?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>my problem with the situation is, that i want the usual ssh-server setup with rsa-authentication. Right now i just can login without it and cant figure out what i have to do.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Ok my keyring did the autologin ofc :D i'm too stupid sometimes. Thanks for your help anyway!</p>

"1184998","Make command doesn't execute but Makefile.am existed","<p>I have been using Ubuntu (16.04) for only a week at most and I am still learning (with lots of confusion) on using the terminal.</p>

<p>So right now I am following a tutorial for TensorFlow YOLO tutorial on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npZ-8Nj1YwY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube</a>, and I get it right until the tutor type <code>make</code> command in the terminal (minute 7:39) and it started to execute or do something.</p>

<p>But when I did it (type <code>make</code> and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>), it gives out this error.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/D7TfY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/D7TfY.png"" alt=""The error after pressing Enter""></a></p>

<p>Thus, I went and check if there is any Makefile in the directory, and there is.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/AZ0kS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AZ0kS.png"" alt=""Makefile exist in the directory""></a></p>

<p>Therefore, how do I execute the <code>make</code> command in the terminal? Is there anything that I did wrong or didn't do specifically ? Or is it because he did it on Raspberry Pi and I did it on Ubuntu (but then why I could follow until the minute 7:39 without a problem) ?</p>

"1113001","Modifying photo's date stored inside the photo file from files name?","<p>I am using Google's PhotScan app to scan all my old photos that are taken before the digital cameras age, and I am saving these photos using the date of the photo (example: 19821011_trip.jpg, yyyymmdd_trip.jpg).</p>

<p>But this method saves the current date of taking the photo using the app in the photo's properties, so what I was trying to write is a script that will take the date information from the photo's filename and correct the date that is stored in the photo's file properties.</p>

<p>Looking forward to get your help.</p>

"952622","Connection Sharing over Ethernet Problem","<p>I got my server recently, a pretty beefy server for Virtual Machines currently setup on Proxmox. But my server being away from my router, (router which is positionned somewhere i cannot put the server), it was still close enough to my desktop, so i plugged my server to my desktop using an ethernet cable hoping to share my desktop's wifi. I went on connection settings and set iPV4 to ""Shared to other computers"", like all wifi to ethernet sharing guides suggest. I have then set a static ip on my server which lets me access Promox on 10.42.0.3 in this case, but somehow, my server still does not receive any internet and i cannot ping anything but my desktop's ip.
What could I do?</p>

"716555","Website Editor wanted","<p>I'm asking what might on the surface look like a repeat question but it's not because no one has actually answered the question asked.  I'm looking for the equivalent of FrontPage for Ubuntu.  FrontPage is a site and not just a page editor because it maintains links as pages graphics are moved around and even when the architecture is changed.  And, very important to a busy executive, it has an auto-thumbnail feature.</p>

<p>So far the advice has been </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn HTML and Javascript.  zero interest or time.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue Gryphon - gimpware that will probably go away with Mozilla's XUL API.  I've tried it and find it a decent <strong>page</strong> editor but not a site editor.  Plus he's abandoned 32 bit users.</p></li>
<li><p>Amaya - I think it would be a nice <strong>Page</strong> editor if it would run properly on my machine (12.04LTS).  As is, there is a 1 or 2 pixel line where the tool bar should be.  And it won't render anything until some toolbar action is taken.  I can work at it and hit a toolbar item with the cursor, whereup the page renders.  IT still appears to only be a page editor, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Brackets - HTML editor.  Not applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a CMS - I have a blog on WordPress.  Over my Hughsnet link it takes approximately 15 seconds for the first page to load while WP sends out seemingly hundreds of files.  My personal site's FrontPage-created index page loads in a second.  Maybe I'm the last guy on earth who cares about load times but I do.  I realize that not everybody has or can get a gigabit connection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I ask again, is there a <strong>website</strong> editor out there for Ubuntu?  I'll even consider a commercial product.  Or do I have to continue editing with FrontPage in a VM?</p>

How can I use Unix (or possibly Python) to find instances of multiple words fitting specific character-sharing criteria? For example, I want Words 1 and 2 to have the same fourth and seventh characters, Words 2 and 3 to have the same fourth and ninth characters, and Words 3 and 4 to have the same second, fourth, and ninth characters.</p>

<p>EDIT: For clarification, I need the code to return any words that share the same characters in given positions; I don't have specific characters (like ""d"" and ""g"" as given in the example) in mind. Also, I'd like it to be able to return words that don't fit ALL of the criteria; e.g. in the example given, Words 1 and 4 share a fourth character, but not necessarily the second, seventh, and ninth. With the program I'm running in its finished form, I'm expecting it to return a very small list of words (probably only ten) based on nine strict character-sharing criteria.</p>

<p>Found the driver I need (<code>bcmn43xx64.inf</code>). now just need to install ndiswrapper.</p>

<p>It shows up in the program manager as available from a ""universal source"",  but having no internet that's not much help.</p>

<p>most seemed to install in the program manager except one which insisted on me inserting my DVD ?!?!  I did this anyway and it still refused to install.</p>

<p>There was no obvious way to try running it other than through the terminal so I tried <code>ndiswrapper -V</code>.   A load of info about bits being missing and out of date.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much at the point of giving up.  Surely it can't be this hard?</p>

<p>Managed to uninstall the invalid driver and have reinstalled with the same file from a different source.  </p>

<p>Running <code>ndsiwrapper -l</code>  it now shows the driver as functional and the hardware as present.</p>

<p>My only remaining question is how do I get Ubuntu to recognize it?  I have tried rebooting and it isn't appearing.  Is there a set up wizard I can run or will I need to do some kind of manual set up?</p>

<p>Any help appreciated :)</p>

<p><em>Edit 3.</em></p>

<p>Still no luck getting this to work.  Nothing is ""appearing"" to let me use the hardware.</p>

<p>The only other clues are from <code>ndiswrapper -V</code>  which says the following:</p>

<p>And anyway, it's vulgar.</p>

<p>But the GUI shows no sign of a password form and gives no help at all to a user looking to change their password. If you go to that nameless system menu with the funny logo on the task bar, you can find under 'System' a 'Users Settings' menu that looks like it ought to have an option to change the user password. But it doesn't. If you click on help and type 'password', nothing comes up. If you open 'Settings Manager' from the funny menu and type password nothing comes up.</p>

I tried this once before but it said it would take a long time. How long would that be for a 128GB SSD? Also, what are the chances of this installation breaking my system?</p>

I am trying to share files from my ubuntu laptop on my home network.  I want only specific users to be able to access the samba shares, and require password authentication.  Currently, either Windows 10 has full access with no password required????  What is wrong with my samba config?</p>

<pre><code>#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
    workgroup = home

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
    server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
    dns proxy = no

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.

####### Authentication #######

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are ""standalone server"", ""member server"", ""classic primary
# domain controller"", ""classic backup domain controller"", ""active
# directory domain controller"". 
#
# Most people will want ""standalone sever"" or ""member server"".
# Running as ""active directory domain controller"" will require first
# running ""samba-tool domain provision"" to wipe databases and create a
# new domain.

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.

<p>Lo and behold, I log in to the most janky looking desktop I've seen in ages, with no way to undo the operation that wasn't even supposed to be happening in the first place. Attached is a picture of the OLD launcher/desktop I used to have, and also the same one I'm trying to get back to. </p>

<p>I can't decide which one is more annoying &amp; is pushing me more back towards Windows, the fact that I NEVER approved such a blatant and major change to my computer, or the fact that it's so blipping ugly &amp; dysfunctional to use.</p>

<p>I've tried looking for ways to restore it, but all the links I can find only instruct how to install a completely new desktop environment all together(KDE/Gnome/etc) -- which is NOT what I want.<br>

<p>This is extremely frustrating and unnecessary, because instead of simply asking me would I like to upgrade my desktop theme, where I could answer yes or no, now I have to take time and productivity out of my day to deal with this mess. </p>

"803367","Ubuntu 16.04.1 Post Upgrade - Not detecting hardware","<p>After poking at this nearly all day I have determined that for whatever reason Ubuntu is not detecting hardware changes with the video card. My most recent attempt at fixing it was to re-enable the onboard video with my motherboard, pull the Radeon card and see if it detected any hardware changes and did something different. It did not. Doing that made absolutely no difference at all. So why is it not detecting any changes in the video hardware and how can that be corrected? Or is that something that is too integral to Ubuntu to fix short of a fresh re-install? </p>

<p><strong>Originally</strong>: 
Let me start of by saying that this is not a ""why is there no fglrx?"" type of post. I've been using Ubuntu since 2011. While I'm not new to it, I don't live and breathe the ins and outs of the innards of it either. I do love my Ubuntu though. I prefer it over loading the dreaded Windows. That said, I just upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04.1 from 14.04 and I've been waiting for this for a while.... Saw that 16.04.1 was finally out and even though the updater wasn't offering it, triggered the upgrade. I saw that it said that the FGLRX drivers were depreciated, but that the AMDGPU drivers worked with my Radeon R9 380 card. Okay... cool. Went with the upgrade. Upgrade went pretty smoothly. Rebooted. Got into the login and beyond but my second monitor doesn't display anything. Kinda expected that. Went into Displays. It doesn't detect a secondary display. And it won't let me pick any other resolutions just a default 1366:768 (16:9) resolution. Poked around some and saw that supposedly the AMDGPU-PRO driver is supposed to be better. Alright. Went and installed that. Still the same situation. No secondary display and no additional resolutions. There are no config files in the /etc/x11/ directory. There is /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-amdgpu-pro.conf but what changes to it I need to make, I'm unsure. Please help.</p>

<p>I don't game from my system. I do some 3D modeling, but that's in Windows when I have to. I just want to be able to use the second monitor like I always do since that's how my workflow is most comfortable for me. (Primary focus on the big screen, secondary screen for IMs, email, reference materials, etc)</p>

<p>I'm competent enough to follow directions easily enough. One could say I know enough to be dangerous in linux. lol I'd really appreciate some help getting this resolved. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>**Edit 1# ** --  Was getting help from Reddit, but a moderator killed that. Anyways... Here's what I've done and where I'm at: 
lsmod shows neither radeon nor amdgpu (I manually looked and grepped for both)</p>

<p><code>Storm-Linux:~$ sudo xrandr xrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default Screen 0: minimum 1366 x 768, current 1366 x 768, maximum 1366 x 768 default connected primary 1366x768+0+0 0mm x 0mm 1366x768 76.00*</code> </p>

<p>I also uninstalled AMDPro, rebooted, saw that nothing changed in Displays (no change to resolutions, no additional monitors). Reinstalled the AMDPro drivers and rebooted again. Still no change to the Displays dialogue screen. Right now I'd just be happy to see a change in the screen resolution... Still want my dual displays, but I think the screen resolution and the dual displays issue are part of the same problem.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong> --
Burned and booted off of the Live CD for 16.04.1</p>

<p>lsmod shows that AMDGPU works fine there. </p>

<p><code>amdkfd                131072  1
amd_iommu_v2           20480  1 amdkfd
amdgpu                987136  6
i2c_algo_bit           16384  1 amdgpu
ttm                    94208  1 amdgpu
drm_kms_helper        147456  1 amdgpu</code></p>

<p>And for comparisons, here is a screenshot of my installed system vs the Live CD's Displays dialogue... there is obviously something wrong going on here. </p>

<p>This is a screenshot of the Displays dialogue where things are not right.

<p>Obviously the problem is software, not hardware. And since this is Linux I should be able to fix it without having to reload Ubuntu and install all my apps from scratch again.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #3</strong>:</p>

<p>I've uninstalled AMDPro and rebooted. No change in system behavior of course. I've copied the /var/log/Xorg.0.log to <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/21205770/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://paste.ubuntu.com/21205770/</a> </p>

<p>All vms are configured the same way in workstation, but the Ubuntu vm is not discovered in ""networks"" on Windows, and I can not connect to it from host. </p>

<p>The vm has internet connection, but the same situation occurs inside the vm itself. I can see all the other network locations there( host + all the vms), but the Ubuntu vm itself doesn't seem to be registering on the local network. </p>

<p>I use NAT, and I want to be able to use this for all vm's. I can connect to the other vm's through hostname, but as I said I can find no trace of this vm through ip or hostname. I find it very strange that this vm can detect other locations but not register !?</p>

<p>I have tried cloning + reinstalling this OS.</p>

<p>The <code>avahi/zeroconf</code> packages do help with discovery of other locations, as I can see them only when the avahi-daemon package is installed. </p>

<p>Also there is something weird going on with vmware-tools/open-vm-tools when using this distro. Workstation doesn't seem to correctly identify the installed tools, as ""vm meny"" keeps showing ""update vmware tools"".
I have tried both <code>open-vm-tools</code> &amp; <code>vmware-tools</code> from workstation distro.
I am sorry for providing potentially insufficient info, but I will have to update through this post.</p>

<p><code>DHCP</code> is working, windows network adapter + vm adapters are set to dynamic IP &amp; DNS.</p>

<p>Finally as I already said, EVERYTHING else is functional. I am connecting from Windows vm's to all other Linux vm's for cross-compiling by way of Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Still the same problem. I have tried several suggestions and workarounds both from this forum and other places, but I am unable to establish contact with this vm from host or other vm's. </p>

<p>My Kernel IP routing table looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.252.2   0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0
192.168.252.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 eth0
</code></pre>

<p>Now I know 169.254.0.0 is put there by zeroconf to patch my ip because there certainly are some problems. But what I am looking for is an answer to why Ubuntu 16.04 is interacting differently with NAT(networks in general actually), than say Mint Cinnamon ?</p>

<p>I have tried sooo many fixes out there, but I cannot ping my ubuntu guest from host, and I cannot connect to it from other network locations. 
The kernel ip routing table above is the one produced when I define 
/etc/network/interfaces file like this for dynamic routing:</p>

<pre><code># interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
</code></pre>

<p>So, I tried the suggestion of defining /etc/network/interfaces file like this:</p>

<pre><code>auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.252.0
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.252.2
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.252.2
</code></pre>

<p>... and endless variations of this. The info I get from the VIRTUAL NETWORK EDITOR in vmware, and there are again ABSOLUTELY NO reason why the fault should be anywhere else but in the Ubuntu OS, as all the other vms use the same setup. </p>

<p>There apparently seem to be differences in the implementation of AVAHI &amp; ZEROCONF in Ubuntu 16.04 and say Mint Cinnamon 17.3 or SuperX 3.0. So what's the deal ? 
What can I say ? i tried modifying the /etc/nsswitch.conf value of host parameterto :</p>

<pre><code>hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
</code></pre>

<p>, tried to modify the /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf to :</p>

<pre><code>#domain-name=alocal
</code></pre>

<p>, modify the /etc/default/grub file:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0""
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried to add a hostname in the /etc/network/interfaces file and then adding its ip address + hostname in c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts.</p>

<p>I tried uninstalling zeroconf packages and avahi packages separately and together. After deleting the avahi &amp; zeroconf packages I notice NO difference in this vm. Connectivity is the same. How can that be ??
In my (very humble) opinion, there seems to be an abundance of unnecessary packages(read: shi...), here. Until someone has a clear answer as to e.g why this OS as standard implements redirect of "".local"" &amp; the problems I addressed above - I am scrapping Ubuntu 16.04. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I installed libnss.myhostname package on the vm, and now I can ping it for the first name.... As ""ubuntu.local"". Problem is, it only returns ipv6 addresses, and the computer still doesn't show up under networks in Windows.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I added .local to the ""ubuntu"" name in the file hostname. Now I can ping ""ubuntu.local"", and I get in return ipv4 addresses.
Still, the hostname(or rather the netBIOS) name does not appear under Windows network. As I've learned, because Windows can not reference the mapping of it in the dns database.</p>

"724137","Partition problems when dual booting with Windows 10","<p>I got a laptop about two weeks ago. It was running Windows 10. It had a 1TB hard drive, and in Windows 10 the C: drive had 892 GB and the D: drive had 25GB. I decided to install Ubuntu. I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit. In the installation wizard, when it detected Windows Boot Manager, I chose to boot alongside Windows. It showed me a 957GB partition, and I allocated 351 GB to Windows and 606GB to Ubuntu. The installation worked fine. Ubuntu was running smoothly for about a week and a half, after which I experienced some problems. I messed around with some things, and I eventually caused Ubuntu to become unusable. I booted into Windows and tried to delete Ubuntu and return my laptop to the state it was in pre-installation. I went to computer management and deleted the Ubuntu partitions, and the C: drive returned to 892GB. However, in the UEFI settings ""ubuntu"" still existed, and booting into it showed a weird GRUB BASH command line. On entering ""exit"" pressing enter I was given a menu that looked like the UEFI boot menu, where I was given a choice of booting into Windows Boot Manager, which I did. I tried installing Ubuntu again, but this time when I chose to boot alongside the Windows Boot Manager, it showed me a partition where 18.7GB was allocated to Ubuntu and about 8GB was allocated to something called ""Files"". I went back and chose ""Something Else"". I saw my 1TB hard drive, which had 957 GB, and chose ext2 and mounted ""/"". ""Format drive"" was selected. On clicking ""Install now"", a warning was given that there was no swap space. I decided against installation. My question is, is there anyway to bring back the first partition, where it was Windows against Ubuntu in the 957 GB hard drive?
Also, is there anyway to permanently remove the first Ubuntu installation?</p>

Say for example the email:  <code>example@gmail.com</code> &amp; <code>examplegmail.com@ff.com</code><br>
The email <code>example@gmail.com</code> should get deleted, but the another emails should not. The above command is deleting both the instances which is not good. How I can avoid it?</p>

1: using a direct path instead of a link, 2:</p>

<p>3: making the array directly doesn't use subfolders</p>

"726642","How to pick the right Ubuntu version for ASrock Rack C2750D4I","<p>could you tell me what is the best option for Ubuntu to install on <a href=""http://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=C2750D4I#Specifications"" rel=""nofollow"">AsRock Rack C2750D4I</a>, as they say in the speck 12.04/12.10 x64 Bit, I've already run to the following conclusions:</p>

<p>It must be 64 bit. ( amd64 ) I've got 8 GB of Ram DDR3 1600
It must be a ""server"" version with open-box as a GUI</p>

<p>The dilemmas:</p>

<p>1.Does the 32 bit software run on 64 bit Ubuntu as compared to Windows?  </p>

<p>2.As the speck says 12.04/12.10 (x64) and the Ubuntu site says (14.04.3)<br>
  Which 64 bit ( amd64 ) Ubuntu is the best for my machine:  </p>

<p>12.04    Network installer:<br>
  12.04.5  Ubuntu 12.04.5 Server (64-bit) Via torrent file<br>
  12.10    Available only for ARM based processors (mine is not ARM):<br>
  14.04.3  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Server (64-bit): Found on the download page:<br>
  15.10    Ubuntu Server 15.10: Also on the download page:  </p>

<p>Though I will indeed skip the PAE because:<br>
 1. My board can run Ubuntu x64<br>
 2. It is also quite new<br>
 3. PAE will slow it down compared to the native 32 bit OS<br>
 4. <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/77987/Intel-Atom-Processor-C2750-4M-Cache-2_40-GHz"" rel=""nofollow"">C2750</a> is a native 64 bit CPU with PAE supported  </p>

<p>Tell me guys what do you think ...</p>

<p>Yesterday, I installed <strong>18.04.2 LTS</strong> on my personal computer, the minimal version.</p>

<p>Today, I tried accessing Netflix using Google Chrome, <strong>version 72.0.3626.121 (Official Build) (64-bit)</strong> and Firefox, <strong>version 65.0.1 (64-bit)</strong>.</p>

<p>However, no matter what I do, I keep getting this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Netflix Site Error. We were unable to process your request. Please go to the Netflix home page by clicking the button below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, I did my best to search this issue and found a few answers, which unfortunately, did not fixed my problem.</p>

<p>Here are the things that I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>DRM is enabled in my Firefox settings</li>
<li>I have installed the <strong>libavcodec-extra</strong> package through the commands provided here: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/1030432/netflix-doesnt-work-since-installing-ubuntu-18-04"">Netflix doesn&#39;t work since installing Ubuntu 18.04</a></li>
<li>I have installed the <strong>ubuntu-restricted-extras</strong> package as suggested here: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/1042947/netflix-not-working-on-firefox-60-0-1-64-bit-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts"">Netflix not working on Firefox 60.0.1 64-bit on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I know, Netflix should work natively on Google Chrome. In my case, it doesn't. As I was writing, I quickly installed Opera and tried accessing Netflix, but ran into the same issue.</p>

<p>I'm running out of ideas. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Later edit</strong>
After some updates, Netflix has started working again. No idea why though or if the updates had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>When I hit OK I think gparted went to HD I guess and when I tried to go gparted live it was running from HD and not my usb like supposed to. </p>

"728106","*OpenIMSCore* Fail to restart bind9 in the installation step","<p>I have problem in installing the OpenIMSCore. I use ubuntu in VM Machine and followed the following posts to install OpenIMSCore <a href=""http://www.ims-way.com/2011/04/open-ims-first-install/"" rel=""nofollow"">Installing an IMS network heart</a>. I went through all the first steps and now getting stuck at the step configuring DNS Configuration. I follow instructions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**An example of a DNS zone file is present in the installation directory openIMS. Copy it into your DNS configuration directory:
  ser_ims cp / cfg / open-ims.dnszone / etc / bind /</p>
  
  <p>Edit named.conf.local (still in / etc / bind /) to reflect this new
  zone (add the following lines): area ""open-ims.test""  {type master; 
  file  ""/etc/bind/open-ims.dnszone"";};</p>
  
  <p>Check that the named.conf to do well call this file. For this, the
  following line must be present in the named.conf: include
  ""/etc/bind/named.conf.local""; Add it if it does not.</p>
  
  <p>Edit the file /etc/resolv.conf, delete (or comment on) the existing
  content and add the following lines: search ims.test  open-domain
  open-ims.test  nameserver 127.0.0.1</p>
  
  <p>Note: At each reboot of the OS, this file will be overwritten by the
  Network Manager. So, make a backup of the file (we will use in our
  script automatically launch servers, we will see at the end of this
  tutorial): cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.ims</p>
  
  <p>Edit the file / etc / hosts file and add the following lines:
  127.0.0.1 localhost 
  127.0.0.1 open ims.test mobicents.open-ims.test ue.open ims.test  presence.ope-n-ims.test icscf.open-ims.test scscf.open-ims.test 
  pcscf. open-ims.test hss.open-ims.test</p>
  
  <p>Warning: As before, make a backup of this file: cp / etc / hosts
  /etc/hosts.ims</p>
  
  <p>Restart the DNS server: /etc/init.d/bind9 restart. Check that the
  configuration change has been taken into account (via dig): open-dig
  ims.test**</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when I restart the bind9, it show the failed error that I can not restart. Are there anyone have an idea how to get through this step?</p>

<p>I don’t feel confident about reviewing code and updating to the new version of ntp 4.2.8p4 myself. At the same time, I would like the packages to remain installed so that when future updates become available in the repos, I will be notified by Software Updater.</p>

<p>So my question is <strong>not</strong> ""How to update?"" <strong>nor</strong> “How to uninstall?”, but rather how do I simply disable or ‘turn off’ both ntpd and ntpdate, so they do not ever run or log any activity, without uninstalling them?” </p>

<p><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/29663/how-do-i-disable-ntpd"">How do I disable ntpd?</a> suggest I can simply prevent ntpd running at all using</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-rc.d -f ntp remove

<p>and prevent ntpdate running at all by adding <code>exit 0</code> to <code>/etc/default/ntpdate</code>.</p>

<p>However, I do not know how/where in the file to place the line <code>exit 0</code>. </p>

<p>Do I just use an editor like vi or nano to write in <code>exit 0</code> on any line without a <code>#</code> comment symbol, and it will be interpreted by the system correctly?  Can someone please confirm / elaborate on this solution?</p>

<p>1) Kaffeine does sort of work, sometimes, but you have to start each track (from the file browser showing Audio Disc files named TrackN.wav), but it plays only that track and then stops, necessitating going on to the next track by hand.  Seems to be disc-dependent as to whether it plays or not.</p>

<p>2) Other options in the menu of Recommended Applications are Videos and WinAmp, but neither at all.</p>

<p>3) From the Software Center I also tried the CD Player and KsCD.  After installation they do not show up in the Recommended Applications list.  These apparently must be launched from the command line, but in any case don't play at all.</p>

<hr>

<p>I find relevant information in the installation guide:</p>

<p>If you currently have one hard disk with one partition (a common setup for desktop computers), and you want to multi-boot the native operating system and Ubuntu, you will need to:</p>

<pre><code>Back up everything on the computer.

Boot from the native operating system installer media such as CD-ROM or tapes.

Use the native partitioning tools to create native system partition(s). Leave either a place holder partition or free space for Ubuntu.

Install the native operating system on its new partition.

Boot back into the native system to verify everything's OK, and to download the Ubuntu installer boot files.

Boot the Ubuntu installer to continue installing Ubuntu.
</code></pre>

<p>So I will try to find information on how to do that if some knows where I can find a step-by-step guide I will be grateful (or any other suggestion)</p>

<p>or by using the command</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It says that the package eclipse is not installed so not removed.But I did install Eclipse.

To add the workspace to your ROS environment you need to source the generated setup file:</p>

<pre><code>$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: What is this particular syntax for sourcing? Shouldn't we use the source command? As far as I know, . refers to the current directory. Thanks in advance.</p>

<li>disabled fast startup and hibernate in win 10</li>
<li>did a shrink volume in win, creating about 140gb of unallocated space</li>

<li>selected ""try ubuntu""</li>
<li>opened gparted, and was only able to see the 29gb usb drive where the install iso is located</li>
<li>hit the install ubuntu icon</li>
<li>selected ""install alongside windows boot manager""</li>
<li>install process went normally from there. </li>
</ul>

<p>But now, when I boot into the system it just goes to win10. There is no grub menu, and no ubuntu option in bios. </p>

<h2>System Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>HP Probook 470 G3</li>
<li>AMD Radeon R7 M340 (1 or 2 GB DDR3 dedicated, switchable)</li>

<hr>

<h2>Some additional notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I think getting the <code>amdgpu-pro</code> driver to work could solve the problem, as the freezes seem to be related to the graphics card power management. The notebook uses a hybrid graphics system and the crashes always seem to occure when the cards switch (for example it always crashes on logout or when you attach / detach a secondary monitor)</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <code>amdgpu-pro</code> driver and starting the session with <code>startx</code> command instead of using <code>lightdm</code> service directly, i found some errors in <code>Xorg.0.log</code> that match with the errors mentioned in <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/860788/undefined-symbol-is64bitelf"">this thread</a>, which sadly wasn't ever answered.</p>

"1203354","efibootmgr - Add FreeBSD to 3 Linux Installed Drive","<p>First of all, sorry for my English :)</p>

<p>I've read a lot of posts on internet but i cannot solve how to add an OS to UEFI boot list. I've recently installed FreeBSD 12 on my laptop.</p>

<p>Here is my laptop's state</p>

<ul>
<li>Lenovo T430 + UEFI + Secure Boot Off </li>
<li>3 Drive, GPT (1 SSD for Windows - 1 mSATA SSD for Linux - 1 HDD for Data) </li>
<li>On mSATA = Ubuntu (main OS) + Kali + openSUSE (experimental OS) + FreeBSD</li>
</ul>

<p>I normally press F12 (before first UEFI entry loads itself) to choose which OS i need to open, but after installing FreeBSD it didn't create its entry on UEFI by itself. As i searched, we can add OSes to UEFI Boot list by ""efibootmgr"".</p>

<p>My question is how can add FreeBSD to UEFI Boot List by efibootmgr ? I will be glad if someone can guide me.</p>

<p>Here is my lsblk and efibootmgr results. sdc7 is EFI partition of FreeBSD and sdc8 is / drive of it.</p>

<p>As you can see i have 2 EFI partition on same drive. FreeBSD created its own EFI drive and that's why i need to point this partition at command that i will wrote.</p>

<p>Will this command work ? Since i have 2 EFI partition on same drive, I use -p option instead of -d as everyone wrote on internet. I just don't want to corrupt UEFI with wrong command.</p>

<p>Do i need to run any more commands before run this command ?</p>

"739669","CMS not accessible on home server 14.04","<p>I've setup a server at home with Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS to develop and experiment on for our Magento webshop. The server itself runs fine when contacted from the internal network. 
I got magento to load under 1s so everything runs fine. </p>

<p>However now i switch a lot between locations and would like to keep to work on the installation form an external point.</p>

<p>When i call the server by IP nothing loads... when i remove the CMS and place a static HTML page it loads fine. However when i put the CMS (magento store in this case) back  and try to reach it nothing works.</p>

<p>I had Apache2 configured to listen to 2417 instead of 80 (my router blocks it), and setup a port forward.</p>

<p>After some googling i cannot come up with a solution and hope you guys can steer me in the right direction :)</p>

<p>If i have left out needed information please ask and i'll fill in (Kind of new to the external home server setup... )  </p>

<p>UPDATE:
I've just performed a clean install to start from scratch, Apache2 has been configured to listen to 2417.</p>

<p>Firewal is inactive</p>

<p>Do i need to set other components like MySQL to listen to another port also to make te CMS accessible from the outside?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!
Kind regards,

<p>When was prompted just said ""i"" to all prompts System did a reboot and from there entered ""ls"" to make sure files where still there.</p>

<p>But web pages will not show in browser instead I get the ""default page"" I have tried to redirect the apache to the new file location ""located at /var/www/html/index.html"" but I don't think I am doing it correctly like I said I'm no good with command line </p>

<p>There is no admin he got canned and will not respond </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>OK So I am guessing I now need to get the Apache to point to the html files (instead of the directory of the apache tree where it does now) </p>

<p>What do I need to enter in order for this to happen? How do I get apache to redirect to the apache2.conf.dpkg-old file or copy the contents into apache2.conf ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>Big Problem....!!!!</p>

<p>Now the web page has gone down It now says ""This webpage is not available"" </p>

<p>The web page is the main source of income and I may well lose my job if I don't ""fix"" this so I will need a step-by-step on how to change:</p>

<p>1.The document root that has moved from /var/www to /var/www/htm</p>

<p>Or</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Move the code down to /var/www/html</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>OK so after editing text file using: sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</p>

<p>I tried to ""restart"" apache I get this: * The apache2 configtest failed. Output of config test was: AH00526: Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Invalid command 'bash:', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration Action 'configtest' failed. The Apache error log may have more information. What does this mean? How do I fix it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4</strong></p>

<p>Got the apache working again</p>

<p>However now when I try to navigate to host page in web browser I am greeted with the root table I can navigate to html/ file  but am greeted with the ""404 not found page"" on 3 of the webpages and the ""default apache ubuntu"" page on the other one.</p>

<p>1 How do I fix?
2 What are the steps to do this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 5</strong></p>

<p>Managed to figure that sites needed to be reregistered and new certs given to upload them (they are all joomla sites) </p>

<p>Could it be that the php is not doing what it is meant to?
If so do I just update it (PHP will need to be 5.6 as higher will not work with where sites are hosted)</p>

<p>im sure its because of changing the mount point, i done it back and forth, and it always have the same effect. one thing though, if i change it back to defaults, /mnt/-longnumber-/ it first takes a super slow reboot and then it boots like it should</p>

"978479","How to use ssh to remotely signal a Ubuntu 16.04 system to speak out audible alerts without using incron","<p>Brief:  The question is about whether I should modify my Ubuntu 16.04 system to accomplish a task, or is there an easier way.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a complex system of computers, involving a mix of languages and operating systems.  </p>

<p>After setting up the Ubuntu 16.04 primary system for the solar plant to speak, as per:</p>

<p><a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/977613/16-04-lts-how-to-make-the-system-announce-the-time-at-the-top-of-the-hour-with-e/977614#977614"">16.04 LTS How to make the system announce the time at the top of the hour with eSpeak</a></p>

<p>EXCERPT:   Use <code>espeak</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install espeak
</code></pre>

<p>the next step is then to find a way for the remote data-logging systems (8 screens, generated mostly by Ubuntu 16.04 desktops and a Rpi3B) to command the primary Ubuntu 16.04 control system to verbally speak out alerts.  </p>

<p>They all are running Python programs to do the logging and sending data to the Prime Ubuntu control system for archiving, image manipulation and uploading to the web hosting service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current data plots are created on the Prime Ubuntu 16.04 system using <code>montage</code> in <code>Imagemagick</code> to format the plots which can be seen here:  <a href=""https://www.SDsolarBlog.com/montage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.SDsolarBlog.com/montage</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>To get voice alerts, the first attempt was to have them simply use <code>scp</code> to update a file in a directory and have the Ubuntu system detect the change to a file and respond by running a script that uses <code>espeak</code> to announce, for example, that a low-voltage condition exists.  All the systems use RSA passwordless logins, so doing the copy is simple.</p>

<p>The go-to-tool for monitoring file and directory changes is <code>incron</code> - which is similar to <code>cron</code> except that it triggers based on file system events instead of the clock.</p>

<p>Here is the info on using <code>incron</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2014/158/Monitoring-with-incron"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Monitor file and directory activity with incron</a></p>

<p>EXCERPT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start with installing <code>incron</code> and <code>inotify-tools</code> on the Ubuntu 16.04 control system.**</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install incron
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
sudo apt-get autoremove
</code></pre>

<p>then use <code>incrontab -e</code> to set up a simple entry like so:</p>

<pre><code>/home/me/alarms IN_CREATE /home/me/alarms/saylow24
</code></pre>

<p>where the contents of <code>/home/me/scripts/saylow24</code> are</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
espeak ""Low Voltage on 24""
sleep 10
espeak ""Low Voltage on 24""
</code></pre>

<p>...so the indoor Ubuntu 16.04 data logger can command the Prime console to speak out a voice alert when the 6 kWh battery bank falls below a threshold voltage.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then I began to set up a similar script for the outside data logger for the solar panel positioning system, which has its own separate PV panel and battery.  Cloudy days are a killer for it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>At that point I stopped and asked myself whether I really wanted to add the extra complexity of using the <code>incron</code> daemon on the Ubuntu 16.04 console at all.  I prefer things to be simple.</strong></p>

<p>Question:  Is there an easier way to do this without having to make major changes to Ubuntu?</p>

installed on the same physical ssd, just other partitions.<br>
i have others hdds, but not for data, not for boot.</p>

<p>a few weeks ago, while loging off ubuntu it showed a read/write error on sda4 (thats where linux is) then crashed.<br>
it made it a few times over the weeks till last monday.<br>
that day, grub asks me what system to boot. i choose ubuntu, then it went black, reboot screen bios and straight to ubuntu.</p>

<p>and yesterday, it didnt do anything.
no grub nothing.
i pluged off all my other hhds, then checked bios. bios sees the remaining ssd, had good temperature, everything normal. then restart.
and this time, it went straight to win7.
i made a checkdisk in there but nothing wrong.
and no way to go back to ubuntu.
and it crashed one more time in there while doing something. going to bootscreen and freezing there.</p>

<p>does that sound like an ssd fail to you ? or do you smell something else ?</p>

"822518","new install of 16.04 boots 3.13.0-96 despite the fact it isn't even present on any mounted filesystem","<p>A fresh installation of 16.04 from the mini.iso. After the basic installation I used apt-get to install xorg, openbox, thunar and so on, set some groups, and reset the tty font. No DM. No DE other than Openbox itself. I'm using LILO because the OS-prober bugs that affect grub2 were such a nightmare in a system with lots of installed OSs, including some on external media that might or might not be present. I'll go back to grub2 when I'm just short of suicidal desperation, so let's not go there if we can avoid it.  I've seen discussions of similar problems with grub2 also, but none of the solutions worked for me. This seems to be an example of a common class of similar problems with 16.04 specifically. LILO works fine for 3 installations of variations of 14.04 and a Win something (7 I think - I only booted it a time or 2), but on a new installation of 16.04 it boots showing a pleasantly large, multicolored font in tty7 and hangs after this output:
""started update UTMP about system runlevel changes""
Sometimes before, sometimes after that, there will be the output
""getty@ttyN.service"" where N is an integer from 1 - 6, inclusive.
I'm not sure N is consistent. Sometimes this message is repeated with other values of N, the other integers from 1-6. I think that's only if I access those ttys with cntrl-alt-FN. Maybe 16.04 is trying to start an x session even though I haven't told it to yet and for some reason fails at this step. Would that account for it being focused on tty7, while what looks like a normal non-graphical boot is taking place in tty1?
Anyway, after that hangs, I find in tty1, what appears to be, as far as I can tell, the end of a normal non-graphical boot process, with a login prompt. I can login normally. Startx works normally. It didn't at first but that was because ~/.Xauthority was owned root:root, which I fixed. In fact, everything I've checked seems to work pretty normally except it's the wrong kernel. I've confirmed this with both:
uname -r
&amp;
cat /proc/version
.
The oddest thing is that 3.13.0-96 isn't present anywhere I'd expect this sytem to be able to access. Mount shows only the / partition mounted. Fstab only tells it to mount that one partition. I'm not useing a swap or a boot partition. /boot contains only the 4 series kernels you'd expect. So unless it is hiding it somewhere else in the filesystem, it must be mounting one of the other partitions long enough to at least read the 3.13.0-96 kernel, but mount doesn't show that.
At one point I thought this was because I had some sytems using a common boot partition and others using a boot directory and that this was confusing LILO, specifically meaning the lilo command, which reads /etc/lilo.conf, and apparently resolves the symlinks like vmlinuz in the root directories of filesystems and stores whatever their target is somewhere. I assume that because I have entries pointing at the symlinks in addition to some pointing at specific kernels and the ones that point at the symlinks don't work after a kernel update until I run lilo, and then they work.
Anyway, I changed that, changed all the fstabs, copied the stuff in the boot partition to the boot directories on the systems that needed it, deleted the boot partition, ran lilo, and everything works fine on the 3 14.04s but still the 16.04 boots the 14.04 kernel.</p>

<p>This is about the eleventy-seventh time I've installed 16.04. If nobody has the solution to this, I may try once more, and check out in detail how it behaves before I install anything. But I'm about ready to give up on it. Thanks for reading. Any ideas would be appreciated. Even half-baked ones, because I've run through all my reasonable and half-baked ideas and am working on raw ones. &lt;|;-)</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Some places like this, people set great store by ""points"" or some such, and answering your own question is regarded as cheating, or rude. So, I'm not doing that. What's the custom here??
Anyway, I solved this. So often articulating a problem clarifies your thinking on it, and I guess that is what happened. So, am I supposed to tell, for the benefit of people finding this from a search engine? Or leave it for someone to score points with? Or wait 24 hours or something?</p>

I decided to get rid of windows and install <strong>Ubuntu 16.04</strong> . when attempted I chose something else and I chose to format the first partition to <strong>ext4 and mounted it to /</strong> and chose to <strong>format</strong> it. I also made a <strong>960MB swap</strong> partition. <strong>I didn't connect my laptop to Internet</strong> during the installation. my device is <strong>Lenovo y50 with 256GB SSD hard drive</strong>. Then I had so many problems after installation then and I did the process so many time I guess one of the times I used <strong>BIOS</strong> instead of <strong>UEFI</strong> and then every time I had the error <em>failed to install grub2 package to /target etc</em> so I found somewhere that I should make a <strong>200MB fat32 partition with boot flag</strong>. and I did and I finally could install my Ubuntu then whenever I wanted to install something I had a similar issue to <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/763472/what-can-i-do-to-fix-this-error-on-grub-efi/763746"">this</a>. So i ran this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/modinfo.sh /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/modinfo.sh
</code></pre>

<p>And then I started to have this new error:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So what should I do!? I'm really sick of this issue!
Is there anyway I could completely unistall grub2 and reinstall it again?
Is it safe and easy to use <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boot-repair</a>?
Where can I find the moddep.lst file!?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I ran:</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /boot/grub/i386-pc/* /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/

<p>Now I get the following error:</p>

<p>I am relatively new in Linux, but I supposed that there are some problems with tox, qtox rests, installation problems, incomplete removal, whatever.
So I used Bleachbit and Stacer to clean the system, apt-get purge and apt-get autoremove, but without any result.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering is there an app that cleans reminiscences of a removed program ? An uninstaller or system cleaner similar to CCleaner and Revo Uninstaller in Windows ?
Are Stacer and Bleachbit the only maintenance programs or is there something else, even better ? 
How can I get rid of that tox/qtox junk ?</p>

<p>I have this netbook at home, wich i got it by a government program about 5 years ago. The net has 300gb disc, 2gb ram, intel Atom 32-bit, had partition with Linux Mint 13, other with Windows 7, and the recovery system based in Debian (5.0.7).
I have more computers at home, including my own desktop pc, and i wasn't using this net too much, so i tried to install in Lubuntu 18.10 (32 bit). Is not the first time i try install an O.S., i've already done it with my desktop pc and other 4 units at home, and everything was done successfully.</p>

<p>The problem with this one started when i finished the first installation. I've installed by making partitions manually with the installer (by a live cd booteable usb and following the steps suggested by Lubuntu's page), 'cause the other two options that this gave me was to install replacing one of the s.o. or install it next to any of them.
Then the installation finished successfully and it asked me to reboot the system. I accepted. The PC restarted and the only thing that marked me was ""boot failed"". Then i restarted again and the net stands in something like a hard drive selector in the bios <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Qgz2Z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">asking me for select a hard drive</a></p>

<p>In this particular case, I'm not directly using the UEFI boot manager other than having it load GRUB2 both because the system in question doesn't provide the option of a menu with a timeout (you have to hit F12 to get a boot menu, and it sits there until you select something), and because I want passwords on some boot options but not others (and Windows is one of the things I want a boot password for).  I would like to keep this setup and integrate Ubuntu into it, instead of having to deal with the (crappy) UEFI boot manager interface when I want to boot Ubuntu, which in turn means I need a way for Ubuntu to not mess with the UEFI boot manager variables (fighting with Windows every time it gets upgraded to a new build is bad enough without another OS contending for control).</p>

<p>Based on what I've seen so far it looks like the only way to do this is to do a non-EFI install of Ubuntu, and then pull in the <code>grub-efi</code> package manually (and probably do some trickery to keep <code>efibootmgr</code> from being run).  Is there any other way to do this without needing to create a custom installer or custom <code>grub-efi</code> package?</p>

<pre><code>#
# Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
#
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""foo.log""
# with ServerRoot set to ""/etc/apache2"" will be interpreted by the
# server as ""/etc/apache2/foo.log"".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation (available
# at &lt;URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mpm_common.html#lockfile&gt;);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
#ServerRoot ""/etc/apache2""

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#
Mutex file:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR} default

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
# This needs to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
#
PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to ""Off"" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.

# if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.
# If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, ""text/plain"" is
# a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications
# or images, you may want to use ""application/octet-stream"" instead to
# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.
#
# It is also possible to omit any default MIME type and let the
# client's browser guess an appropriate action instead. Typically the
# browser will decide based on the file's extension then. In cases
# where no good assumption can be made, letting the default MIME type
# unset is suggested  instead of forcing the browser to accept
# incorrect  metadata.
#
DefaultType None

# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people

"984495","Is it necessary to mount ESP at boot?","<p>I recently dual-booted my laptop, installing Ubuntu 16.04 beside an existing install of Windows 7 (on separate hard disks).  For convenience/curiosity, I also spent some time messing around with files and settings until I could boot the Ubuntu install as a VM in VirtualBox with raw disk access.  In order to do this, I had to create an ESP on the second hard disk with copies of the Ubuntu files from the original ESP, and well as removing (commenting out) the fstab entry that mounted the primary/original ESP (without commenting it out, VM Ubuntu would only boot into recovery mode).  </p>

<p>My main question is whether not mounting the (any) ESP could cause issues with programs expecting it to be there etc. (I ran apt upgrade earlier today and it printed that if found and updated files on /dev/sda1 (the original ESP))</p>

<p>The second question is whether having 2 separate ESPs could break updates etc. Right now the /EFI/ubuntu/* files are copied exactly, including grub.cfg which just points to /boot/grub.cfg anyway.  I'm trying to be careful not to run any updates while booted as a VM, but accidentally started one earlier today and CTRL-C'ed it to stop.</p>

<p>Basically, I've hacked/googled my way to a system that works but I want to make sure that I haven't broken important things along the way.</p>

I have so far tried:</p>

<p>1.(?=.*word1)(?=.*word2)
2. word1.*word2 </p>

<p>Both of them failed to exlcude the word that I don't want. Basically I want the resultant set to not consist of those messages that would have word3 along with word1 and word2 but want the resultant set to have either word1 or word2. </p>

"1145196","Extracting embedded images from a PDF results in tiny stripes","<p>I have an important pdf where I need to extract the source image, as lossless as possible (e.g. using png)
For some reason, it seems that the source image is made out of 226 image stripes, and when I extract these e.g. with </p>

<pre><code>pdfimages -png name.pdf out-
</code></pre>

<p>I get the 227 tiny stripes. That is not what I want. Is there a way to get one single image instead? Using <em>pdfimages -list</em> tells me the info about the stripes, and using e.g. the above <em>pdfimages -png name.pdf out-</em> gives me the 227 single images. One image is e.g. 1604 px width and 5 px height. So far as I checked them, all images seem to be 5 px height, and with 227 single images, I should get one single image of 1604 x 1135 px instead.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I forgot to add what Ryan J. Yoder wrote below was also my own thought on the issue, meaning that the pdf was indeed created by splitting the original image into 227 stripes.</p>

<p>And in conclusion, if that is so (<em>pdfimages -list</em> says it is so) is there a way to automatically create one single image out of the stripes e.g. by using graphicsmagick.</p>

I am used to use the browser with my profile signed in, thus, all my data is synchronized with other devices.</p>

<p>I have recently updated the browser version and suddenly it started to crash with the following problem:</p>

<p>When I close the browser, I cannot open it anymore (it doesn't show any screen).
I start by clicking on the chrome icon and I see various processes starting (i see it on htop), and all of them consumes about 0.9% of CPU, but the browser screen does not show.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have the same config in another computer (ubuntu 14.04 with the same chrome version) and it works normally. (with the same account and with a different account too)</p>

<hr>

<p>Researching a little in some forums, I found a suggestion about deleting the directory <code>~/.config/google-chrome/</code>.</p>

<p>When I delete this directory, the browser shows up normally.</p>

<p>But there is a detail: if I use it without signing in, it works like a charm (I can close it and open again, everything goes smoothly, the screen shows every time).
But if I sign in using some account, the problem happens (I have tried with more than one: I started by trying using the same account in both computers; then, I tried with a different account in the computer with problems, and the problem was the same). If I close it, I cannot open the browser window anymore, unless I delete the folder <code>~/.config/google-chrome/</code> (and thus, all my loaded data is deleted too, all my synced data, and this way I have to login again and wait for the synchronization process to complete).</p>

<p>EDIT from comment: The problem occurs with any user logged in (not only my current one)</p>

<p>EDIT: The version of the chrome browser I am using is 63.0.3239.108 (Official Version) in both computers (the one it works and the one it doesn't).</p>

<p>what i have tried so far</p>

<pre><code>cat ~/bin/elink 
elinks -auto-submit http://192.168.1.2:9088/WISHN/Login.jsp

<p><strong>by running this command it auto logs me in (by editing ~/.elinks/elinks.conf)</strong></p>

<p>but it just stays there untill user interacts and exits the app but pressing <strong>""q""</strong></p>

<p>thats why this script does not work</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
while [ 1 -eq 1 ]
  do
    . ~/bin/elink
    slleep 3
    pkill-9 elinks
    sleep 5

<p>this does not works too nothing happens</p>

<pre><code>./abcd.sh '{\""type\"":\""path\"",\""key\"":[]}'

<p>However, I seem to be unable to pass the character sequence in such a way that abcd.sh is called correctly from within keepAbcdRunning....</p>

"752433","Problem to log in in to a new instralled Ubuntu","<p>I have read the answers on the same question, but I couldn't find the answer.
I have installed complete new Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS on my Sony Vaio, but I can't log in.
I have try with different passwords - log and shorts - but it always comes back to the log in screen.
To be possible to check some things I had to add my user and pass - after pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 - and it works.
But when I try to log in is writing not my user, but my name - maybe this is the problem. How can I change it?</p>

<p>I have try to check ownership for some files - stays my name on the side.
I have move the cache - the same.</p>

<p>Some other ideas?</p>

<p>The type of the laptop is Sony Vaio VPCEB4J1E</p>

<p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>I referred to <a href=""https://smyl.es/how-to-fix-ubuntudebian-apt-get-404-not-found-package-repository-errors-saucy-raring-quantal-oneiric-natty/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, then I realized that since my version 16.04 LTS, so it's still supported, and it's not the problem.</p>

<p>I also read <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/q/416930/"">this question</a>, but both answers can't be applied to my case (<code>apt-get update</code> fails and <code>xenial-security</code> is present in <code>http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/</code>).</p>

<p>Next, I visited the URL <a href=""http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/curl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/curl</a>, and I figured out that <strong><em>curl_7.47.0-1ubuntu2.13_amd64.deb</em></strong> is there instead of <strong><em>curl_7.47.0-1ubuntu2.12_amd64.deb</em></strong>, which is being requested by <code>apt-get</code>. As a result, I deduce that <code>apt-get</code> should ask for <code>2.13</code> rather than <code>2.12</code>, hence the title. </p>

<p>However, I am kind of stuck here. I am not sure what I should do next to resolve this issue, and I appreciate any advice.</p>

<p>My intention was to dual boot windows 7 and Ubuntu. I needed more space for the OS, so I messed with the partitioning etc.</p>

<p>I wanted to erase Windows 7 for it. I erased all partitions and created one for home, another for something else and the main one following a video which I can't find and don't remember well. It said reboot to complete installation, and I did. </p>

<p>But now when I boot up my pc it seems I erased my operating system and it won't let me boot Ubuntu, it just shows me the keys i can press for bios etc and after that it just goes to a black screen with a flashing cursor top left that's not interactive.</p>

<p>When I press F9 for diagnosics it says i pass everything but Boot test and it gives me an error code that is ""BIOHD3"" and it gives me a warning saying no active partitions. Now my brother loaded up ubuntu on one of his flash drives for me and booted it off of that. It has mostly errors as shown below. </p>

<p>The journalctl command... the log is so lengthy as to be nearly useless.  I've no idea where its finding references to the users it seems to has listed there... the bottom line error seems to be an authentication failure which... is weird to me since... hey this is a process running on the server BY the server... what exactly would be logging into WHAT at this point... just to start that service.  But aside my own ignorance on that, I don't know where to add/change said users... looking into things like the PAM authentication list I see exactly none of the users being mentioned in the journal here so... changing anything there would not likely make any difference.</p>

<p>Anyway during update it was mentioned several files that were possibly newer and could be replaced by newer versions... except that the prior ones were modified by some script (or me) since their install so the default action was to keep the previous one.  I'm guessing that replacing one of those with a newer one might remedy this issue, but I have no idea where to start on finding what that is.  Anyway if anyone came across THIS issue or one similar that they can guide me towards a correction direction, I'd appreciate it.</p>

"908026","Weak wifi signal with Ubuntu 16.04 on Dell Vostro 5468, Intel wireless 3165","<p>My Dell has an Intel Wireless 3165. It is found during installation, and <code>dmesg</code> reports: </p>

<pre><code>iwlwifi 0000:02:00.0: enabling device (0000 -&gt; 0002)

iwlwifi 0000:02:00.0: Detected Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless AC 3165, REV=0x210
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if those first errors are normal, but it appears to find a useful one and then gets the wifi up running. However, when I start a download the speed is basically none, and in System Monitor I just see a few Kb spike in the curve every 30 seconds or so. </p>

<p>I go to <code>/etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf</code> and start by turning off 11n: </p>

<pre><code>options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1
#options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8
#options iwlwifi wd_disable=1
#options iwlwifi lar_disable=1
options iwlwifi power_save=0
#options iwlwifi bt_coex_active=0
#options antenna_coupling=0 
#options swcrypto=1
</code></pre>

<p>(The commented out lines are what I found in other suggestions for how to make it work, and I have tried them in different combinations, but no improvement. I have not found out what <code>antenna_coupling</code> actually does -- it is in dB so I hoped that it could adjust the strength of the antenna but that was of course wishful thinking. The <code>power_save</code> option does not seem to do anything, so I had to add a line in crontab to turn it off, which works.)</p>

<p>Now I can download at a somewhat normal speed. If I sit a meter away from the router I get 3 staples for the signal strength. If I move into the next room behind a wooden wall it stays at 3, but at 5 meters distance and behind another wooden wall, it goes down to 2 and dl speed goes to 0. Then I occasionally lose the wifi altogether. At the exact same spot I get 4 staples with Windows 10 on the same computer (and with my Macbook). </p>

<p>I tried with and without Bluetooth but that does not seem to change anything (I have a mouse that can run either Bluetooth or dongle, and with Bluetooth it sometimes hangs for a second or two). (The Intel 3165 card has Bluetooth integrated.) </p>

<p>I can live with no 11n (although it seems buggy that it is not supported by Ubuntu). But the signal strength issue is very real and should not be there. Does anyone know what else I can do to solve it?</p>

<p>I tried with a live Ubuntu 17.04 but same problem. </p>

<p>After the release of Ubuntu 16.04, I want to install Ubuntu again.
After successful installation of Ubuntu, it says restart. When I restart, then by default Windows loads, so I have to go to the boot menu and select Ubuntu hdd2 or Ubuntu hdd3. Then it shows me grub 2.02  console.</p>

<p>Methods I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>disabling all the secure boot stuff again</li>
<li>using easeus software</li>
<li>trying various Linux commands on the grub console screen.</li>

<p>Also, I didn't get the option while installation in Ubuntu to ""install alongside windows"" so I had to use those partition.</p>

<p>Online I read that I might get a new IP address if I change the Mac address.</p>

<p>So I tried to change the Mac address using the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

$ sudo macchanger -m 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0
</code></pre>

<p>what I got, was the following output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current MAC:   aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (unknown)<br>
  Permanent MAC: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (unknown)<br>
  [ERROR] Could not change MAC: interface up or insufficient permissions: Too   many open files in system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if I set the wifi adapter up again with:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
</code></pre>

<p>and then check for the mac adress with: </p>

<pre><code>$ sudo macchanger wlan0
</code></pre>

<p>the output i got was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current MAC:   00:11:22:33:44:55 (CIMSYS Inc)<br>
  Permanent MAC: 44:1c:a8:f9:bb:bd (unknown)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So apparently the mac address was changed even though I got an error message.</p>

<p>I know the mac address was definitely changed because I was also not able to connect to my wifi anymore (if I change back to the permanent one I can connect again). </p>

<p>Now my question:</p>

<p><strong>Can anybody tell me why I get an error message even though the mac address was changed?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your help and sorry if I didn't use the perfectly correct terms to describe everything. But I hope it is still understandable and else please ask and correct me.</p>

<p>Cheers, Baba Shrimp</p>

<p>First of all thanks a lot for your fast answer. </p>

<p>I checked for further information and found the Information for the Ethernet interface as well as for the wireless connection.     </p>

<p>But to be honest I have no idea what I should do with this information now? </p>

<p>Then I checked out the website of <code>macchanger</code> where I could find the zipped <code>macchanger</code> version 1.6.0 as well as the <code>pgp signature</code> which belongs to it. </p>

<p>So I downloaded both and tried to check for it's integrity. I never used gpg before so I tried to read into it. I tried to verify the integrity with:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --verify macchanger-1.6.0.tar.gz.sig  macchanger-1.6.0.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Which resulted basically in: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gpg: signature can not be verified: no public key. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I started looking for the public key of <code>macchanger</code> but didn't even came close to find infos about where I can find the key. I found how to import a key. But how import a key if you don't know where to import it from?</p>

<p><code>apt source macchanger</code> does not work because of the following ussue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Source package for macchanger can not be found</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for your last hint I don't even understand what <code>macchanger-1.7.0/src/netinfo.c</code></p>

<p>should be. So I think it is not necessary to mention that I have idea what code underneath it means. </p>

<p>I can understand if you have no interest in answering all this questions. So maybe you could just give me a better hint where to start with my research if I just want to learn something about how networks work?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot </p>

<p>It seems those 2 ports conflict each other in some sense but I don't know the cause and how to run both at the same time.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me what could be the cause and how to fix this (run both ports at the same time). Thanks in advance</p>

<p>the problem is, the input method setup is so difficult for me to understand that i am just twitching here and there without solid knowledge what does it do..  hence sometime it works, and sometime it does not work. google pinyin works for a few while, but it is not like what i like it to work as what i have used in windows google pinyin.. i tried to make it better, and as i said, i just twitching it here and there and at the end it is gone. 
hence i saw other person using ibus to do chinese input.. i also tried, but it does not work.. i have chinese input installed, but the output is just english character, same as english input.. </p>

"754436","Purging custom .deb package through script exits suddenly","<p>I am a developer, who sometime works on deployment related things. I am using <code>Jenkins</code> to auto-deploy my application to an <code>ubuntu 14.04</code> machine. My application is packaged as <code>.deb</code> and some supporting apps as <code>jar</code>. I have written a small shell script to do the installation of debian/jar. I am trying to purge my existing application and install the new one. But sometimes, the script gets exited while purging and the remaining steps are not executed. This is creating some issues for me since many times I have to login to the server and re-install and restart my application.
I am not getting any errors in the console while executing it, so not able to provide any more information. </p>

<p>Pasting my script here, can someone point out what is the possible issue in my script.</p>

<p>I opened openshot to edit my videos on Ubuntu 14.04. 
but when I tried to close it using <code>kill</code>(also tried pkill) command nothing happened. All other installed applications working properly as expected while trying to close them with <code>kill</code> command.</p>

<p>I even tried <code>kill</code> with <code>sudo</code>, but no use. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is <code>kill</code> not working on Openshot?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any known bug is behind this problem in Ubuntu's Openshot implementation?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE :</strong></p>

<p>As someone mentioned in comment , <code>kill -9</code> is working properly.
but why not  <code>kill</code> is not working ?</p>

<p>Somebody may think it as a duplicate for <code>kill</code> and <code>kill -9</code> commands.
 But my question is not about how to kill openshot. </p>

<p>My question is why is kill not working for openshot on Ubuntu?.
So please ensure before marking my this as duplicate.</p>

<p>In particular, why is OpenShots not working properly with kill? Is its implementation itself is like that or because of any bug?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried disabling Fast Boot and Secure Boot in the BIOS but i still had the problem</p></li>
<li><p>I tried the second option and pressed E on 'Try Ubuntu'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hi. I am using the right drivers from Linux
Lubuntu CPU is 80% to 100% on YT 4K video</p>

<p>on YouTube playing on 4K @60fps very high CPU
i tried h264ify still lag and very high CPU
tried different Internet browser, for example chrome, Firefox, Opera still lag and very high CPU.
tried patched chromium still lag very high CPU</p>

<p>i don't have this problem with windows 10 (64bit)
on windows 10 64bit CPU usage is 10% or 20% to 30% on YouTube 4K video 
all web browsers work excellent on windows 10, only problem is Memory (RAM) on windows 10</p>

<p>so that's why i tried Linux Lubuntu </p>

<p>any solution?</p>

I want it to work so that when you type, for example, the letter ""A"", it appears on screen (kinda like gedit/notepad/whatever). I am doing this by appending the letter to a string which then gets rendered and put onto the screen. However, I have problems with actually getting user input. I know that there is the pygame.key.get_pressed() function, but I can only figure out how to use it if you actually know what key you want the user to be pressing (for example W to go forward), but not if I don't know. If that is confusing, here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600,500))
myfont = pygame.font.Font(None, 60)
inp = """"

    inp = inp + #THE PRESSED KEY
    screen.fill((0,0,200))

<p>Is there any way to enable VT-d? Am i missing a kernel parameter?

"757401","Gnome causes system hang; Unity does not. How to locate problem?","<p>There's a bug in Gnome Shell, or possibly something beneath it (seems to apply to gdm, too) that causes a complete system lock up when I plug in an external monitor.</p>

<p>This does not happen when using Unity.</p>

<p>There aren't any logs because the system just locks up and has a blank screen. You can't get out with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>, nor with the special <kbd>SysRq</kbd> triggers.</p>

<p>That's the simple version of the diagnostic. The more complex bit is like:</p>

<pre><code>monitor  driver  de         result
-------- ------- ---------- -----------------------
internal intel   gnome      works
internal intel   unity      works
internal nvidia  gnome      works
internal nvidia  unity      works
external intel   gnome      massive crash
external intel   unity      Kernel buffer underrun
external nvidia  gnome      massive crash
external nvidia  unity      works
</code></pre>

<p>The buffer underrun I've <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1568865"" rel=""nofollow"">reported</a> against the kernel - the system was alive after, so I had the logs etc. But I'm not sure how to report the gnome problem.</p>

<h2>edit</h2>

<p>This got down voted because it sounded like the generic ""how to report a bug"". I suppose what I'm asking instead is: does anyone know of a library used by gnome and gdm that is not used by unity or lightdm, and that might be key to understanding where the fault lies? I was surprised that gdm fails, for example, and that led me to thing it's not a gnome shell issue...</p>

"993503","Is there a minimum compatible kernel version for each of the Ubuntu releases? Are older kernels compatible with newer Ubuntu releases?","<p>Usually, building latest stable Linux kernel from source using the current kernel-config and installing them have worked just fine. In case of <code>17.10 x86_64</code>, the latest <code>4.x</code> kernels have worked fine - they have been taken directly from <code>kernel.org</code>. Of late, I am experimenting with older kernels like <code>3.x</code> and <code>2.x</code>. In that, so far, only <code>3.18.90</code> has worked with 17.10 except it had some issues with dual monitors which is not an important issue - might be Nvidia driver compatibility with older/newer kernels. But, all other older kernel versions like <code>3.2.97</code>, <code>2.6.39</code>, etc have not worked - booting gets stuck with ""<code>.. Loading init ramdisk...</code>"" screen. Examining the <code>journalctl</code> output for the specific kernel boot log didn't reveal much apart from some <code>X11</code> issue and some <code>systemd</code> services not getting started or were terminated. After digging through several websites on such <code>X11</code> errors, I enabled the <code>VGA VESA framebuffer</code> support, <code>console framebuffer</code> options in kernel-config. Still nothing helped. By the way, I did reinstall Nvidia drivers as well for each of these kernels before booting them afresh. So, is there any <strong>minimum</strong> kernel version for each of the Ubuntu releases? Also, I need to add that I tried using one of the old ubuntu-12.04 LTS kernel config to see if it makes any difference - didn't change anything with respect to getting stuck at ""<code>Loading init ramdisk...</code>"" Any thoughts on these?</p>

"1072027","Insert a line of text after the line containing the last occurence of a specified word","<p>Basically, I want to insert a line of text after the line containing the last 
occurence of a specific string, without affecting the rest of the file.</p>

<p>I imagine I should proceed like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>delete all lines after the last occurrence of the specified word</li>
<li>append the desired string to the bottom of the file</li>
<li>append back the previously deleted part, right after the newly inserted line</li>
</ol>

<p>In my case, after the line containing the last occurrence of the specific word, there isn't any more text: just a certain number of empty lines and the special string <code>#EOF</code> on the very last line. It is important that this section is preserved, with exactly the same number of empty lines, and the <code>#EOF</code> tag intact.</p>

<p>This is a sample input file:</p>

<pre><code>First line
Second line
Third line 1
Third line 2
Third line N



#EOF
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of this example, I want to append a line with the text <code>Fourth line</code> right after the line containing the latest occurrence of the word <code>Third</code>. The result should be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>First line
Second line
Third line 1
Third line 2
Third line N
Fourth line



#EOF
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the number of newline characters after <code>Fourth line</code> stays the same as before.</p>

<p>Which command is the best one in this case? I tried the following but all the lines in the file were deleted and only <code>Fourth line</code> was appended.</p>

<pre><code>sed -e :a -e '/^\n*$/{$d;N;};/\n$/ba' file
echo -e ""\nFourth line\n\n\n#EOF"" &gt;&gt; file

<p>Nearly every game that is linux compatible that I run through the steam client crashes with no error dialog popping up, they all might crash but I haven't played all of them enough to see it occur as sometimes I can get 2hrs of gameplay in before crash but usually happens between 10-45 mins.</p>

<p>I ran Steam from terminal and started Dying light until it crashed and have attached the terminal output.</p>

<p>I have reached out to Nvidia, Steam, and a couple of the games tech support both claim to be unable to recreate the error or get a usable error code to indicate what is going on from my logs and the tech support has never responded.</p>

<p>I have used psensor to confirm nothing is overheating, highest temp was the video card at 71c, however the graphics sensor shows in psensor reaching 100%, I have reduced graphics to the lowest they can be which seems overkill since I am running a 980, and the graphics still reaches 100%.</p>

<p>The only game I have that doesn't crash ever is Xonotic, however it does not run through the Steam client, I can play Xonotic for hours and it never crashes or has any issues. </p>

"1073726","How to rename many files using info from a separate .txt file?","<p>I believe this problem can be solved with a bash script, but I'm still a beginner so I need your help here.</p>

<p>I have many files (about 8 million!) with names such as <code>IR.AZR..SHE.D.2016.001.000000.SAC</code>. The file names follow this format:</p>

<pre><code>IR.(stations name)..(component).D.(year).(day).000000.sac
</code></pre>

<p>They all need to be renamed to the following format:</p>

<pre><code>(station name).IR.(component).(year).(day).(begin time).(endtime).sac
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code>(day)</code> is in 365 format or maybe I should say it is in <strong>Julian day</strong> format.</p>

<p>The current file name, along with the additional information required for the new format, is stored in a plain text file:</p>

"1222680","¿How can I fix my main disk? (problem with Ubuntu 19.04 EFI and Windows 7)","<p>I have been trying to install <strong>Ubuntu 19.04</strong> together with Windows from a USB in an <strong>Acer Aspire Z3771 with Intel Core i3–2120 CPU @ 3.30 GHz and 6 GB of RAM on an external disk</strong> (to avoid problems with my internal disk). Before then I had installed <strong>Ubuntu 15.04</strong> and everything had worked fine except that since it's an old version I couldn't do anything (I couldn't update the packages) so that's why I decided to install a newer version.</p>

<p>When I installed the old version, I made a primary partition for <em>/boot</em> with 2GB. Then I made three logical partitions; one for <em>swap</em>, with 12GB, as I've been told that it should have twice the RAM capacity; one for <em>/home</em> with 436 GB; and another for <em>/(root)</em> with 50 GB. In both installation processes, I made the exact same partitions (except for the <strong>EFI partition</strong> in <strong>Ubuntu 19.04</strong>) and both times I followed the installation process (i.e. I didn't have the previously made partitions, but I made them at the time of installation).</p>

<p>The problem arose (I think) when the installer for <strong>Ubuntu 19.04</strong> asked if I wanted to proceed to install
without using an EFI partition ""because if you did so you probably wouldn't be able to boot the operating system"" (despite having done it without <strong>EFI partition</strong> with <strong>Ubuntu 15.04</strong>). That message
of warning left me wondering ""What if I can't access my <strong>Windows 7</strong> disk later because I can't use the <strong>Ubuntu GRUB</strong>?"" So I decided to make the <strong>EFI partition</strong> fearing I would lose access to the <strong>Windows 7</strong> disk. The irony is that this is exactly what happened when doing this with an <strong>EFI partition</strong>: I almost lost access to my hard drive with Windows 7; and I say almost because now I can only boot <strong>Windows 7</strong> from the <strong>boot menu</strong> that appears when I just start the PC.</p>

<p>If I try to start Ubuntu, I get a <strong>GRUB prompt</strong> —which I don't know how to use—. Also, I get disk dump descriptions on the disk that has <strong>Windows 7</strong>. Does it mean it is damaged?</p>

<p>How can I reboot from my <strong>Windows 7</strong> disk, as I did before?</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyway I would like someone to help me get Ubuntu 19.04 on my external hard drive without modifying anything on my other drive (the internal one with Windows 7).</p>

<p>I have tried to start the laptop holding the 'c' key down until the DVD drive starts and then release it but no luck. 
I also tried holding the 'option' key down and that gets me to a 'menu' with the only option to start from a hard drive named 'windows' (?) but no DVD drive option. If the hard drive is selected the system does not boot.</p>

<p>**pressing 'esc' during the boot process gets me to the grub menu and/or console. anything i can do from here? **</p>

<p>p.s. I also tried with another .iso CD that I know for sure works 
and did not get any results. 
so probably it's not the specific DVDisc that causes the problem.</p>

"1225354","FIND - how do you use -exec {} +?","<p>I'm learning the command <code>find</code>, and have a search that works, using <code>-exec cp {} \;</code>.  </p>

<p>THANK YOU FOR THE REPLIES.  THIS IS MY EDITED QUESTION:
(I hope this meets the formatting conventions.)</p>

<p>Below, I copied (with an extra line between command sets for legibility) a sequence of commands that show what I'm doing.</p>

<p>To summarize: </p>

<p>1) I started with a directory structure of test/testsub1/testsub2, with 3 files in test/ and 3 files in test/testsub1/; none in test/testsub1/testsub2/.  </p>

<p>2) I created 10000 files named filesub2-xxxxx in test/testsub1/testsub2/, and confirmed their existence with the next <code>ls</code> command.</p>

<p>3) I used the <code>find</code> command to locate the 10000 files and used the <code>-exec cp</code>{}<code>test/ \;</code> expression to copy them to test/.  Confirmation with the next <code>ls</code> command. </p>

<p>4) I removed the 10000 copied files from test/.  Confirmation with the next <code>ls</code> command.</p>

<p>5) Then I tried to use the exact same <code>find</code> command, except replacing the <code>;</code> with a <code>+</code>, with and without quoting and backslash, none of which 
worked.  (The last version addresses the suggestion below that '{}' should be in last position.) </p>

<p>Hence, my question.</p>

The boot files of [The OS now in use - Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS] are far from the start of the disk. Your BIOS may not detect them. You may want to retry after creating a /boot/efi partition (FAT32, 100MB~250MB, start of the disk, boot flag). This can be performed via tools such as gParted.

Then I try <strong>Ubuntu 18.04</strong> in the Virtualbox - also works fine. <strong>Lubuntu 18.04</strong> as well. But if I create the LiveUsb from these <code>.iso</code> files (I mean Linux distributions) and boot them on the real hardware, I get the same problem.</p>

<p>I have tried another distributions, non-Ubuntu based - <strong>Fedora 28</strong> and <strong>OpenSuse 15</strong> - no problem is observed. Neither in the VirtualBox, neither on the real hardware.</p>

<p><strong>My assumptions:</strong>
I think, the cause is the <code>mesa</code> library and have desire to compile the newer version from the source and test it. But it works on the <code>Virtualbox</code>, with the Virtualbox's video driver (<code>vboxvideo</code>). And it doesn't work with the <code>i915</code> driver on the real system... <strong>What do you think? Do someone have any thoughts about solution of this problem?</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.So my problem begin from the installation UBUNTU (doesn't matter the version i have tried with 18.04 and 20.04). That was impossible to install system because screen was freeze after few seconds. So I find solution in network:</strong></p>
<p>*Disable Fast Boot and Secure Boot (or Secure loader).</p>
<p>Plug in the bootable USB with the Linux distro (mine was Ubuntu 16.04)</p>
<p>When you see the loader to &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot; etc ... press &quot;e&quot; and edit a line: Replace &quot;quiet splash&quot; to &quot;nomodeset&quot; and press F10 to boot.</p>
<p>Then after the installation is complete, you will have to reboot. This time you will now encounter the GRUB. Again, press &quot;e&quot; and edit a line: In the line that starts with &quot;linux&quot;, add &quot;nouveau.modeset=0&quot; at the end of that line.
Your Linux should now boot.</p>
<p>After this, you need to install the nvidia drivers. Reboot. And then it's done.*
**</p>
<p><strong>2. Finally I was able to install system. After then I changed GRUB by another instruction:</strong></p>
<p>*If you require noveau.modeset=0 in order to boot properly, you could add an extra kernel boot parameter in the /etc/default/grub file so that you don't have to type it in (and can continue to use the open source nouveau drivers).</p>
<p>Boot up using your 'safe mode' solution and then open a terminal and use</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub
</code></pre>
<p>to change
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&quot;quiet splash&quot;
to be
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&quot;quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0&quot;</p>
<p>(press Ctrl + x to exit, y to confirm saving the changes and Enter to accept the filename)</p>
<p>If you then run <code>sudo update-grub</code> to update your changes, when you reboot it should work as if you'd typed that line in yourself each time.*</p>
<p><strong>3.After this steps everything is almost ok. BUT MY PROBLEM IS THAT I CANT INSTALL NVIDIA DRIVERS. I CAN'T CHANGE ANY GRAPHICS OPTION. SYSTEM DOESN'T SEE MY ADDITIONAL MONITOR (ITS NESESERY TO MY SCHOOL). I have tried to do it manually.</strong></p>

<pre><code>Do someone have solution for this?
</code></pre>

<p>edit:
after installing the util-440, the <code>nvidia-smi</code> is working and in that, it shows <code>gforce mx230 off</code> but  the gpu usage is never 0%. Also, <code>settings&gt;about system</code> shows <code>intel</code> and <code>prime-select query</code> shows <code>nvidia</code>.
the output of <code>nvidia-smi</code> : </p>

So I decided to dual boot my main pc running windows 7 and focal fossa yesterday. left all the partitioning up to ubuntu installer and im already out of space, it gave me 9gb. now im having difficulty booting ubuntu and getting loads of warnings about low disk space. </p>

<p>been in to windows disk manager and unallocated some space, made a bootable gparted usb which i cant get to run keep getting a message saying no bootable partition in table, then remembered i have a bootable usb that i installed ubuntu with(literally hours earlier).</p>

<p>so im on my live usb in gparted, and i cant resize the ubuntu partition, made a bit more unalocated space in gparted but still cant make my ubuntu partition any bigger.</p>

<p>Im trying to install ubuntu on the harddrive but im getting stuck when running the installation wizard on the step when it asks you to connect to the wifi or not (see image below). When I click continue the ""working"" mouse symbol appears but nothing happens. I waited for 20 minutes without getting any futher.</p>

<p>This is my first time trying to install linux so im not sure how it should usually go. This is what I have tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>created an bootable usb from ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso with rufus.</li>
<li>created an bootable usb from this release too Linux Mint 19.3 ""Tricia"" - Cinnamon (64-bit). Got stuck in the installation wizard the exact same way as before.</li>
<li>I have tried with different usb sticks but i always get stuck on the same step.</li>
</ul>

<p>Windows was installed before and when trying to boot you are getting this error when booting up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BlinitializeLibrary failed 0xc000000bb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some googling I found that you could try to write these commands in the command prompt.</p>

<pre><code>Bootrec / fixmbr
Bootrec / fixboot
Bootrec /rebuildbcd

<p>But I cant boot up windows from USB stick (I tried). I can boot up linux from USB, but cannot install. I tried to write the commands in the terminal when booting from usb but the commands were not found.</p>

<p>At this point Im just been guessing on what to do but I have tried to disable secure boot in bios and reinstalling bios (same version as before which was the latest) with easy flash. It did nothing.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what to do would be greatly appreciated!<br>

<p>Thank you @cmak.fr and @Mathieu for your answers. It makes better sense now. I also found this link after reading you reply <a href=""https://www.webmasterworld.com/php/3127164.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.webmasterworld.com/php/3127164.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Snooping  bit further I found that the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag also works when combined with <code>\n</code>. Why is that?</p>

  <p>before you go ahead, I've to inform you that I've asked this question at Aug 1st 2019 on unix.stackexchange but didn't get any appropriate response. so I've brought the whole question here, but <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/533399/ubuntu-16-04-vps-security-check-whether-installation-of-the-os-is-unaltered-c"">here</a> is the original place where I asked the question for your information and I encourage you to take a quick look at it. I also didn't find any related question so far. thanks in advance for your attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd ordered a VPS with Ubuntu 16.04/64-bit LTS server edition with some ports opened, which are essential to my application.</p>

<p>recently the VPS was delivered to me, so I accessed the VPS using ssh and changed the ssh password.</p>

<p>now my question is: </p>

<p>how can I make sure that <strong>the Ubuntu 16.04 installation that was delivered to me</strong>, is a clean installation and does not have any extra functionality (malicious or not) and/or extra files with respect to the original OS that Ubuntu provides publicly?</p>

<p><strong>now I have to say that I trust my VPS provider, but I have this question in general.</strong></p>

<p>unfortunately I wasn't able to find any similar question. so I would be happy, if you refer me to one.</p>

<p>following are more details that might be helpful.</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

"1086257","Ubuntu 16.04 time stops syncing timedatectl fails to query server, but timesyncd is active","<p><strong>Original Question:</strong></p>

<p>See updates below.</p>

<p>I'm hoping I can get some assistance working through an issue I've been having on my Ubuntu server. I'm running the desktop version of 16.04 as a server and occasionally I have noticed that the system time gets out of sync/stops updating. Typically this precedes total loss of remote access and requires a restart to fix. Here is the output of systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service:</p>

<pre><code>    systemd-timesyncd.service - Network Time Synchronization

</code></pre>

<p>And here is the output of timedatectl:</p>

<pre><code>~$ timedatectl
Failed to query server: Connection timed out
</code></pre>

<p>The system time at this point was off by about 12 hours (reporting time of yesterday ~ 7pm when it is actually ~ 11am the following day). Time zone is correct.</p>

<p>I have also noticed that my cron jobs stop running when this happens, as I have a cron job that checks internet connection on regular intervals and reports its output to a log file. This log file stops updating around the same time that the time gets out of sync. I also have a cron job that backs up certain directories, and these backups are not up-to-date.</p>

<p>Please let me know if any additional information would be helpful. I'm still a relative novice to Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>@Damocles Thanks for your suggestion. Yes, the computer has a working network connection. I did not have any firewall rules set to allow NTP (port 123) through UFW or my firewall on my Ubiquiti router. However, it would still work for a while (sometimes weeks at a time) before bugging out. Could this still be a firewall issue?</p>

<p>I went ahead and added the ufw rule and added a firewall exception and NAT translation in my router and rebooted the server. It syncs for now, but my firewall did not seem to be in the way because the traffic count for that rule did not increase.</p>

<p>Is there anything else that could be blocking this connection? Perhaps something that would allow it to work at first, but cause a dropped/blocked NTP access down the line?</p>

<p>I also found this command to check time sync status, but it returns and unknown operation error:</p>

<pre><code>:~$ timedatectl timesync-status
Unknown operation timesync-status
</code></pre>

<p><strong>New Update 11/1/18</strong></p>

<p>I installed chrony as suggested, but still getting the same issue, within 24 hours. Something is definitely wrong. And ~16 hours after a fresh boot and chrony installed, here is the output of some chrony commands:</p>

<p>VX Connectbot (1.7.1-29 on android 6.0.1 G900PVPS3CQD1) can connect to the bionic sshd just fine, even if it's running on the focal kernel, but gets no response from the focal sshd.  What's up with that?</p>

<p>/etc/ssh/sshd_config is identical on bionic and focal.  ufw isn't installed on either of them.  Either can be reached from other ubuntu installs.  it's just VX Connectbot that's getting the snub.</p>

<p>i tried to use the bionic sshd as a workaround.  if substituted directly into focal it won't start.  it'll run and receive connections in a bionic chroot, but from there i can't reach the focal x11vnc thru the usual tunnel.</p>

<p>Anything else i should try?</p>

<p>Will i have to find a new ssh client for android?  is there a shortcut to trying a slew of them, is there a good place to see good recommendations?</p>

"1235305","PC does not boot when booting","<p>Four months ago I bought a Dell computer with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS installed. A month later, i had to turn off the PC button because it didn't continue to install for a long time when i wanted to update it to 19.04 ubuntu. The computer made errors when it was reopened, but it was updated at 7:04 p.m. Then I updated at 7:10 p.m. I now have ubuntu 20.04 LTS installed on my computer on April 25.</p>

<p>My problem is when I turn on the PC, it doesn't boot directly. It falls into the grub directory by saying the wrong command. I'm getting a reboot again. When I do this 2-3 times, the initramfs package could not be opened and the ubuntu is installed by giving mouse error at 2. Even when I press escape, there's nothing wrong with the study, but how do I solve this boot thing, even though I received the bug that couldn't be booted from the grub in the leaking article. Of course, since it does not boot normally, I applied commands from the terminal, accompanied by articles I read online about how to solve the problem. Failed.</p>

<p>I printed the iso file of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on DVD. I tested it before you set it up, no problem. Ok, let me install the new one but there are movies and pdf comics i want to watch in the ext4 linux installed section 200 gbit as soon as possible. I said to narrow the ext4 Linux section with dVDs and gparted it, and transfer it to the new section, but when the gparted worked and locked it towards the end, there was no room.</p>

<p>In short, my computer opens when rebooted 3-4 times, but once I open it, I want it turned on. Because I installed Snap, it opened a worldwide mount directory for programs in the package. Only Ubuntu is installed on my computer. Harddisk 3 e divided.The first part efi, the second part is reserved for Microsoft 5 Gb, the third part ext4 Linux up to 870 Gb.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to ask is that when I want to install the computer again from usb or dvd Ubuntu, I should disable the Security Boot option on Bios. As far as I know, for these windows installations,</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

As far as i know, samba is used to share files to windows computers or other systems. This is not what i am trying to achieve. The only thing i want to use samba for, is to hide those folders to a list of blacklisted users, and make them visible to another set of them. It is hard for me to test things out since i only have one vps which i cannot reset, subsequently i have not done much testing myself. Most tutorials i have found online assume that you would want to use the sharing to other systems, which as already stated, I do not want to do. Any help of sorts would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Example: I have 3 users and a personal folder for each user.(They all have their own user account)  I want to prevent other users from seeing personal folders from the other users.</p>

But I don't know anything about CSS and now I can't boot Ubuntu anymore.</p>
<p>I made my laptop dual boot between Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04. So I'm expecting to fix that file from Windows. How can I get the root privilege and then access the ubuntu partition on Windows?</p>
<p>These were my attempts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ext2Fsd: It could see the content of all of my partitions, except the root and home. When I mounted them, the root and home partitions just appeared to be empty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ext2Explorer: It displayed no partition (even with run as admin)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Linux Reader: I mounted the root partition, and could actually go to the directory of the CSS file! But when I try to fix it (by first copy it to Windows, type it back to its original content, and then paste it back to its directory), it says: No such file or directory. I also tried to disable the read-only mount permission but there's always an error from nowhere that stopped the process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DiskGenius: Same as Linux Reader: I could get to the CSS file location, copy &amp; paste, but &quot;No such file or directory&quot; again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Windows Subsystem for Linux: I went to <code>/dev</code>, <code>ls -l</code> and looked for sdb1 2 3 4, one of them was my root partition. But there're only a pile of tty files, no sdb. Also went to <code>/mnt</code>, which shown me 3 files C D E that were my Windows partitions. I used Ext2Fsd to mount my root as F, and went to <code>/mnt/F</code>. It's empty.</p>

<p>this will be my second question on ubuntu, a follow up on my first problem... as i use UBUNTU I am encountering a low disk space reminder, so I decided to extend the partition that is causing low disk space. Booted up a USB that i used to install my UBUNTU, then run gparted. (the above pic is gparted taken on installed UBUNTU not on USB) I resized first the ext4 /home into 100gig after clicking ok, It shows an error that i wont be able to boot. I ignored the error and clicked the arrorw button but error is still there but I proceed. Then next I resize the swap. Adjust it to the right most to give the 60gig for ext4 /. When i click the arrow button it gives an error  and it just revert back to their original sizes. Afraid of losing my files I immediately restart and remove the USB. what could be the problem or is there a mistake on my process? How will I expand ext4 / and resize ext4 /home.</p>

i can't do both at the same time, it's boring.</p>

<p>sometimes it is worse than the video...sometimes the flickering/tearing happens to the desktop too when the desktop appears for the first time after login.</p>

<p>problem is that my laptop's cpu is not maintaining turbo boost of 3.9ghz for more than a few seconds before dropping to base on ubuntu 20.04</p>
<p>as soon as i hit render it touches max frequency but after a couple of seconds it drops to base frequency</p>
<p>any solutions?</p>
<p>Edit :- temperature is not the issue , cpu jumps to 88-89°c for brief moment (when it's turboing) then hits base frequency and stay stable at 57-58°c</p>

<p>Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<p>We have tried different distros including fedora and pop_os and they have the same issue
System76 use this motherboard and processor so I though it would be ok.</p>
<p>We have updated the bios and tweaked settings with no luck.
Ran a full memtest and it showed no errors.</p>
<p>we returned it to the shop we got it from and they have been running tests on it.</p>
<p>They put the latest windows version and it did seem to be more stable but It crashed when running vmware with Ubuntu on it. I didn't run it long enough after wards to see if it crashed on its own.</p>
<p>We then switched back to Linux and started switching components. We switched the memory and then video card and we were still getting crashes. Then they switched out the processor for the 3960x. I ran builds all night long and it had no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>The guys at the shop have said they will send the processor back to the vendor and they will replace but I'm still not convinced this is the issue.</p>
<p>Freezing happens at random it can happily do a few builds with make -j1000 and then crash when I open vim. I can't see anything obvious from the logs it looks to me like the whole system just halts.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have an idea of what my issue could be?</p>

Until now. Today i tried to enter the password, but failed to do this. The password field remains completely blank, and if i hit the login button with mouse, it says the password was incorrect.</p>
<p>Moreover, it seems that the keyboard input goes straight to other applications, e. g. i can switch between windows with alt+tab (and window list is shown (but no lock screen in this list)) and start/stop youtube videos (sound from which is played) with space key. So ironically it lost focus.</p>
<p>When i push &quot;change user&quot; button, user selection screen appears, and i can enter the correct password there, but i end up with the same focal fossa screen.</p>
<p>However i can log in to command line with ctrl+alt+f* or ssh.</p>
<p>I tried <code>gnome-screensaver-command -d</code> and <code>loginctl unlock-session</code>(s) with no effect. Also i tried to find and kill lock screen process and suspend/wake once again, but the effect was the same.</p>
<p>I use gnome-flashback, metacity and xscreensaver.</p>
<p>Also i have to mention that i played factorio yesterday. It was the second time i did that, but the first time i set &quot;minimize on focus loss&quot; option. And with this option it was quite difficult to maximize the factorio back, which i think  is similar to the discussed symptoms (except i can not gain focus on the lock screen cos it is not shown in alt+tab window list). However i exited factorio before suspension.</p>

The filesystem is mounted with acl enabled, i checked this with tune2fs.</p>
<p>Here is a part of the script i use to set permissions:</p>
<pre><code>#remove all chmod perms
chmod -R u=,g=,o=   home
# remove default acl settings
setfacl -R -b -k    home
# set default acl 
setfacl -dR -m u:me:rwx,g:we:rwx home
# set actual permissions
setfacl -R -m u:me:rwx,g:we:rwx home

d---rws---+ 13 she   we  4096 sep  4 15:26 she

# Very strange , the chmod group bits are set!
# setfacl should not touch these bits?

# run as user: me
ls home
# result of: ls home:

# Although the acl bits are ok, permission denied!
# It looks like the system api does not use acl bits

<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1 Are the standard chmod bits different from the acl bits?</p>

Using my server to log network DC's that seem to occur sporadicly during the days.

This works, <strong>but i do not get the last lines of ping statistics when the program ends.</strong> Problem started when i found and added <code>| while read pong; do echo &quot;$(date): $pong&quot;; done</code> to the program to add timestamp on the pings.</p>

<p>List of things that i have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>I heard that Windows sets read-only flag to NTFS partitions before shutting down, so i booted into Windows, disabled Fast Boot and Hibernation and rebooted instead of shutting down. Didn't work.</li>
<li>Modified permissions using <code>sudo chmod -r ugo-rw /data</code>, didn't work</li>
<li>Unmounted /dev/sda5 and remounted it with read and write permissions<br>
<code>sudo umount /dev/sda5</code><br>

<p>The problem is many times this mechanism doesn't work, and it causes my system to crash (its a python script that uses all the memory), I am doing machine learning stuff and i cannot predict how much some of my scripts might use, and i was expecting Ubuntu to just basically kill an app when it suddenly uses all the system memory, but it doesn't work, and my system crashes (everything hangs, no mouse movement or anything, but using REISUB i can reboot the system)</p>
<p>sometimes its not even sudden surge in RAM usage, the script just keeps allocating more RAM and RAM and when it reaches the limit my system basically freezes and Ubuntu doesn't stop it!! i thought there was a defensive mechanism for this situation?</p>
<p>so my question is :</p>
<p>How can i tell Ubuntu to kill any app that suddenly uses all the free RAM available? basically what is the best solution for me to stop the crashes other that changing my scripts?</p>

<p>I noticed something strange from the beginning  and I don't know why the newest version is in grey colour and also has a Hush sign to indicate that it's windows environment while the old one has the tilde sign, as usual, to indicate a Linux environment.
the picture clarifies what I am telling if anyone can explain to me why the newest version is grey, is it because it's not installed correctly or because of the existence of the old version,
it would be appreciable, thanks in advance</p>

This was working fine since I installed Ubuntu, but now grsync takes over 30s to start. I tried via the terminal and from the start menu with the same long loading time. I installed appmenu-gtk2-module as suggested here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2441572"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2441572</a></p>
<p>but there's no improvement. Also Chromium is starting quite slowly when starting it the first time after a boot. When starting it a second time it comes up fast. However Grsync starts always slow and this problem started maybe some weeks ago (was not using grsync for some time). I figured out that it basically affects all QT apps.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 17 11 2020: SOLVED!!</strong>  I had noticed that most images were treated as text files; from the error log, I noticed that every file was handled as a PhP file. Suddenly I understood the Apache2 conf file had something wrong and I found this row in the 000-default.conf file:</p>
<pre><code>  SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</code></pre>
<p>out of any context; so Apache2 handled every file as Php!!</p>
<p>Sorry, it was an oversight of mine!</p>
<p>I commented that line, restarted Apache and now it works fine!</p>
<p>Only a question left: why in spite of this error, Apache2 loaded a few jpeg images correctly??</p>

It works i think but something feels very wrong here, my guts tell me because it treats <em>/root/</em> as home.</p>

I usually download movies from torrents and ISO files that I test between this time. My question is how do I stop my WiFi at 6am so it turns off everything ? Because there are files that takes up to 20 GB and it doesn’t finish in one night and I have to stop it at 6. What should I do in that case ? Should I write a python program or should I change something in the settings ?</p>
<p>I really need help for that, if someone knows a program that I can download that makes all the work for me please tell me. Btw I can’t enter in my tplink router from the web page, so I should try and find an application thank you.</p>

Those issues <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/1296056/1152544"">have been resolved</a>, but I am not:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Python user</li>
<li><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23052108"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">comfortable with <code>snap</code> yet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And it seems the <code>apt</code> repository is not maintaining a current, operational version of <code>youtube-dl</code>, so my <em>preferred</em> approach won't work.</p>
<p>It seems that installing <code>youtube-dl</code> from source would be a good solution. I've not done this on Ubuntu, and have very limited experience on any plaform. I've found <a href=""https://www.ubuntupit.com/install-software-from-source-code-in-your-linux-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what appears to be a decent guide</a>, but nothing specific for <code>youtube-dl</code> on Ubuntu. Is there anything else I should know before proceeding?</p>
<hr />
<h3>Other Notes (Edit):</h3>
<p>Just to confirm that <code>sudo apt-get install youtube-dl</code> has issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preparing to unpack .../12-youtube-dl_2020.03.24-1_all.deb ...<br />
Unpacking youtube-dl (2020.03.24-1) ...<br />
Setting up youtube-dl (2020.03.24-1) ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the <code>apt</code> installation of <code>youtube-dl</code> completes <em>successfully</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ which youtube-dl
/usr/bin/youtube-dl 
$ youtube-dl --version
bash: /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl: No such file or directory
$ /usr/bin/youtube-dl --version
2020.03.24
</code></pre>
<p>Which <em>suggests</em> to a newbie such as I that something is amiss. Note that there is confusion wrt where <code>youtube-dl</code> is installed: <code>/usr/bin</code> vs <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. And it clearly installs an old (March, 2020) version.</p>
<p>Using the install procedure from the <a href=""https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/tree/2020.11.26"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>youtube-dl</code> github page</a> yields this:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl  
$ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl  
$ youtube-dl --version
/usr/bin/env: ‘python’: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>For reasons unclear to me, the <code>youtube-dl</code> maintainers want the installation in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. No idea why <code>python</code> is expected in <code>/usr/bin/env</code>.</p>
<p>All the above is to address various comments made since this Q was submitted.</p>
<p>And yes, if I uninstall/remove/reverse the <code>apt</code> install, and delete the <code>curl</code>'d d/l to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, I can successfully install and run <code>youtube-dl</code> using <code>sudo pip3</code>. But some caution that <code>sudo pip3</code> should NOT be done - rather it should be <em>virtualenv</em> (or something like that) instead. That is why I have posted this question: <strong>I don't want to use something I don't don't use &amp; don't understand because I can't maintain it.</strong> I don't think that's unreasonable or makes me recalcitrant. I just want to know how to install <code>youtube-dl</code> from source - if that is a reasonable thing to do given all of the above.</p>

<p>So I use Kubuntu 20.04 with additional PPA: wineHQ, steam, spotify, kisak-mesa
I had used the PPA Oibaf before, but since the i386 build was missing i changed to kisak-mesa, deactivating Oibaf. I also tried Oibaf again, since the I386 are working again, did not change anything so I installed the newest version of kisak-mesa again (which updated today, but did not change anything.)
In recovery mode it will try to install broken or missing packages, which are not shown after I boot into Kubuntu.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I started a huge backup (~200k files, 800GB) with right-click copy/paste. The ETA was around 16 hours... kinda slow because my external drive is kinda slow... But so far, nothing unusual here.</p>
<p>Today, I log back to my machine and I have that  popup telling me there was a transfer error on a file (unable to copy) asking me if I want to skip/retry/cancel/etc... You know, the kind of annoying feature we had in previous versions of Windows more than a decade ago that halted a whole process just because of an insignificant file?</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, I am not asking the machine to make a decision for me and choose what to do in case a file doesn't copy... But why did it stop copying the other files that were fine? Do I have to stay 16 hours in front of my computer just in case there is a problem with a file. Will my backup take 1 week just because it stops on a few small files? Since so many years, Windows continues copying the files that are fine and at the ends asks for all the problematic files in one bunch... Did I just travel back in time 20 years?</p>

<pre><code>wget -nc -O ${HERE}/FirefoxSetup.tar.bz2 &quot;https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&amp;os=linux64&amp;lang=en-US&quot;

<p>and</p>
<pre><code>wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

<p>are working very well, downloading the latest versions of these browsers without the need to specify the exact name and build number, unlike in the case of Vivaldi. I want to have a script that downloads this browser(Vivaldi) anytime without my intervention to update/change it.</p>

"1303554","How do I interpret output from ""top"" command? How do I see actual CPU load?","<p>I thought <code>top</code> showed how heavy the load was on the CPU (&amp; mem). Baffled by results showing &gt;275% CPU usage (see output from <code>top</code> at the bottom), I read a bit in the documentation, and it looks like it only shows the ratio of each process, not the percentage of the total &quot;CPU capacity&quot; is in use (which of course can only be between 0% and 100%)?</p>
<p>What does it then mean when the accummulated <code>%CPU</code> is above 100%?</p>
<p>And how do I see the actual (percentage) load of the CPU(s)? With a bit of searching, I found a bunch of tools, but none of the ones I found seem to show the actual CPU load, as far as I could see.</p>

"1303616","Settings not opening in Ubuntu 20.04","<p>I'm a new user of Ubuntu 20.04,
whenever i try to open settings,it opens, but don't show up at all, unless I use a second screen.</p>
<p>if not then it will like this:</p>
<p>Now settings is open
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/yxYVg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/yxYVg.jpg"" alt=""now settings is open )"" /></a></p>
<p>I tried using terminal to reinstall Gnome-Control-Center using these command:</p>
<p><code> sudo apt-get update</code></p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-control-center </code></p>
<p>then</p>
<p><code>  gnome-control-center display</code></p>
<p><code>gnome-control-center  </code></p>
<p>and it maybe worked for some users, but not for me.</p>
<p>anyone knows what the reason may be or a different solution?</p>
<p>btw my Gnome-Control-Center has some issues that i couldnt fix even with reisntalling, so i started using flathub in my software to avoid the issue, but couldnt fix settings</p>
