<p>What I noticed is when I reached my supposed daily limit a red warning box came up clearly indicating I reached a limit (of 20 or so I believe?) and I could no longer delete comments that had <em>at least 1 up vote to them</em>… But I could <em>still</em> delete comments that had <em>no up vote on them</em>. Seemed like a bug, but regardless I went ahead and deleted more and more of my comments.</p>

<p>To be fully transparent, while it seems I clearly deleted more comments than are normally possible I at no point thought this was an issue as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19757/243319"">explained in this FAQ here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are disposable: unlike posts, there's no revision history,

  moderators, and in response to flags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are temporary ""Post-It"" notes left on a question or answer.
  You should not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification
  has been made, an edit added to the post to include new information,
  or the issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to
  deletion. In reality, many obsolete or chatty comments remain
  untouched due to the high volume of comments posted, but this does not
  mean that they can't or shouldn't be deleted in the future.</p>

"273140","Allow linked external accounts to grant commenting privileges","<p>I've seen relevant 'answers' from people qualified to answer questions on open source projects deleted simply because those qualified people didn't have enough magic internet points to ask clarifying questions in comments. Yes, comments are not what answers are for. Yes, reviewers generally don't have the ability to move answers to comments. Yes, this horse has been beaten again and again. No, the status quo is <em>not okay</em>.</p>

<p>Specifically, the problem is a dependence on the ebb and flow of social cues for a user to establish reputation when they ought to be allowed to provide relevant feedback as soon as possible. This is not a problem on meta, as the reputation requirement is only 5. Everywhere else, it's at 50.</p>

<p>This is the thought (described in a Stack Overflow-centric way for ease of digestion):</p>

<p>Connect question tags with projects located on blessed open source hosts (e.g. GitHub and BitBucket) and check new SO users' linked accounts for collaborator and contributor status on those projects. If the user checks out, they get commenting privileges on questions with those tags regardless of low initial reputation. The process of linking these to enable commenting would require a bit of user initiative and display suitable warnings/instructions as they go through it. The likelihood of such users being 'noisy' is significantly diminished, and further having collaborator status in a project and genuine interest in making the project successful thus is not likely something that would significantly contribute to noisiness.</p>

<p>This leaves open the following issues up for discussion, among others:</p>

<ul>
<li>The metric used to see if a user 'checks out'

<ul>
<li>Through what process would trust be established between accounts? This would necessarily be context-specific.</li>
<li>For example: how would one determine one's expertise in a particular area of biology from e.g. an OpenScienceFramework account? This kind of thing might be easier for Stack Exchanges like Stack Overflow where questions and projects tend to follow the same delineation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New projects not having relevant tags</li>
<li>The blessed sites from which accounts may be linked for which StackExchange sites</li>
</ul>

<p>There are likely well known inherent flaws in the Stack Exchange system (technical, social, etc.) that hurt efforts such as this, but, c'est la vie. Just a thought.</p>

"273391","Promoting politeness in comments","<p>Or rather discouraging rude comments.</p>

<p>I've noticed that people tend to be quite polite in their answers.  Perhaps because reputation is at stake.</p>

<p>It happens rather frequently that people tend to be rude or disrespectful in their comments.  The rudeness is rarely enough to be worth a flag, but enough that it brings down the level of conversation.  Rude comments tend to encourage other people to make rude comments or cause the target of the rude comment to respond.  Rude comments rarely provide any value to anyone.</p>

<p>Perhaps people leave rude comments because there is no consequence?</p>

<p>I think it would promote politeness and civility if there was a way for people to vote to indicate that a comment is unnecessarily rude and have a consequence to the commenter, such as decreased reputation.</p>

<p>Here is one proposal:</p>

<ul>
<li>An icon can be added after each comment to allow a person to indicate that the comment is rude.</li>
<li>For each person who does that, another icon will appear to show that a person designated the comment as rude (up to a maximum).</li>
<li>After three people vote the comment as rude, the content will be removed (though it could appear with the show more comments link) and the commenter will lose one reputation point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is not to punish the rude commenter, but to give them some feedback and hopefully nudge them towards being more respectful to others.</p>

I was eligible for health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, 401k plan after 500 hours of working, short term disability insurance, long term disability insurance, workers compensation, life insurance etc. I don't get paid for any holidays, personal vacation days or sick days.

"273815","Proposed way to deal with wrong answers","<p>While many answers on SE sites are of great value, sometimes some answers are also wrong. This is dangerous since this misleads readers and hurts the network’s credibility.</p>

<p>It seems there are two major ways to deal with wrong answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>The right one: Leave a comment explaining why it is wrong, hopefully it’s author fixes it. If not, let the community downvote it.</li>
</ol>

<p>This path is great, but only provided it works. It doesn’t have to. <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/255198/how-to-handle-historical-highly-upvoted-but-completely-incorrect-answers"">It</a> | <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267772/answers-which-are-wrong"">also</a> | <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/276561/how-to-handle-accepted-but-wrong-answers"">happens</a> | <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7572/why-do-incorrect-answers-keep-getting-accepted"">that</a> | <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/78438/blatantly-wrong-accepted-answer"">wrong</a> answers  are  highly upvoted or accepted for a long time. While I have no evidence, to my intuition the “post a comment and downvote” solution is bound to be relatively ineffective on high-traffic sites like StackOverflow, just because few members of the community look at old thread or try to clean them up, partially because there are so unhandleably many of them, and partially because of the constant stream of new questions requiring attention. So, one person may post a comment and downvote, but no one notices it and the wrong answer remains at the top.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The wrong one: Delete the wrong answer by a moderator, or flag it. This is <a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2908/shoutout-to-moderators-stop-deleting-flawed-downvoted-and-wrong-on-topic-answe?rq=1"">frowned</a> | <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5222/308462"">upon</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>I’m suggesting a third way:</h2>

<p><strong>Allow answers to be marked as wrong by users with enough reputation</strong>. A user, marking an answer as incorrect, will have to elaborate themselves why do they think so. Answers marked as wrong will be put in a separate review queue, therefore bringing their wrongness to the attention of the community (mitigating the problem of no one noticing that a comment was posted explaining the falseness of an answer). If the answer gathers enough anti-support of users allowed to vote in such a queue, it automatically gets deleted. The mechanism here could be similar to that of casting delete votes. However, the ‘wrong answer’ button would be distinct from the ‘delete’ button, following the different purposes of both mechanisms (I’m <em>not</em> suggesting to cast delete votes on wrong answers).</p>

<p>It is important to note that my proposed mechanism should only be used against answers that are blatantly false. It should not be used against technically correct answers that yet promote “bad practises” or are “inelegant” or something; these are opinion-based, subjective issues, and therefore they can be left to the usual judgement by the community by upvotes or downvotes. What I’m trying to fight here, and what I think should be fought much more vigorously here, are answers that are objectively, factually, provably false. Therefore, I’m not suggesting the mechanism to all sites in the network. Opinion-based sites, like Writers or Worldbuilding or Parenting or Programmers or CodeGolf could have this queue disabled; but sites like StackOverflow or Mathematics or Skeptics should definitely have it enabled.</p>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>If the mechanics proposed above are too harsh or too similar to the delete votes or low quality review queue, my other proposal is that any answers marked as false by reviewers of this suggested new queue would be moved to the bottom, greyed out regardless of their votes and have a visible warning put near them like “According to the community, this answer contains false information”.</p>

"274050","Is having the sidebar on the right side better?","<p>As I know, all SE sites inherit current global layout, namely the right-hand sidebar and the left-hand Q/A column.</p>
<p>From my point of view, however, the <em>left-hand</em> sidebar is significantly better in that sense, that it improves my concentration on the main text flow.
It happens because the text lines start more close to the center of the monitor, and I scan through the information slightly easier than in the case they start from the left part of the window.</p>
<p>So could it look for example:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/HzLG0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/HzLG0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>It is probably next to impossible that the design would change so globally, still the discussion and critics on this idea is welcome.<br />
Apart from the fact that it is so &quot;by design&quot;, what can be telling against implementing the sidebar on the left?<br />
I can think only of the disadvantage, that the ads can be too colorful and  make an even more negative effect. But the latter could be tweaked just by adding more space between the sidebar and Q/A section.</p>
<p>Optimal solution would be in my opinion to make Linked and Related side section on the left, because they are useful and not so colorful.<br />
Notifications and hot questions would be better to have on the right side, since they are too contrasting with the background (like the yellow featured note on the screenshot).</p>

"276586","Monetizing SE bounties?","<p>I often use math.stackexchange.com and MathOverflow.net to ask questions.  However, the questions I ask typically tend to be too advanced for Math.SE but too trivial for MO.  Since typical MO questions take around 20-40 minutes to answer [for me anyways], I often get very high-quality answers on MO, and for this reason I do not wish to bother MO users unless I absolutely need something answered.</p>
<p>If there were a way to pay users who give good answers, I would feel less uncomfortable asking MO users my questions.  I saw <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25615/offering-actual-money-as-a-bounty"">here</a> that the idea of connecting money to SE has been viewed very negatively.  However, none of downsides listed are something that cannot be worked around.  Here is how:</p>
<p>Option 1: no modifications, except:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0. when accepting an answer, give an option to &quot;Send $__ to this user.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would already be enough for me.</p>
<p>Option 2 would consist of the following modifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Require pre-paying bounties.</li>
<li>An answerer does not get the bounty unless manually awarded by the asker within a week [otherwise, bounty money goes to SE].</li>
</ol>
<p>2a. When new users post questions, add a warning that these questions are answered by volunteers, not paid researchers, and that their money can be lost without an answer if their question is not formatted properly.  Sort of &quot;You're paying for the time on Featured tab, not for the answer&quot; philosophy.  If they don't like it, they can go to Google Answers.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Depening on your reputation, place a limit on the amount of monetary bounties you are allowed to place.</li>
<li>Make the minimum bounty, say, $20.  Possibly make a single forum for less-than-$20 questions, where unskilled people might go to try to earn a buck or two.  This cut-off can be adjusted for various sites (e.g. $50 for MathOverflow, vs. $5 for Math.SE)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my answer to the downsides of monetizing SE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guaranteed, someone, somewhere has time to burn and needs cash. No guarantee they know the answer, mind you... but they'll take a guess at it. And since they really need that $20, they'll likely hang around and down-vote any other answers, while picking fights with anyone who criticizes theirs. Just look at the little fights people get into over rep now, and spice it up with some desperation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(2) Requiring bounty award to be manually awarded would solve this problem.</p>
<p>Also, quoting kalenjordan's answer (which will henceforth always be denoted by fixed-point font):</p>
<pre><code>  The link juice and traffic that SE provides currently is already a
  massive incentive for abuse, and yet they're able to handle it very well.

  The same could be said about point bounties - because they are an
  enhanced incentive they increase the potential for fraud.
</code></pre>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>People should be motivated to answer questions because they are interested in the field, not because they are offered some money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on the field.  For example, if I remember correctly: back when I was a beginning programmer, I was writing an Android app that compiles PDF files for my math research.  I did not know how to make the native PDF Viewer app to open from within my app, so I asked this on SE, but got downvotes because the question was so basic, with links to internet sites explaining it [about half of which I tried to implement before posting the question].  Sure, it's basic, and it would take about 15 minutes to answer it; but, I spent around 18 hours already, and still haven't figured out how to do it; so every time I wish to view the PDF file I compiled I have to leave my app, go to the PDF viewer, and the close the PDF viewer, go back to my app, and reload the file I was working on.  At the time, I did not have the rep to offer a bounty on that question.  I would definitely be willing to pay even $100 for the 15-minute answer to a &quot;basic&quot; question.</p>
<pre><code> People respond to incentives. If people are supposed to answer purely
 and only because of their interest, then why have points and badges
 in the first place?
</code></pre>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, and after you answer, if the person refuses to pay up, Jeff and Joel should have to mediate the dispute. Or, maybe we can just migrate the question to LawyerOverflow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) Requiring pre-paying bounties would solve that problem.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>If [an answerer] tells the [asker] the question has no definitive answer, [in cases where he's unpaid,] that response is more likely taken as fact rather than a personal failing on the [answerer]'s part</p>
<p>In the Google Answers arena, I have seen researchers insulted, sworn at, and otherwise degraded by people not happy with the responses they received</p>
<p>While I enjoyed my time at Google Answers, I was soured by people asking $4 questions and not being satisfied with the depth of the responses they received, responses that had clearly taken a fair amount of the researcher's time.</p>
<p>This &quot;customer is always right&quot; philosophy that pervades marketplace interactions seemed to override personal senses of reasonableness in many cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These particular issues are motivated by users not understanding how SE works.  They just come in, and expect to pay and get what they want, not taking the extra time to get familiar with SE.  My (2a) and (3) attempt to address this issue; however, it is possible that yet another approach might be necessary to solve this particular issue.</p>
<p>In my suggested solution, the fact that the money has been paid even if the question gets no answers, should make the asker less inclined to be unhappy over getting a low-quality answer, because the other option would be getting no answer at all.</p>
<pre><code>  Sure there's the possibility that the developer spends the 30 minutes
  and then the asker says they didn't feel the quality of the answer was
  high enough, and so the developer is frustrated by that. But that's an
  existing problem on the site just with the point system.

  People answer questions all the time and don't even get them marked as
  the answer or upvoted at all. There can be mechanisms to help with
  this such as the askers rate of marking a question as answered, etc.

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>If the questioner offers too little, the researcher should simply refuse to answer their question. Of course, in the competition for scarce questions, this never happened, except in extreme instances.</p>
<p>my experience working for Google Answers made me feel more often like I was being paid to do Google searches that the questioners didn't have the time or the skill to do, rather than using my research background and abilities to turn facts into actual knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(4) Setting the minimum bounty at $20 should get rid of this problem.</p>
<pre><code>  If money was offered, it would feel like work so I wouldn't want
  to do it in my free time any more.
</code></pre>
<p>I believe that people answer $0 questions on SE already.  In my opinion, the main difference is, when askers are not paying anything, then they feel expected to put in some effort on their part.  The big downside of allowing low-value questions is that doing so would result in low-quality questions, for which people expect answers.  Moving such questions to a separate forum should free the main forums of such questions, and at the same time allow people looking to earn a buck or two, to do so without affecting their rep on the main site.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code> &gt; Why not just post the question on another freelance project site?

 You could say the same thing about SE's resume and job posting
 services. Why not just use existing services that are out there?

 The answer is that SE has an amazing community behind it. The chances
 that my question will be answered quickly and accurately are simply
 much higher on SE than basically anywhere else.
</code></pre>
<p>This definitely seems like a viable option: at least for trial on select SE sites.  Can anyone think of any major shortcomings I missed? [have to go do something now; more reasons to be added when I come back]</p>

<p>Judging by the trend, I am likely to lose up to 100 reputation eventually.  I do not mind losing most reputation points; however, I am afraid this would remove my ability to participate in the Meta site (which requires 5 reputation points)-- and thus I'd be permanently barred from the Meta site.  I suggest not being able to lose more than 1 privilege level per question.  In other words, even if your reputation points go below the threshold for the next privilege level, you would still retain the privileges you once had [less one privilege level].</p>

  In that case the OP asked about <strong>why</strong> there are so many splits.
  <em>This isn't my question.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My concern is not so much about providing more sub-sites, but the way overlapping questions are handled right now. It appears every site moderator just keeps looking to find something wrong with the next question or answer she can find and will vote to close the entire thing or at least down vote it.</p>

<p>I understand if its really off-topic, sure close it, shut it down, make it go away, but if it's just not fitting perfectly into someones own expectation of what this exact site should be about, but other people appear to happily exchange knowledge there anyway - telling them off and closing their topics appears counterproductive and doesn't help anyone.</p>

<p>For example there is a site about <strong>Earth Science</strong> and one about <strong>Outdoors</strong>, one about <strong>Travel</strong> and another about <strong>Aviation</strong>, one for <strong>Health</strong>, one for <strong>Fitness</strong>, one for <strong>Sports</strong>, one for <strong>DIY home improvement</strong> and one for <strong>Crafts</strong> and one for <strong>Lifehacks</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, these categories can be differentiated, but not all questions will fit exactly into one of them or can easily be asked on multiple boards at the same time (my point here).</p>

<p>Just like we don't have one site for <strong>Python</strong>, one for <strong>C++</strong>, one for <strong>Java</strong>, how can we justify having one site for <strong>Academia</strong>, but another one for <strong>Biology</strong> and another one for <strong>Physics</strong> and a third for <strong>Chemistry</strong> and another one for <strong>Mathematics</strong>?</p>

<p>What is the guy with a question about chemical equations regarding his biology experiment going to do? First, he'll try in Biology, because, you know, that's his comfort zone, but he'll be directed to go somewhere else. Then he'll try in chemistry, where he'll be told it's too mathematical a question. Then he'll try in Mathematics, where someone things this is all about general science.</p>

<p>See, topics can not just be categorised into small little sections and split that way - it's insane - there are interdisciplinary questions everywhere and the current direction Stack Exchange is taking is killing them off.</p>

<p>Yes, you can vote down and close this one, too, since it's becoming more of a complaint than a question, but I sincerely hope someone will please turn this around and see that Stack Exchange was all about bringing people together and not splitting and disecting them into smaller and smaller categories.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong - I love Stack Exchange - I just don't love when people disregard valid and well written answers or questions, because they don't fit into their exact topic expectation.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you disagree (I am sure many people will) and why?
And if you need a proper question:</p>

<p><strong>Is splitting Stack Exchange into tiny sub-sites really the direction we should be taking?</strong></p>

<p>My suggestion is simple - just have bigger categories - merge those sub-sites, maybe even better:</p>

<p><strong>Why not allow the users to vote to merge one Stack Exchange site into another?</strong>
I think this would be fair and the right approach, because it'll be a community decision, by the people who actually want to use these sites.</p>

A lot of it one discovers only on a need to know basis when running into a similar situation. I was thinking about a new feature to leverage this.</p>

<p>I think that Stack Exchange holds great value in turning its old questions (which already have answers) into a more direct learning experience. Let us say I'm a user that wants to learn more about a specific topic. SE has some knowledge of my skill level on that topic. If not it can try to estimate it by presenting me with questions which already have answers. If I feel comfortable with answering the questions I receive, and the answers are familiar terrain, I can give feedback on how confident I am in resolving the question and also how entertaining the question is as a learning experience. This way SE can update my skill level and update the difficulty and meta information of the question. With this closed feedback loop it can then continue providing me with questions which are relevant to my skill level. Once I'm at a high skill level it could then occasionally present me with questions which don't have an answer as well.</p>

When I wrote ""social features"" I was actually suggesting an alternative way to for users to share their knowledge <strong>using a new type of post and articles</strong> and not just by questions and answers. </p>

<p>The basics of my idea was to allow users to write articles on topics relevant to the community on the SE websites just as any answer posted is expected  to be too. Allowing users to write their own content (I.E posts/articles/etc..) will be granted as a privilege for advanced users so that not anyone could write stupid things, users that will write content must be established and well-familiar with the rules of SE. </p>

<p>I know anyone can start a blog, but it's require frequent maintenance and content updates, while writing on SE ensure that it addressed to a large, well-established community, with a similar fields of interest.</p>

<p>Posts writing will follow the same guidelines as asking and answering questions does, but it will provide an alternative for users that are mostly answering specific questions, as a new method to contribute to the community. </p>

<p>By writing, one may also reveal more about their personality, wit, way of thinking, ETC. That's when the ""social"" takes place - You'll also have ""authors"" and not just ""users"" you can remember by their catchy name, but people that you can remember by the field of interest they are writing content about. </p>

<p>They key points will be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Users will be able write rich content with advanced WYSIWYG HTML editor, content that doesn't require a question to answer, but that is still relevant to the SE website it is writing on.</li>
<li>Users will be able to Upvote/Downvote other users posts.</li>
<li>Posts will be listed on their author profile, so it will not just show the activity, but additional layer of user generated content.</li>
<li>Popular posts with high reputation could be associated to tags making the information of tags richer with user generated content</li>
<li>Users will be able to include links in answers not only to other questions, but also to posts.</li>
<li>User will be able to comment on post to allow the author to correct and improve it. It will improve the interaction and offline discussions (Which are prohibited when it come to long discussions on questions and answers).</li>
<li>I believe that users will be happy to share their own tutorials, tips and tricks - Because they are already doing so when answering questions, but before the can start, they'll have to earn enough reputation to ensure that only high profile users will be able to write high profile content, and not just any rubbish.</li>
<li>It will provide another type of method for voting and getting earning reputation</li>
<li>Users will be able to include content in their CVs on SO Jobs. </li>
<li>Opportunity to earn some new badges.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it's a Mega feature request and it require some detailed design work, but I do think that it will invite a new type of activity for users on SO (and the rests of the sites of-course).</p>

<p>It would be nice solutions were found avoid theses cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Legitimate cross-domain questions
The question can be related to domain A and B.
On A.stackexchange.com, people say it's off-topic and you should ask B.stackexchange.com.<br>
On B.stackexchange.com, people say it's off-topic and you should ask A.stackexchange.com.</li>
</ul>

<p>Real example: Ask a question about photography software. ""Software"" will say that only photographers use that specific software so you should ask ""Photography"". ""Photography"" will say that only software geeks know how to use software so you should ask ""Software"".</p>

<p>I think if it is a legitimate cross-domain question, the same question should be able to appear in both sites without cross-posting. By the way this should required some validation. I know, that's not a small feature change.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sub-domain topics
The question is about topic X in domain A.
People who know a lot about domain A but don't know topic X will downvote the question or tag it as off-topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those happen even if the [domain].stackexchange.com site has a dedicated tag for topic X.</p>

<p>As a result, specific questions tend to get closed by users who don't know the topic and therefore are not given a chance a to reach the small fraction of user who could answer them.</p>

"279334","Replace maximum age for migration with a better criterion","<p>As it was revealed in discussion with Shog9 in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/87031/reset-votes-on-migrated-questions/151893#comment880201_151893"">Reset votes on migrated questions</a>,</p>

<ul>
<li>the actual parameter governing migration eligibility is <em>""the ratio ""question value by the troublesomeness of irrelevant stuff in it""""</em> which is <em>""virtually equivalent to just ""amount of irrelevant stuff""""</em></li>
<li>the current criterion - the age - is a crude approximation to that parameter</li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/87031/reset-votes-on-migrated-questions/151893#comment436313_151893"">this approximation proved to be <em>too</em> crude</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, <strong>I'm proposing to replace it with a better approximation.</strong> An example can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>No more than X votes total (both up- and down-) on all non-deleted posts, and</em></li>
<li><em>No bounty in any state</em></li>
</ul>

<p>X of somewhere around 5 seems adequate. Acceptance mark can be counted as 1.5 votes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem it's intended to solve is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes, I come over a decent question/one with potential to give reusable knowledge, maybe even with decent answers, that has no future at SO due to being off-topic but could do so much better if only it was in the right place. Since decent questions are a precious rarity at SO, I don't want it to go to waste.

<ul>
<li>Since this happens the moment I come over that question, it can be two days or two years old with equal probability</li>
<li>They generally fall into two cases: 1)seen no activity on the source site, or 2)have been adequately answered but received few votes and/or downvotes due to being off-topic. Either may have been justfully closed as off-topic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since this is my desire rather than someone else's, it's my job to see it to completion, and I cannot expect anyone else to help me voluntarily (mods aren't strictly volunteers, they have signed up for processing requests) - so migration is the only option the system currently provides.</li>
<li>Likewise, it doesn't matter to me if the OP is still there and willing to give additional details.

<ul>
<li>If I see the question lacks critical details that it cannot be answered without, such a question cannot qualify as ""decent"" for me (as it means insufficient understanding/effort by OP). Thus the case of ""abandoned questions that cannot be answered without feedback"" is not a concern for the current suggestion.

<ul>
<li>But if it only lacks minor details (=leaves sufficiently little room for guesswork) or applies in the general case (=specific details are not needed), it's not a hindrance for handling it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since the OP posted it in the wrong place, I can assume I know better than them whether to migrate and where. In any case, the only way to validate this assumption is to peer-review my suggestion (currently, the system forces a mod to make a personal decision. All else they can do is consult other mods manually).</li>

"280488","Learning new languages - language translation for foreign SE sites","<h2>The idea:</h2>

<p>I've recently come to realize that foreign SEs give excellent opportunities to learn new languages.</p>

<p>For example, I am interested in learning Russian and I love programming so what better than <a href=""http://ru.stackoverflow.com"">http://ru.stackoverflow.com</a> ?</p>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>I'm new to Russian, but through very long language analysis and hard work, I have been able to successfully answer <strong><a href=""https://ru.stackoverflow.com/users/189258/avenoir"">two</a></strong> questions (I am quite proud). </p>

<p>On average it took me at least 45-60 minutes to answer each question.</p>

<p>The whole <strong>process</strong> is <em>very time consuming</em> (as expected!). </p>

<ol>
<li>I have to first decrypt the OP's question (longest part)

<ul>
<li>Find a way to copy the title (yeah try it right now.. title is a clickable link. Sometimes rather annoying to <strong>copy a word</strong> in the title !)</li>
<li>Copy &amp; paste word by word into google translate to get an accurate translation

<ul>
<li>I find that copying full texts into some translator doesn't always give an accurate translation and doesn't help with the learning process.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then I have to find a solution (shortest part)</li>
<li>Finally, I have to write an answer (long but fun part) !</li>
</ol>

<p>The programming solution to those questions were not hard in themselves, but to understand the question and to explain what I did was challenging. </p>

<p>That's the learning process no?</p>

<h2>The solution:</h2>

<p>Is to reduce the whole <em>comprehension</em> time process.</p>

<p>The main reason why it took so long to answer the question was to understand the question asked ! To copy and paste certain words to google translator (and other such sites). </p>

<p><strong><em>Imagine if I didn't have to copy and paste.</em></strong></p>

<p>This leads to the final idea, to incorporate a translation module to foreign SEs.</p>

<p><strong>API:</strong></p>

<p>Google proposes an <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API</a> for this (but of course not forced to use it, for you <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/translatorapi.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bing</a> fans out there, or whatever Translation <a href=""https://www.translationcloud.net/developers/documentation/what-is-translation-cloud-api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API's</a> exist out there)</p>

<p><strong>UI:</strong></p>

<p>Of course my vision of this solution is my own and I'm sure there are better idea's out there !</p>

<p>I don't think this option should be activated by default, it should located in <strong>Preferences</strong> in a user's <strong>Profile and Settings</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Q0whv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Q0whv.png"" alt=""image showing how to active translations""></a>
<em>Image showing how to activate translations. Only foreign stack exchange sites that the user is signed up on are shown.</em></p>

<p>The translation itself should be (<em>my opinion</em>) activated when the user <strong>hovers/clicks</strong> a word. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/aYugU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aYugU.png"" alt=""image with popup""></a></p>

<h2>The Conclusion:</h2>

<p>I know that SE wasn't originally intended in learning new languages (irony when you think of SO), but it <em>might</em> be an added value to the SE community (definitely not for me to decide!)</p>

<p>I would personally use this all the time.</p>

"281260","I have a (perhaps irrational) fear that brand-new users with auto-generated usernames may not return. Can I encourage them to change their username?","<p>New visitors to Stack Exchange can post questions or answers as a guest. The site asks them to specify their name and their email address.

<p>Email verification is a separate step. They must take additional actions in order to get an verification email sent to them. Then they must open the email and click the link.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questions"">help center</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closing is a democratic voting process where the community identifies questions that duplicate existing content, are unreasonable to answer in their current state, or do not belong on the site.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/help/site-moderators"">the same reference</a>:</p>

  <p>Moderator votes are binding. Any place we have voting — close, open, delete, undelete, offensive, migration, etc — that vote will reach the threshold and take effect immediately if a single moderator casts a vote.</p>

<p>I think these are in contrast with each other.</p>

<p>Regardless of their inherent contrast, I would like to refer to another situation.</p>

<p>Also the tooltip can be moved to Timestamp where it logically belongs. Timestamp tooltip can provide additional info, was comment changed(and may be when it was changed last time).

<p>I suggest the following: if a question is posted by a new user (defined as reputation = 1, or in any other convenient way), it should be hidden from the front page when it has even 1 active spam (or rude/abusive) flag.</p>

<p>Benefit: cleaner front page even during spam peak.</p>

<p>Potential objection 1: not as many users will see spam posts to flag them. But hiding them is the top priority, since eventual deletion is assured even after one flag (as a result of mod review, if nothing else). For those looking for spam, the /questions page is already preferable to the front page. </p>

"283559","Does ""topic"" have a special meaning on Stack Exchange, and should it?","<p>Often on at least some Stack Exchange sites you see people equate ""topic"" with any and all qualities of a question, answer, or comment, rather than just their topic in the usual English sense. Especially so in the phrases ""on-topic"" and ""off-topic"". Invented examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>This question is off-topic because it's a list question.</li>
<li>This question is too broad with too many possible answer to be on topic.</li>
<li>Recommendations are off-topic.</li>
<li>This question will just attract peoples' opinions so it's off topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I right or wrong to be bugged by this? Topic has a meaning in English. It's useful to distinguish the various things that can be wrong about a question, answer, or comment. Asking about boats on a programming site is off-topic. Asking to recommend some programming books in on-topic but it's not a good question for reasons other than topic.</p>

<p>It particularly bothers me when people vote to close a question and click the ""off topic"" radio button when the question has some real problem but is clearly within the scope of the site.</p>

<p>Taken to its logical conclusion, if we were to go with this new jargonish meaning of ""topic"" we would not need any close reason other than ""off-topic"". Are duplicate questions off-topic?</p>

<p>Also, how should we distinguish the two senses ""this post is a bad for for SE"" and ""this post is outside the scope of this SE site"". If a question actually is off-topic, how should we say so if people are encouraged to read ""off topic"" as meaning ""has one of many possible problems""?</p>

<p>Are we saying that ""on topic"" has a different meaning to ""with the scope""? Should it be so?</p>

<p>I would like to encourage people to use ""off-topic"" as a close reason only for questions outside a site's scope. And to encourage people not to be informed about what a question;s scope is and what its other properties are and how to know the difference between the various reasons a question or other post can be bad.</p>

<p>Am I just being a grammar Nazi or is there a meaningful reason to blur the meaning of ""topic"" on Stack Exchange?</p>

<p>It (my problem) usually starts like this: I'll begin by asking them to clarify their question in the comments, below their question. They'll answer back and say, so and so. I'll then post my answer to their question, based upon their feedback. </p>

<p>The problem appears when they say my solution/solutions does not work. I'll then ask them more questions depending on their response. Then we go back and forth. He'll say he's got another error or something is not working right, and I'll respond back by asking if he's sure he typed something right or he installed something correctly.</p>

<p>After about eight or nine comments, Stack&nbsp;Overflow will warn me that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are not for extended discussion; would you like to move this conversation to chat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I pondered whether trying to address the OP's extra errors (still somewhat related to the question) in the comments would be a bad idea. If so, wouldn't it still be a bad idea to tell him to edit his question to include his extra errors. If I or someone else had already answer the original question, him adding error questions would make other answers seem as if they just ignored part of the question or did not answer it in full. More so, it might seem like he was asking multiple questions in his post, which could also be bad/incorrect.'</p>

<p>You of course, have the option of moving the comment conversation to chat, but it seems that this method would be inconveniencing to the answerer if they did not have time or were not in a position to were they could have a full fledged chat.</p>

"284514","Make the ""delete-this-comment"" button available for everyone","<p>Currently, the only way to delete a comment is to flag it (e.g. ""obsolete"") and wait for a moderator to handle the flag. Or, if it is my own comment, I can just press the ""delete"" button.</p>

<p>However, when I try to press the ""flag"" button, I see this guidance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag this comment for serious problems or moderator attention</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes me think that <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/50809/237804"">I should use this button only when there are serious problems</a>. But most of the comments are not serious problems! I just want to remove that pointless comment that says ""OMG LOL"", or an <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/156127/237804"">obsolete comment</a>.</p>

<p>So, let's add a seemingly more ""streamlined"" option for deleting comments: just press the ""delete"" button! It would do the same - open a dialog that asks why I want to <strong>delete</strong> (not flag) the comment. Just a change of wording - no new functionality, but I think it looks more intuitive this way.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the ""delete-this-comment"" button available for everyone

<ul>
<li>Maybe only for users above a certain reputation threshold? I suggest the same threshold that allows <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges"">voting down</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Handle this the same as the ""flag"" button

<ul>
<li>Another option is to declare that moderators are less ""obliged"" to handle such flags; just delete the comment automatically if it gathers enough of such ""votes-to-delete""</li>

<p>A possibility is to <strong>place the date  of answer just under the vote count</strong> (and the upvote/downvote buttons). Or if the community feels there's not enough space and that'd be too much clutter, even just placing the year there would be great.</p>

<li>Sort questions in closed site by no. views (or votes).</li>
<li>Select most popular tag of top one</li>

<li>Add to a migration review queue in the site with most users, if queue>100 then offer to next site (if >1 site following).</li>
<li>Get next most viewed (or up-voted) question and repeat until some lower limit (views and/or votes) is reached. Pause if all queues are full (say 100).</li>
</ol>

<p>I imagine that there are some hidden gems amoungst the closed sites questions that probably warrant more exposure. </p>

<p>Use cases could include the Artificial Intelligence <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6607/artificial-intelligence"">closed</a> and <a href=""https://ai.stackexchange.com/"">open</a> versions, <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/47845/game-theory"">Game Theory</a> and <a href=""https://economics.stackexchange.com/"">Economics</a>, <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/23848/theoretical-physics"">Theoretical Physics</a> and <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/"">Physics</a>.  Perhaps the questions in those closed sites would be a good fit for other sites as well.</p>

<p>Finally, it might allow struggling sites to bow out with pride, knowing that their activity will not be <em>displayed in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/40705-but-the-plans-were-on-display-on-display-i-eventually"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beware of the Leopard</a>.'</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Give the user some reputation when they accept an answer for their questions. It might be useful for other users to see that the answer is working so giving some reputation points might be useful.</li>
<li>Another idea is to adjust the top bar and add an option which shows open questions asked by the user. Via that, they would constantly see a counter and be informed that there is still something open which still needs his attention. To avoid the counter growing as the user has more questions with no answer it might be useful to show only open questions from the past 6 months. Or this value could only show pending questions where the user didn't comment on answers. So if an answer isn't working for the user he could add a comment like ""it's not working for me"".</li>
<li>Another option might be to send out an email notification to inform the user that there are still answers which must be accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p>This might help us to improve the quality of questions and answers. As we then get more ""valid"" and controlled answers. Many users spend a lot of time and knowledge answering questions so I think improving the situation might be a win win for the community.</p>

<p>On the Internet the word <em>comment</em> has been widely adopted for a specific use, i.e., <em>(a place to) dump your opinion on someting</em>. SE comments are better than this. Rename them to <em>remarks</em> to avoid the confusion.</p>

<h1>What the dictionary says</h1>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Merriam–Webster</a> (boldface mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Full Definition of <em>comment</em> [noun]</h3>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong> commentary</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong> a note explaining, illustrating, or criticizing the meaning of a writing</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>a :</strong>  an observation or <strong>remark</strong> expressing an opinion or attitude <br>
  <strong>b :</strong>  a judgment expressed indirectly </p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Full Definition of <em>remark</em> [noun]</h3>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong> the act of remarking <strong>:</strong> <em>notice</em></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong> an expression of opinion or judgment</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong> mention of that which deserves attention or notice</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Full Definition of <em>remark</em> [verb]</h3>
  
  <p>transitive verb</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong>  to take notice of <strong>:</strong> <em>observe</em></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>:</strong> to express as an observation or <strong>comment :</strong> <em>say</em></p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>intransitive verb</p>
  
  <p><strong>:</strong>  to notice something and comment thereon —used with <em>on</em> or <em>upon</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as far as the dictionary goes, the distinction between <em>comment</em> and <em>remark</em> – as far as it applies to Stack Exchange – is a subtle one at best.</p>

<h1>What the dictionary doesn’t say</h1>

<p>What the dictionaries fail to capture (because it’s only slowly affecting how we perceive the language) is that the word <em>comment</em> has been used by various Internet platforms for a feature that allows every user to express their opinion or whatever they like on whatever was posted – mostly unmoderated. This leads to most comment sections on the Internet being a read-only dump for the unfiltered mental outpour of attention addicts. Youtube comments have already become a stock comparison, signifying the bottom of the Internet. (Just in case you are not familiar with them, the introduction of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_discussed_YouTube_videos"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Wikipedia article</a> manages to illustrate the nature of Youtube comments very well.)</p>

<p>Stack Exchange comments are better than this, yet it is inevitable that a considerable number of users expect them to be like comments elsewhere on the Internet which results in confusion. An extreme example is <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4069/i-despise-the-workplace-thanks-to-the-admins-who-move-comments-to-chat/4070#comment10619_4070"">this comment</a> (in a Meta discussion on deleting comments):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a very unclear policy and if that is the case then comments should be renamed to ""clarifications to question..."" come on the point of comments is to make a comment. When I see a button to add a comment it means I want to comment. You will need to change the user interface if comment isn't and doesn't really mean comments. You'll have to go to each and every answer across all the SE sites to impose such a horrible idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Some considerations</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Apart from the work to implement this, the only downside of this that I can think of is the possible confusion of new users when they see old posts referring to comments. However, as comments are rarely referred to an the main sites (and should be ephemeral anyway), this should mainly affect Meta, where most users either are aware of this anyway and can be informed via tag-wiki excerpts and similar. Moreover, SE survived renaming <em>offensive</em> to <em>rude/abusive</em> and <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/"">Not Programming-Related SE</a> survived even two renamings, so I am quite confident that this will be a minor issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally this happens simultaneously with a UI change such as the ones discussed <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/256967/255554"">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If somebody has a better suggestion than <em>remark</em> (that is still generally understood, not too fancy or too restrictive), …</p></li>

<p>It would be easy to detect when the user types 'wordpress' into the title, or when he selects 'wordpress' as a tag for the question, and create a popup message accordingly - asking (or even forcing) the user to go to wordpress.stackexchange.com.</p>

<p>As I believe it would be quite easy to enforce, my question isn't why don't they try, it's more 'why don't they care'?</p>

"287576","Make ""Move to Chat"" automatic, moving all comments. Direct all further comments to the chat room and enable OP notifications","<p>The manner in which comments are moved to chat on ""noisy"" websites is incredibly disruptive.  It goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Several comments are moved to chat by a moderator and linked to the chat room.</li>
<li>More comments are written under the post.</li>
<li>Moderator returns and deletes all of the new comments, leaving a new comment ""Comments cannot be moved to chat twice.  Any further comments will be deleted.""</li>
</ol>

<p>The workflow for moving comments to chat is very haphazard.  You never know when the ""would you like to move this conversation to chat"" link will appear, and when it does, it doesn't actually <em>move</em> the comments, nor does it ""move"" all of them.  This is also true of moderator chat conversions.</p>

<p>The policy of deleting further comments because they can't be moved into the chatroom is just terrible in so many ways.</p>

<p>So here is what I suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When the number of comments under a given post reaches a certain, <em>site-specific threshold,</em> move all of the comments to a new chatroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave a link to the new chatroom under the post.</p></li>
<li><p>When the ""Add a comment"" link is clicked, redirect to the chat room.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn on OP notifications in the chatroom, so that folks asking for question clarification will get attention from the OP.  Alternatively, allow the OP to be addressed directly in the chat room, even if he hasn't commented previously.</p></li>

<p>I suggest to monitor questions with [too] negative scores whose score elevates and reach zero or positive (<em>See note 1</em>), then from the participating down voters, a set amount of RP be deduct as a compensation (<em>See note 2</em>).</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Setting some restrictions may be meaningful though, such as the elevation be made during limited time and limited number of revisions made meanwhile.</li>
<li>With a rationale similar to when we loose reputation on withdrawing some of our previous actions (e.g.: un-accepting an answer).</li>
</ol>
<h3>In Reply to comments / answers (NEW)</h3>
<p>The 30 min culture of returning back to the down-voted question mentioned by <em>Patrick</em> is a nice behavior and if the majority of users would behave so, I would not need to suggest the feature. The point that <em>Dan</em> emphasizes upon could solve the problem of asking terrible question then editing it back to be an excellent one, but the constraint could more specific and for example limit the number of changed bytes instead of number of revisions.</p>
<p><em>Glorfindel</em>'s point for reverse situation is still a good subject for discussion.</p>
<p>The points that <em>Cai</em> and <em>Patrick</em> mentioned, also hints me to some replacement feature request:
<em>auto-annulment of un-confirmed down-votes after 30 mins for re-edited posts</em> (Posts with down-votes if edited sooner than elapse of 30 minutes from the down-vote keep that vote only if it is confirmed by originator after the edit happened).</p>
<p>Now lets go to benefits. This mechanism could improve voting quality. That is one would not down-vote a question that could be fixed with a very minor change. In other words, if you see a very minor mistake, fix it instead of down-voting it (the originators are still able to nullify the change if it diverges the question from their intention because of such fixes or keep it if it is improved).</p>

"288468","""Value for other visitors"" as a criterion for good questions?","<h2>Original question</h2>

<p>I have seen a number of questions on different Stack Exchange sites where it was suggested to close the question for various reasons.</p>

<p>One argument/criterion that I have never seen was ""will this provide value to other readers""?</p>

<p>In my understanding, the main purpose of a Q/A site like this is to attract people who have a question in mind, and provide them with useful answers.</p>

<p>A question should contain the search terms for people with an equivalent problem, and the answer should address the expectations of visitors attracted by these search terms.</p>

<p>Solving the actual question author's specific problem is only a side effect, or a necessity to make this system work.</p>

<p>I wonder if the criterion of ""value to other readers"" can play a stronger role when deciding whether a question is relevant.</p>

<p>Some questions that were under threat of being closed for ""opinion-based"" or ""asking for a tool"" actually end up being upvoted a lot, and providing a lot of value for readers.</p>

<p>I suppose it is subjective, and maybe not suitable as a hard formal criterion by itself. But it seems, from my limited experience, that it should play a bigger role than it currently does.</p>

<p>Background: I spend most of my time on programming-related Stack Exchange sites. I also sometimes read the ""Hot Network Questions,"" and see that other sites like Parenting (for example) produce valuable content despite the inevitable subjectivity.</p>

<h2>Notes for clarification</h2>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a request to soften any specific rules about subjective or ""shopping list"" or any other type of questions.</p>

<p>The real goal was to discuss about the underlying goals when designing such rules.</p>

<p>The idea is to make ""usefulness for readers"" one (but not the only) criterion when designing rules for a stackexchange site.</p>

<p>It may very well be that the current system already IS the optimum in terms of usefulness, and we don't have to change anything. E.g. one could argue that subjective questions lead to answers that are not useful.</p>

<p>It is also possible that what I propose is already being done, and I simply missed it so far.</p>

<p>Now ""useful"" itself is a subjective term. So let's clarify.</p>

<p>Firstly, ""useful"" should always mean ""useful within the intended scope of the respective stackexchange site.""</p>

<p>The stackexchange network is useful to readers, if</p>

<ul>
<li>readers understand what to expect, and what not to expect, from the stackexchange network.</li>
<li>readers with a question in mind find a (unique) sub-site and a (unique) answer within a (unique) Q/A thread, which sufficiently answers the question, or contains a hint which question should have been asked instead. This is implies that

<ul>
<li>scope and focus are important</li>
<li>duplicates are bad</li>
<li>findability is important</li>
</ul></li>
<li>there is a stream of clueless visitors that are being funneled to a place of illumination.</li>
<li>Coverage: Most questions that <em>can</em> be answered effectively in a Q/A format are covered somewhere in the stackexchange network.</li>
</ul>

<p>A stackexchange site is useful to readers, if</p>

<ul>
<li>readers understand what to expect and what not to expect to find on this specific site.</li>
<li>readers that have questions within the scope of the site find either sufficient answers, or they learn which question to ask next.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Q/A thread is useful to readers, if</p>

<ul>
<li>the question expressed in the thread is equivalent with the question the reader has in its mind.</li>
<li>or if not, the reader will quickly understand that this is not what they were looking for.</li>
<li>the answer addresses the points that the reader was looking for.</li>
<li>readers leave with a better understanding of the subject.</li>
<li>most of the useful information is at the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>A question is useful to readers, if</p>

<ul>
<li>title and keywords attract readers with an equivalent question in mind, e.g. via web search or in-site search.</li>
<li>the question leads to a useful Q/A thread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usefulness is not the same as popularity, as has been pointed out in some of the answers. But upvotes often indicate that many visitors are curious about the same question.</p>

<p>I imagine that all of these thoughts are already being considered implicitly. Maybe even explicitly somewhere. I just have never seen such arguments being made in everyday discussions about whether something is a good question. So I suspect that sometimes these goals are being lost.</p>

<p>This can lead to a situation where some curious visitors are left in a ""dead end"" where they find neither an answer, nor a constructive ""ask something else"" or ""look somewhere else.""</p>

<p>Its totally fine if no one goes there except people posting buggy code. If that happens, then we'll have demonstrated that it isn't worth anyone's time to debug those questions. The point of my proposal is to make it easier to REMOVE those posts from stackoverflow (SO), in a gentler way than deleting them...</p>

<p>Currently, such questions clutter SO, and people get SO rep for answering them, if their answer is accepted. IMHO would be better if no one got SO rep for answering questions that shouldn't be on SO in the first place. Having a mechanism for quickly moving the question off SO would accomplish that, and would better signal to people asking, that SO is the wrong place for such questions.</p>

<p>Currently, people often enough get ""rewarded"" for their crap questions, by receiving an answer, that they have motivation to ask such questions again. Also, other people see those questions get answered, and think it is appropriate to ask similar questions.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to make it easier to kill off these questions. But I thought having a place to move them to was a gentler approach.</p>

Instead of shouting to new users, ""HERES THE HELP CENTER"", how about we make it more accessible to any users. Similar to Shadow Wizard's <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/289525/make-the-10k-tools-page-more-visible"">answer</a> where he suggested to add the 10k tools page directly into the topbar rather than hidden in the review page, why can't we do that with the Help Center link?</p>

<p>The Help Center is well placed under the <code>help</code> tab but I think it should stand out more so users can access the very useful articles quicker, in a sense of speed and early in the starting stages of their ""Stack Exchange lives"":</p>

<p>As Mego also said, the change is relatively simple and should be easily established. So can we add the Help Center link directly to the topbar so it is more easily seen by users and more accessible? Or at the very least, shown somehwere else that is more visible than the <code>help</code>?</p>

<p>But all I know is that I flagged for mod attention. I don't know what I wrote, or what exactly it was about, and I don't want to cover something twice (for the obvious reason, and as to avoid the impression that I'm copy-pasting a flag, because that's annoying to them and doesn't get the flag done faster).</p>

Though it may be a proper way to make a verbatim copy of ""about me"" section to the new community instead of leaving it blank, I think it is not desired always (or maybe mostly). Let me explain how:</p>

<p>We've many categories of sites viz.: Technology, Culture/Recreation, Life/Arts, Science, Professional, Business etc. Now, <em>""about me"" on different site of a different category would be obviously different!</em> In addition, some users also write different ""about me"" on different site of the same category.</p>

<p>So, shouldn't we just keep blank ""about me"" section of new joining community instead of copying it from doest account <em>without prompting</em>?

"290444","Edited on-hold questions should give notifications to the close-voters, and not just put in the re-open queue","<p>Some users may vote to close a question and then perform other tasks, ignoring that question.</p>

<p>Other people might indeed give a few suggestions, but may find the question is getting multiple edits or updated frequently, so they might decide to, say, perform other tasks again and then perhaps return to the question to check on its status, assuming they do remember to return to it.</p>

<p>There might be more possible cases, but my point is, in either of the two above cases, one cannot assume said users will go and check the re-open queue. They might think the question's core idea doesn't fit on that particular SE and perhaps no amount of edits can save the question, they might think OP keeps editing the question to attempt to improve it and they're still not satisfied with the question for some reason, so they may keep their vote to close and ignore the question, etc. What I'm trying to say is that <em>users who vote to close should not be automatically expected to remember to retract their vote once the question has improved to a satisfactory enough level.</em></p>

<p>The re-open queue has its advantages: It's already an established feature, and works in conjunction in a good way with the other queues as well. Possible disadvantages may include: Users not being aware of the existence of said re-open queue (I was not really aware it existed, as an example, and if I was, I may have probably forgot about it back then), and it requires the users to remember to go to the queue, which I think not all users might remember, perhaps especially users who visit it only once in a while.</p>

<p>Therefore, I propose that, when an on-hold question is edited by the OP, all the close voters are notified of this through the usual notification system, since I think it is a more visible place than the re-open queue.</p>

<p>Maybe there should be a sort of reasonable (i.e not too short, not too long) ""cooldown"" between notifications, for on-hold questions that are edited  on a more frequent basis, and maybe a similar system could be used for closed questions rather than just on-hold ones, but that I think is best discussed in other meta questions once consensus is first gathered on this kind of ""main"" meta question about it.</p>

<p>A <strong><em>temporary</em></strong> suspension for <strong><em>10 years</em></strong> with roughly 8 years remaining.</p>

<p>Firstly, is 10 years temporary? I hardly think so. You don't say you temporarily lived in a place for 10 years or you temporarily worked in a company for 8.</p>

<p>In many developed countries, manslaughter only carries 1-2 years imprisonment. If a criminal is locked up for 10 years, it's definitely not temporary. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the definition given by <a href=""http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/temporary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cambridge Dictionary</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>not lasting or needed for very long</p>

"294899","What is the point of showing publicy a new user's question vote count more than -1?","<p>Mostly I am on Stackoverflow.com where new/experienced programmers share their knowledge. When a new user asks his first question, the question can be downvoted because the user's question is a bad question. They do not read the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask"">https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</a> document which helps users to ask a good question.</p>

<p>Now what is the point of the possibility of downvoting a new user's question if it is already -1? Example: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43494459/how-to-save-a-picture-in-camera-roll-with-a-custom-nam"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43494459/how-to-save-a-picture-in-camera-roll-with-a-custom-nam</a>. A question which has now -8.</p>

<p>Of course, there are a few things about the user's question that make it a bad question. But why can users downvote a question if it is already -1? What is the point of showing -8? The point that the question is bad is already indicated by the -1 (note: only people with 125 reputation can publicly downvote a question). </p>

<p>I feel -8 does not have any added value to the user itself. I think when he sees the -8 he just leaves the website or anything other than positive. It is now like: <em>""Hey man! Bad question! Here, have a downvote!""</em> <strong>times eight</strong></p>

<p>Especially for new users, I think it is important that a review should be made when the question received a downvote. The question should be on hold and ""normal"" people should not be able to downvote/see the question. When the review is made, the mod can decide that the user should rewrite his question to make sure people see it again. I already thought this was possible, but I think it is a great idea to not bash away the new user, by simply spam downvoting his question. </p>

<p>Remark: the above tells me that (eg) User3 <strong>voted</strong> to reopen this question, and looking at the consolidated report about all such votes for all those 5 users, is what appears to me like I'm &quot;browsing (a report) about how each user voted (to reopen or to leave closed) as part of this review.&quot;.

Otherwise, I don't think it's correct that people standing on huge rep. levels and appearing as &quot;reputative&quot; SE profile owners (because of high rep) just for asking a question <code>where is console.log() shown..</code> 10 years ago.</p>

"300736","Explicit citations and references in questions and answers on Stack Exchange websites","<p>Most of the answers (and questions) on Stack Exchange websites do not cite external resources or references (papers, official websites regarding a specific topic, Wikipedia, etc.), like for example Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>The contents of an answer are usually the result of the knowledge of the author of the same answer (and the reviewers). This makes these answers not always reliable, even though the votes this answer may or not have received may help in understanding if those contents are actually reliable. In reality, these votes tell us more about the number of people that share or not the ideas on those answers, the number of people that find or not those answers useful, etc. So, the voting system is clearly useful, but highly depends on opinions.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to add an explicit system to cite external resources/references while writing answers and questions, similar to Wikipedia's one.</p>
<p>Let's take <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/605858/3924118"">this answer</a> as an example where this explicit system to cite external resources/references would be useful.</p>
<p>The author says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No; you don't cast the result, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is unnecessary, as <code>void*</code> is automatically and safely promoted to any other pointer type in this case.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement could cite, for example, the C standard, where that's explicitly stated (if there's such a place). This would clearly make this answer more reliable.</p>
<p>Overall, this citation system would make Stack Exchange websites even more reliable, which, in my opinion, would be an improvement. The citations do not have to be enforced, but they could eventually be required (by any user), in a similar way that this is usually <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_needed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">done on Wikipedia</a>. Eventually, this idea could be extended: a template system could be created; other types of templates could be introduced.</p>
<p>Why or not would this be a good idea? How difficult would it be to implement this?</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong></p>

<p>I suppose I have my answer!  I've seen evidence of Stack Overflow members sometimes taking things a little <em>too</em> seriously (in my opinion), and even belittling OP's who haven't done enough research before posting a question -- but <em>I do acknowledge</em> that it ultimately leads to a golden source of quality information, free of pointless spam or questions that have been answered numerous times.</p>

<p>So this isn't the place for ""recreation"".  Gotcha.</p>

<p>One example of what I'm looking for is the 'nonprofit collaboratione' piece.  I'm building a web tool, ad free, intended to be a resource to make life easier for a certain segment of developers.  I posess the background skill on the topic, however I'm just not learning web design as quickly as I would like (I'm not 20 anymore!), in order to complete this project in a reasonable timeframe/quality level...  whereas it's probably a matter of an hour or two of the right person's time (and I would <em>absolutely</em> be learning in the process, and credit would be gleefully shared).</p>

<p>Another, related example is related to graphic design:  I am not very artistic so I've done a ton of research into possible visual layouts for this site, and I have a half a dozen idea I'm considering.  Sadly I don't have anyone 'IRL' to give me feedback on my potential designs, plus I'd rather focus on coding as opposed to art.</p>

<p>Honestly I'm afraid to even clarify these things, for fear of being shunned for ""seeking free labour"" or such!  In trying to seek alternative sources of information, I posted a link to a survey a couple weeks ago, basically asking for input on what people would like to see in a site like that.

I know that user, he always answers with many details, plus I know he's one who shares a lot of his knowledge on other websites with high quality web articles. </p>

<p>So I went on to other high rep users and discovered they also asked very few questions (for example a user with <strong>60k for 8 questions</strong> only!).</p>

<p>I felt <strong>those users deserved some kind of reward</strong> for being <strong>great answerers</strong>.</p>

<p>The rule would be something with a high rep based regarding to their asked questions rate. I don't know this website enough to make up a good rule, but I felt it might be something like that.</p>

<p>Why <strong>Wise</strong>?  Because they have a lot of knowledge (they don't need to ask questions) while they share it a lot (""<strong>helper</strong>"").</p>

"301661","What is the Stack Exchange community's stance on digital anonymity?","<p>Although I understand the site hosts information and that information in itself should not be censored, looking at tor.stackexchange.com it seems that a sizeable number of questions are related to using privacy for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>While tor, bit-torrent, etc have legal use-cases in themselves, I would argue that these and similar tools are far more often used for breaking the law than 
with legal intentions.</p>

<p>And with some of the information that tor.stackexchange makes available, technically Stack Exchange is facilitating illegal activity. (Though I should mention that I would struggle to do without the Stack Exchange network in general).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/14727/why-arent-the-biggest-bittorrent-file-sharing-sites-using-tor-yet"">Why aren&#39;t the biggest bittorrent file sharing sites using Tor yet?</a></li>

</ol>

<p>Considering questions like the above and more, what is Stack Exchange's stance on digital anonymity if one can assume that such anonymity will be used at least to <em>some</em> extent (with questions like the above definitely indicating to a <em>larger</em> extent) for illegal activity?</p>

<p>Also, considering that sites like Stack Exchange enable people to be anonymous digitally, SE should definitely have a stance!</p>

"302137","Is there unconscious bias against new users on Stack Exchange?","<p>As a mid-level bulk-of-the-curve SE participant it's impossible for me to not notice how moderators seem to express distinctly negative and shut-out behaviour to both Qs and As where the user has one or two digit rep.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone has experimented with concealing rep (maybe making the rep number a hover or some such trivial concealment) and if a trivial delay or obstruction to view user-rep would change the statistics on hold/close/down-votes?</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know if the value/relevance of many Qs &amp; As <em>changed</em> upon learning a user's rep. </p>

<p>I'm wondering if this assertion has ever been tested on any of the SE networks?</p>

<p>If I'm honest with myself I'm conscious that I use the user's rep as a way of valuing a Q or A -- internally part of me momentarily resists making a judgement until I look at the bottom-right thumbnail and number. I'm going to assume consciously or not I'm not the only person who does this.</p>

<p>Perhaps if a step is required to view the rep of the user Asking/Answering it may inform whoever is looking that rep is being used as a factor in them valuing the Q/A and that they're not being completely objective.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: FWIW I originally had something in this question about being nuked from space for asking this question and sure enough, that's happened.</p>

<p>I teach in a CS department in one of the best universities in the world and am quite involved with the local tech community consensus among students, academia and professionals is that getting involved with SO is a waste of time. </p>

<p>To my 3rd/4th year CS and SE students this place is impenetrable. </p>

<p>I actually ask in my classes if any of my students are active on SO. So far the answer has been ZERO, which has been really surprising. Vast majority haven't even bothered making profiles. That's the future of SO.</p>

<p>This question has really reinforced that, I mean I've been on SO for more than 8 years and speak up and rather than discussion, get completely shot down out of hand. It's difficult for me to believe a high-rep/diamond user would have the experience.</p>

<p>To behavioural economics (more Dan Ariely) this place is loaded with conflicts of interest and moreover in my experience any calls for introspection are very poorly received, which again is basic human psychology, but SE seems to be particularly lazy with new users.</p>

<p>I trust this question was asked 2 years ago by a high-rep user:

<p>Assuming that said comment is eligible for being copyrighted, which is not always the case.</p>

<p>When a moderator edits another person's comment only the name of the original author appears. It is noted that the comment has been edited but that is indistinguishable from a comment which has only been edited by the original author. </p>

<p>It would be fine if the comment read ""Comment based on original Work by Original Author"" as the license states. Indeed this would be an acceptable alternative to disabling comments.</p>

<p>CC-BY-SA 3.0 states a way in which credit for adaptations my be given and also states that <em>"" You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above""</em>. So in that manner and only that manner.

When I asked him what he'd changed to make it work, since I'd tried several times to no avail, <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/41435181#41435181"">he said (in chat)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the <strong>original link</strong> was incomplete, <strong>just began with the domain name:</strong> <code>rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/A/alliteration.htm</code>
  I wanted to add <code>https://</code> but due to space constraints ended up just adding <code>//</code>
  Protocol-relative links are not the best choice especially when linking to other pages on the site. Because the site actually tries to recognize such links and add them to the sidebar, and protocol-relative links sidestep the link recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the problem is <strong>Markdown doesn't link-ify <code>(foo)[bar]</code>-style links if <code>bar</code> doesn't start with a protocol</strong>.</p>

<p>This seems wrong to me. So, questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given the syntax <code>(foo)[bar]</code> explicitly and literally says ""I want you to render a link here with text ""foo"" and target <code>bar</code>, why is a protocol required on the reference?

<ul>
<li>Why can't the Markdown be rendered as <code>&lt;a href=""bar""&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;</code> and defer the protocol selection to the browser (which are built to resolve such ambiguities)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am not aware of any documentation on this limitation. Browsing the top <a href=""/questions/tagged/markdown"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;markdown&#39;"" rel=""tag"">markdown</a> questions on Meta doesn't reveal anything relevant. Are SE users expected to be aware of this limitation? If so, is it imposed by Markdown, SE's selection of a particular variant of Markdown, or SE's implementation?</li>
<li>Can we lift this restriction? If not, why not? If it's a security issue, why can't we defer resolving such security risks to the browser?</li>

"303969","Provide text hosting for long contextual text-files supporting a question","<p>One usability issue of Stack Overflow is that the first answer to a question is often several page-scrolls away from the top of a page. In between you may get large areas of code-snippets that maybe should not be there, but nobody is there to clean them up, stacktraces, logfiles, explanations about context, and then a trail of comments (about how the question is too long).</p>

<p>This is in contrast of the promise of the Stack Overflow About page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask questions, get answers, no distractions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also some people host text files on other sites, but that has the risk of the question becoming useless because the linked content does not exist any more.</p>

<p>While it would be nice if people could be motivated to spend hours optimizing screen real estate for their question without losing important detail, it might be better to give them a quick way to add files as attachments so that they do not block the space between the title and the first answer.</p>

<p>When I was looking at the Winter Bash 2017, I saw that there was a hat designing contest. I thought that when you did the achievement to get a hat, you actually got it; I was totally motivated to go and earn some hats. But later on, I was talking to a friend about how cool it is that you can win real hats, but he said you don't actually get them, they just appear on your profile picture.</p>

<p>That's great and all, but I think that SO should take hats one step further and actually give away hats. Wouldn't that be awesome, walking around with a SO hat? Then you could take your profile picture actually wearing the hat, too.</p>

<p>Shipping away real hats might cost SO a lot of money, so maybe there could just be a few, harder to achieve hats. Or, maybe a mastery hat of like over 10k rep or something. Or a real hat that you earn only if you have every single virtual hat unlocked.</p>

I can only presume people who do this are IMHO pretty uptight, given an answer has been proposed in all honesty that looks like it is intended to help others. </p>

<p>By letting an individual give a negative, Stack Exchange leaves itself open to abuse, with valid comments from other quarters slating Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>As Stack Exchange professes to be committed to good answers, should they not counterbalance this with the attitude that a negative response cannot be generated without the backing of others in the community?</p>

<p>I.e. an individual gives a negative vote which may or may not be generated by a peevish response to an answer given to a particular question, however a negative response given by up to, say 5 people, pretty much negates this type of behaviour and makes the negative value of -1 for 5 votes a valid response from a community.</p>

<p>I did mention positive scores too, as we see in Stack Exchange where a visible positive vote has been given others will follow with more positive votes on that one answer, despite there being better answers posted afterwards.</p>

<li>is the ""real"" link => doesn't cause unnecessary page reloads (e.g. if pointing to another post of the same Q&amp;A)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This results in a dichotomy for users, as they have to decide each time which of the properties are more important for them at the moment.</p>

<p>(I personally almost always choose the normal one: link rot is a serious problem on the Web so I don't contribute to it; I don't use space-constrained media like Twitter; links that lead God-knows-where and page reloads on jumping to another post of the same Q&amp;A are damn annoying and I'm not someone who would violate the Golden Rule.)</p>

<p><strong>Now, all of the listed link properties are important. And they aren't mutually exclusive</strong> (except the shortness). <strong>So, why do I have to choose only half of the benefits and lose the other half each time if it's technically possible to get all at once?</strong></p>

<p>Tech-wise, it doesn't look like rocket science to concoct something unambiguous.

<p>I would even propose to make this the default link sharing format <em>(this is a separate concern, however, so vote on this separately, please)</em> since space constraints are nowadays mostly a non-issue.

The bonus is awarded because you have proven that you know your way around the basic features of any Stack Exchange website and have demonstrated you are a good community member through being awarded community votes for your questions and answers. With those 100 extra points you can now comment, vote, flag and create bounties on all SE sites. From here on out, on any new sites joined will also be given this bonus.</p>

<p>I think this is an excellent award that promotes sharing of skills/knowledge between different sites without the painful earning of basic privileges. </p>

<p>I'd like to hear from the community whether they think the Association Bonus could be expanded to include accounts that have earnt over 500 reputation on their up to 5 sites (for example), or some other variation. Surely >500 reputation on up to 5 sites would demonstrate that the user has provided a useful contribution to the Stack Exchange network, and is equivalent to >200 reputation on a single site?</p>

<p>The aim of my question is to reward Stack Exchange users that spread their effort over multiple sites the same Association Bonus privilege as a user that dedicates their effort on a single site.</p>

<p><strong>Declaration of Bias</strong></p>

<p>I joined the wonderful Stack Exchange network 2 years, 10 months ago. I have been contributing to various sites when I get the time. I am a Stack Exchange evangelist amongst my friends and family because I find Stack Exchange is a system that somewhat recognises the time and effort of people who ask a question well or provide thorough answers.</p>

<p>However, while I would love to vote on answers and questions the numerous Stack Exchange sites, I have not yet managed to achieve the elusive 200 reputation to gain the afore-mentioned Association Bonus on any single site, because I have spread my effort over multiple sites. Unfortunately I often see this note when I try to vote on other sites:</p>

<p>My top four sites have a combined reputation of 600. My progress on each site is somewhat slow since I also have a bit of a penchant for answering old unanswered questions. I'll confirm this for anyone wondering, that this is not a good way to build your reputation quickly! I have also realised that some of the sites I frequent tend to be technical so many questions/answers on any given day have zero votes (e.g. Arduino) compared to other sites where there is not one question on any given day that does not have a vote, and many have over 5 (e.g. Interpersonal Skills) (i.e. reputation seems to be harder to earn).</p>

<p><strong>Edit (a few months later)</strong></p>

<p>Thanks all for the encouragement. I finally managed to find a few questions I could research answers for. The reputation boost made my eyes pop, until I realised that was total for all the sites I am a member of.</p>

<p>Same case applies for up-voting also, users don't read the post completely and would up-vote it and these votes (up/down) will decide the quality of the post.</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree that the down-vote can be cancelled out by another up-vote or vice versa, but what if a good answer was down-voted and someone else up-voted it, so that answer's score will be 0 where it should be 1.</p>

There are plenty of questions addressing this as a problem:</p>

<p>And plenty more. It occurred to me that while specialization (through fractionation of Stack Exchange to multiple sites) is a good thing, but only if the specialists spread themselves around. Often a grad students or scientists can contribute to Stack Overflow, math, the other math, stats, maybe another site etc. The problem most have a main or a couple of (science) sites they enjoy contributing to, and won't be aware of questions on other sites. For me Stack Overflow seems like an aggregation of such knowledge, making it very annoying to ask a statistical question that will either be answered within a day on Stack Overflow, or closed for migration - depending on luck - while posting on cross-validated may not get more than a few views over weeks.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92834/allow-tagtag-name-syntax-to-link-to-any-site"">Allow [tag:tag-name] syntax to link to any site</a> almost addresses this, but that would require both a lot of effort when asking a question, plus you need to know to link to other sites particularly.</p>

<p>I ** (previously - edit below)** suggested making tags cross-site as a rule, that is, changing the default rule when registering to all site. This way subscribing to a tag will alert to any related question on any site - and maybe entice a pro who wouldn't normally visit to contribute. Tags are a loose grouping as it is, and it seems a shame to force someone asking on growth rate of some bacteria to miss out on advice from people on mathematics exchange. I can't see an advantage to dividing tags to sites either - if you don't want to see minecraft alerts in your feed, don't sign up.</p>

<p>If you think this is a bad idea I'd be interested in what advantage is there to keeping tags split.</p>

<p>PS:
Maybe adding the fake Internet points as a cumulative sum (in addition to per site) can help as well, but I don't think it is as important.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion</strong></p>

<p>Following the comment by @rene, I suggest creating <strong>default tag groups</strong>, so when registering to Python on Stack Overflow, you would register to Python on SU and stats (for example) as well. I suggest this as a default behavior to allow new contributing users a global view by default of suggested tag. No one is going to use filtering by default, not to mention looking for possible relevant cross-sites. <strong>This can't be universal</strong>, since Python may appear in a future cool-animals.se site - inspired by the Apple comment of @rene.</p>

"306600","Award part of reputation back to bounty owner","<p><a href=""https://serverfault.com/questions/894252/sogo-with-zentyal-addc"">This is</a> the question I'm talking about. I'm the OP, the bounty owner, the only one who answered and there aren't any real comments too.
Wouldn't be safe to allow awarding part of bounty reputation back to myself (the bounty owner) in such cases? </p>

<p>I did all the hard work after all and reported back my findings to the community.</p>

<p>I think there's no risk I set another bounty on that question after recovering part of my reputation, thus artificially drawing more attention to the question, because there already is an accepted answer and because I still loose some rep each bounty I set. However maybe that, just now, opening a new bounty on that question would be technically possible for me anyways, but, even then, I think it's easy to make the system avoid that possibility: when the OP is allowed to award himself part of the bounty  rep (only in selected cases like mine above), and he does so, his question is automatically closed. </p>

<p>This feature would encourage OPs who set a bounty to find the answer themselves (which I suppose they already are, admittedly, since they set a bounty), and to report it back to the community when the question hasn't received any other answers. We shouldn't understimate that last bit of knowledge sharing: there are so many unanswered questions here I harldy believe the OP really didn't find a solution for any of them. I'm more inclined to think the OP did solve its problem somehow, but he didn't bother to share the knowledge. </p>

<p>Maybe the system could make this feature available to the OP only after the bounty expired, and only if the question hasn't received any other answers except the OP's one, so that we are sure none else would have replied anyway.</p>

<p>The conditions this feature would be available could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>The OP is the bounty owner</li>
<li>The question has only one answer</li>
<li>The OP is the answer author too</li>
<li>The answer has no downvotes</li>
<li>The bounty has already expired</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case I think letting the OP recover 50% of the bounty points would make sense.</p>

<p>It's like booking a flight after all: if you cancel the reservation you get something back, because for the company is better to return you a part of your money and KNOW they can sell that seat to someone else, rather than keeping all of your money and leaving the seat empty, just because you didn't bother to let them know, since you had nothing to loose.</p>

<li><p>This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Clearly, the request to close is a prerequisite to mark the question as ""belongs to another SE site"". But we know that SE sites are not mutually exclusive, for example Cross Validated, Data Science, and Stack Overflow have a lot of intersections. For example, when somebody asks a question about how to implement a certain statistical algorithm, statisticians, data science professionals and computer scientists can help. So there might be cases where a question is better suited for one of these sites, while the best option would be to keep the question in the one it is originally asked in as well.</p>

<p><strong>So there might be cases where a ""replicate/cross-post"" would work better than ""migrate"", simply because the question is not off-topic, but is in the intersection of multiple SE sites, and naturally belongs to more than one.</strong></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be better if we had the following two flags:</p>

<ol>
<li>Close and migrate</li>
<li>Keep open and migrate</li>

"307961","Is SE inclusive of young users?","<p><strong><em>tl;dr: propositions in bold italics</em></strong></p>

<p>On the one hand, quality control is paramount for SE success, so posting guidelines need to be adhered to. New users are often unfamiliar with SE rules. This can sometimes result in a somewhat blunt response to homework questions, for example. Although this often happens in complete agreement with SE guidelines, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9953/could-we-please-be-a-bit-nicer-to-new-users"">this nevertheless has already been highlighted as an issue</a>. Similar <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130558/can-we-cut-back-on-the-is-this-homework-berating?rq=1"">discussion about homework questions</a>. </p>

<p>Taking this a bit further, I speculate that this may lead to a significant number of younger users who are alienated by this ""harsh"" response, especially children who have decided to join the community and made a first clumsy post. Personally, I have the impression that the average age of users posting their first question is dropping, especially on certain forums (I'm thinking of Chemistry, but that may be just a feeling, I have no data to back that up).  </p>

<p>I feel that SE should be as inclusive as possible in regards to potential young members, and that it would be a significant loss to the community if their interest is bashed away by an indiscriminate policy (for me, this is especially objectionable in SE's scientific branches). I realize that SE's core idea of up/downvoting posts does not bear an offensive quality, but that's an adult concept. SE has grown <strong>far</strong> past its bare core and now faces the delightful perspective of answering kids' questions. Something to be cherished, I'd say. </p>

<p>User anonymity makes an age-based response impossible. Therefore, I'd argue for <strong><em>a set of ""canned answers""</em></strong> for the most obvious breaches of SE rules (most notably, homework questions that don't show effort) that are formulated in a friendly manner and invite further participation. Maybe they can contain fields that need to be filled in, like links to existing answers. </p>

<p>Alternatively, maybe it would make sense to create <strong><em>a rule that requires some basic form of friendliness in all answers</em></strong>, especially those mark the question as inappropriate? This seems harder, because friendliness is a subjective quality. </p>

<p><strong>Your question should contain the details of your proposal</strong>, including a justification of why the new feature is needed and/or how it can improve the community. Basically, prove to the administration that they should spend time developing your feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378/173299"">XY Problem</a> is generally against the question being about the &quot;proposed&quot; solution:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's not to say that what the XY Problem answer also states:</p>

<p>[EDIT: <strong>Addendum</strong>—while I've clearly had a number of downvotes by people considering this question as not researched/clear/useful, because of this Q &amp; A, the tag information has been updated to be more clear about the fact that a feature-request should still generally <em>not</em> be offering a solution in the question, as much as defining the problem one thinks a solution is needed for; then any solution one has is best put as an answer to one's own question.

  <p>Yes, you can share an account if you want. It's not like we can tell who's using it, so it wouldn't be practical to enforce a rule to the contrary. But by doing so, you assume the implied risks: misbehaviour from one user could ban all of you, or they could steal the account. You won't get any special support if this happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/82510/134300"">""What is the view on accounts shared by multiple users on Stack Overflow?"" (2011)</a>, by jjnguy (former SO moderator):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why not?  Just because more than one user may manage this account doesn't devalue their contributions.</p>
  
  <p>Do you really want to force people to verify that their account is used by the same person every time?  I'm not sure if that is even possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This same thread has a post from Shog (current community manager) <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/83035/134300"">explaining why we don't need to treat this as a distinct case from individual accounts</a>.</p>

<p>In 2012, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/130325/134300"">Korneel Bouman</a> (then a Stack Exchange Product Manager) gave a user instructions on how to share their account with coworkers.</p>

<p>We have several existing high-reputation accounts that identify as company names, not individuals (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/380926/devexpress-team?tab=profile"">example</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware"">example</a>), and I am in no hurry to ban them.</p>

"309609","How to deal with defamations perpetrated through public chat rooms?","<p>I must premise that the present OP, albeit motivated by a personal experience on Mathematical Stack Exchange, aims to solicit an open discussion about an important general issue concerning the common rules for a fair behavior in formulating comments on public chat rooms here on the Stack Exchange network.</p>

<p>For that reason, please do not focalize on the specific cases I'm referring to, but consider those just as a concrete example to better guide the discussion about the main questions.</p>

<p>Recently I have been suspended for 7 days for a comment in which I've expressed my own opinion about the lack in correctness and honesty by one user in his/her action on MSE. That comment has been considered rude and not tolerable by MSE Moderation Team, leading to my first suspension in 5 months of experience here.</p>

<p>Here below the message I've received on April 22 at UTC 6.18 PM from MSE Moderation Team to notify the suspension.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/BPly1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/BPly1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I fully respect the decision made by MSE Moderation Team, indeed my comment was of course out of place and eligible for some punitive/corrective action by the MSE Moderation Team. </p>

<p>What I can't really understand is why the same criteria for the suspension were not applied to a deliberate defamation action against my person perpetrated by some users and posted on public chat rooms named CRUDE and Math Mods Office which, I presume, are not aimed to manipulate someone else's reputation.</p>

<p>I’m referring notably to the following deliberate and reiterate public false accusations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First remarkable defamation on March 15 2018 at UTC 2.00 PM on Math
Mods Office chat room</p>

<li><p>Second remarkable defamation on April 21 2018 at UTC 6.17 PM and
8.11 PM on CRUDE chat room</p>

<li><p>Third remarkable defamation on April 22 2018 at UTC 6.17 PM and 4.06
PM on Math Mods Office chat room (2 hours before suspension decision)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/dLCKU.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/dLCKU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Notably my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why a rude but extemporaneous opinion given during an open debate by
a comment can lead to a 7 days suspension while a purposeful,
deliberate and reiterate public senseless accusations (i.e.
defamation), perpetrated through public chat rooms, which should be
aimed to different scopes, can be tolerated and allowed by the
community?</p></li>
<li><p>Is that abusive use of the chat rooms compatible with the fair harmony of the
community?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I overestimating that issue?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've formulated almost the same questions to the MSE Moderation Team after my suspension, but up to now I didn't receive any reply about that.</p>

<p>With reference to the abusive use of chat room, I’ve received the following reply from SE support.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Hello,</p>
  
  <p>This kind of behavior is not forbidden in a general sense, but it has resulted in problematic behavior in the past. Ultimately, it just requires keeping a close eye. Most of these groups across our network operate in a way where they only target clearly bad questions or answers, staying away from more subjective materials. If a group ever becomes abusive and starts closing clearly good questions or doing other things that become problematic to the site, the moderators can always step in and intervene.</p>

"309678","Apply a reputation loss for posting the 1st comment at any post","<p>There's a lot of complaint recently, about the culture of Stack Exchange sites, and how newcomers feel unwelcomed, or just feel being minorized when asking questions.</p>
<p>One source of these complaints are snarky and unnecessary comments placed on posts (no matter which quality they actually are):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Do your homework please!&quot;</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>&quot;What did you try?&quot;</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>&quot;Here's what I found at google as the 1st hits: &quot;</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>&quot;What on earth are you talking about?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the above examples are already addressed well (doesn't mean there could not be improvement regarding tooltips, auto notifiers and on hold/closed banners), and that kind of comments just tend to make new users upset about the commentator and start biased and off-topic discussions.</p>
<p>I believe that applying a small reputation cost (similar as for downvoting answers) of -1 or -2 for the 1st comment written at any post (be it question or answer), could radically help to reduce that kind of mostly useless (and unconstructive) noise.</p>
<p>That would also encourage users to think twice, and either to write a comment with that initial cost, or an answer which has a chance to start with 0 cost and getting upvoted.</p>
<p>There are already reasons why comments containing the key acronyms RTFM<sup>1</sup> or LMGTFY<sup>2</sup> are considered rude and unconstructive.</p>
<p>While could be considered as helpful to some degree, these will leave OPs with a belittled and blamed themselves in the public feeling.</p>
<p>That's just not necessary, we have better tools to teach new users. Those ones who don't care to read further, will be lost anywhere anyways.</p>
<p>Duplicate (auto comments) must be handled as a special use case, and either be refunded as accepted, or at least left neutral against reputation.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear what pros and cons you otherwise could see for such feature.</p>
<hr />
<h3>For the record:</h3>
<p>It is quite interesting to see by the scores of this FR discussion, how hard some people are defending to keep their gameified internet reputation points over a possible regulation (i.e.: just to give something away in the game, getting trustfully social, pay for attention, show your responsibility), whatever it be.</p>
<p>If I can't be convinced that the community here is able to do better into that direction, instead of not just going into charge by thinking from the other points view, this is probably not the place anymore I thought I've been joining once.</p>
<hr />
<h3>One of my prejudicable ...</h3>
<p>(that's probably a word invented by myself) ... statements is according to <em>Groucho Marx'</em> great statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd probably better stick to that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Driving and teaching new users to post better quality questions shouldn't be left to commentators, also the close vote mechanics need to hit OPs at a certain threshold, and need to be more thoroughly explained.</p>
<p>I am already bothered (and I believe I am not the only one) for looking like an ice cold robot for this.</p>
<p>I don't want to loose the transparency carried on with close votes, though also made proposals to anonymize and improve this (see a FR <a href=""https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8744/wouldnt-it-be-more-useful-to-notify-ops-automatically-about-close-votes-instea"">here</a>), and also asked about <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/222473/in-which-way-the-op-is-notified-about-close-votes"">clarification</a> earlier.</p>

It’s Time for That to Change</a>"" article, I have a feature suggestion that would help users write good questions that are less likely to be shut down by the community.</p>

<p>The article has me in two minds;</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, it does stink when you try to come up with a good question, only to have it closed/down voted/dissed in the comments.</li>
<li>How are people feeling they are being singled out when there is no real way to know that someone is a woman or a minority or even if you happen to be a dog. </li>
</ol>

<p>As it says, hurt feelings are hurt feelings and you can't argue with that, but maybe we can get to the root of the problem, instead of focusing on the symptoms?</p>

<p>Namely, a lot of people just don't know how to ask a good question. The article talks about one plan in reguards to SO specifically, in that you'd have a textbox for your question, another for code snippets, etc. in order to help users format their questions in a useful way. </p>

<p>Another option that some sites have started using is to have a meta post that is used as a sandbox. A user can type their question in there as an answer, and get feedback on how to word things better or deal with potential problems in order before it hits the main question list and gets torn apart.</p>

<p>The question sandbox idea has several problems though; namely you have to have a little rep in order to post in there, which is hard for a 1 rep newbie, and you have to know it exists. Not all sites have them, and the ones that do can be hard to find on the meta question list.</p>

<p><strong>The proposal:</strong>  </p>

<p>Add a new ""sandbox"" review queue, and an option on the Ask a Question page to submit your question to the sandbox queue instead of the main site.<br>
I am aware that the main goal of the site is to ask a question easily, and get answers quickly, but that does not work if the question gets closed or a lot of negative feedback.  </p>

<p>I personally would have used this feature a few weeks ago, when I was trying to figure out if my question would be well received on DataBaseAdministrators, or if I should put it on StackOverflow instead. I really wasn't sure which would be better.<br>
So I went into the DBA chat and asked the users if my question would be a good fit. But that's a lot of steps, if anyone is in chat, and you have to have 20 rep to use chat which won't help a new user. </p>

<p>I think that any tool we can give new users to better understand how Stack Exchange works is a good thing.</p>

<p>There are two possible explanations, if the user upvoted already then it must be someone else downvoted it. So there's one more possible exception.</p>

<p>We must be able to see how much upvotes and downvotes every post has, next to the total 'karma' of that post. After that, we can be sure of the karma of the question; I believe this will be a very useful feature. </p>

"309993","Allow gold badge users to ""propose"" duplicates, to give the author a chance to contest the proposed duplicate","<p>Please note: this is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231504/how-do-i-opt-out-of-privileges"">How Do I Opt Out of Privileges?</a>, which asks to give gold tag badge holders the ability to cast normal close votes in case they're not sure of their vote. I understand why that request was declined, and while it is true that implementing that request would solve this problem as well, the reasons I'm proposing are totally unrelated to the reasons given there and the declining reason.</p>

<p>Recently, I've been seeing users complain when their question gets closed immediately, without warning, by a gold tag badge holder. Unlike votes from normal users, where users are shown a notice to consider the proposed target and edit if they don't think it's a duplicate, users aren't shown this option.</p>

<p>Now, users can edit their post, which will add it to the reopen queue, but new users don't really know about this. They can also leave a comment @reply to the user who closed the question, but their name isn't shown as one of the possible users to ping (unless they commented).</p>

<p>I'd like to propose a new system that can be used at the <strong>discretion</strong> of the gold badge holder (meaning they can opt for a standard binding closure if they like), to simply <em>propose</em> duplicates to the author. In my mind, this would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave a standard ""Possible duplicate of [link]"" comment</li>
<li>Insert the normal notice at the top for the author only, with the link, an option to close it themselves, and an option to edit</li>
<li>Put the question into the Close Votes queue, where other users can review it to see if it should be closed, in case the original closer doesn't come back</li>
<li>Give gold badge holders the ability to bindingly close later on should they choose</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be implemented as a standard close vote, or (my preferred way) a recommend closure flag, but without a flag (to prevent gold badge holders from inflating their helpful flag count). A recommend closure flag adds the comment and author-only notice and puts the question into the CV queue, which is exactly what my described feature does.</p>

<p>While this is partially accomplished by simply leaving a comment with a link, the link can be hidden if there are other comments, and a duplicate link will get posted if someone later votes to close it as a duplicate. I've seen moderators on Travel do this, but I've also seen a lot of redundant comments from users later voting or flagging to close the question.</p>

<p>I believe this feature will help increase the overall inclusivity of Stack Exchange, since users are sometimes offended by immediate closures, and in some cases think of the closers as simply ""satisfying themselves"" because they don't know the answer.</p>

<li>Newb tries to comment and is denied</li>

<li>Newb adds non-answer to the question</li>
<li>Folks come along and downvote the answer. </li>
<li>Newb adds comment ""why are people downvoting me???""</li>
<li>Folks leave comments (some welcoming, some short) telling newb this is a comment, not an answer</li>
<li>Newb responds ""but I can't leave a comment! I'm just trying to help!""</li>
<li>Downvotes continue. People vote to delete. Maybe a mod helps.</li>

<li>Repeat 10k more times</li>
<li>Drama-nado eventually swallows all life on earth</li>

<hr>

<p><strong>That</strong> seems like a very unfriendly and unwelcoming outcome to a new user's first interaction!  </p>

<p>If newb was already marginalized, I'm sure newb would think themselves marginalizedier. I heard some folks were concerned about that kinda thing.</p>

<p>I dunno, I've been a little out of the loop, was there some kind of blog post about it? Shoot me a link, k? Nobody hooked me up last time I asked :(</p>

<p><em>So</em>, instead of flat out blocking newb from commenting, let's let newb comment and short circuit this cluster. </p>

<hr>

<p>When they press submit on their comment, a modal dialog is shown <em>with a countdown in the lower left hand corner</em> and an <strong>""I understand"" button</strong> in the lower right. The button is disabled until the countdown reaches 0.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are intended only to ask for clarification. They are not for extended conversations, for thanking people, for stating that you also share the same problem, or similar purposes. Users with less than 50 reputation are presented with this dialog and must wait the required period of time before they submit their comment. You can gain reputation by asking good questions, providing good answers, or by editing posts to make them better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Include an algorithm to increase the wait times when the user creates comments too fast. For example, start with a wait of 10 seconds. If they add another comment within a minute, the wait is now 20 seconds. Again, 30 seconds. Let this wait decrease over time if no comment is added. If, for example,  they don't comment in the next three minutes they're back at a 10 second wait.</p>

<hr>

<p>Possible benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>New users who try to help don't get slapped in the face</li>
<li>New users who aren't well versed on how comments work (bloody all of them) get an education</li>
<li>New users get onboarded quicker, and are able to get reputation faster</li>
<li>Questions are more likely to get answers</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spammers will use this to bypass the block</li>
<li>Without server-side control, hackers would be able to use userscripts to bypass, making the implementation a bit harder</li>
<li>More crappy comments will appear</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Feature update and comment about spam: Considering this is supposed to be for users trying to answer a question, in order for &lt; 50 rep folks to get this dialog,</p>

<ul>
<li>The question must not be old (let's pick an arbitrary number like a week)</li>
<li>The question must not have an accepted answer (maybe any answer? Play with that in testing)</li>
<li>The OP of the post must not be a deleted account</li>
</ul>

<p>As for spam... I just don't believe spam would overwhelm the comment systems. I've never even seen a spam comment. Seen hundreds of spam questions and answers, both of which a 1 rep user can add. Forcing a spammer to sit through a modal in order to add his spam when they can do it instantly... no though.</p>

<p>Yes, we don't have good spam detection tools for comments. No, I don't think it's anywhere near reasonable building them. Obviously, if the hose is turned on, and instead of that sweet, cool summer hose water we get a throatful of spammy diharriha, you can always turn off the spigot. You wasted some development time, but you did so for a good cause. And who hasn't been blasted in the face with a good old squirt of liquid brown before? You lived.</p>

<p>As for the dupe target, this hasn't got anything to do with losing rep for commenting. And neither of the answers apply to this question. So nah.</p>

"310308","Possibility to ask anonymous questions","<p>The Stack Exchange network has been growing a lot in the past couple of years. By now there are many sites that are about potentially sensitive topics. One that comes to mind is <a href=""https://workplace.stackexchange.com"">https://workplace.stackexchange.com</a> or <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com"">https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<p>I've seen many questions on those sites that probably should be asked anonymously (as in ""not traceable to the real person""). Now some users, including me, prefer to go by their real name. We are virtually unable to ask those kinds of questions. Even if you anonymize your account for a certain site, you are still traceable due to your overall profile. I guess many of those users have a second account for such things.</p>

<p>I think a nice feature would be the possibility to ask a single question anonymously. I imagine a feature like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can mark a question/answer as anonymous when posting</li>
<li>Question/Answer is not traceable to your account by other users. This has to go both ways (from viewing the post or your profile). Maybe it appears in your profile anonymized to display reputation and badges.</li>
<li>From your view the question/answer is still linked to your account as you are used to.</li>
<li>You will still receive reputation for those posts, if possible even badges. I realize this introduces the possibility to trace the question back to the user by metadata. But I doubt that it would be feasible in practice (You'd have to look through every user looking for the one with the matching reputation points gain).</li>
<li>Possibly marking past posts as anonymous (would enable a anonymous user to shift to real name)</li>
<li>Maybe making the feature configurable per site. I guess there is not much need to ask anonymously e.g. at Stack Overflow.</li>
<li>Bonus feature: If you already have a second anonymous account you can migrate it to your ""main account"".</li>
</ul>

<p>As I'm a developer myself, I realize this is a very complex feature for a relatively small subset of users. But perhaps more users would go by their real name if such a possibility exists. Also it might also proof useful to pseudonymous users because you might be able to connect them to the real person in some way.</p>

</ul>

<p>I'd like to draw some attention to that banner. Here it is, written out in full:</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know, Stack Overflow collects some information about you. You can see what information they've got about you <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/prediction-data"">here</a>, and opt-out by the same link.</p>

<p>This banner is shown to all visitors of the site, not just those who are signed in. And I'd like to draw your attention to the first sentence, which has finally tripped my internal heuristics for whether to trust a site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This site uses cookies to deliver our services and to show you relevant ads and job listings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This message is shown <em>to users who aren't signed in</em>. Is Stack Overflow really collecting data on users who never explicitly consented and are unable to opt out without creating an account, then using this data to target advertisements? Using <em>cookies for this purpose</em>, as opposed to just for authentication, strongly suggests that Stack Overflow is, indeed, collecting data about unauthenticated users. If anybody had asked me three months ago, I would have given Stack Overflow the benefit of the doubt... but now I'm not so sure.</p>

<h1>The bigger picture</h1>

<p>There's a trend here. Every single one of these changes benefits Stack Overflow more than it does the rest of the community. Some of them seem to have honourable intentions, such as the Text Ads, but the majority go against the perceived ethos of the community as a whole or are directly detrimental to the community or the resource we are creating together.</p>

<p>Please don't continue this trend. As much as I never wanted to say these words, I want the old Stack Overflow back. And I don't want to wait before that's not possible.</p>

<p>where a user A posts a question, user B posts what they believe is a helpful and correct answer, and user B ends up being downvoted and penalized because they answered a ""homework question"" (one where the downvoters think that the OP didn't at least try to solve it themselves first).</p>

<p>User B ends up being annoyed at this because they read the rules and didn't think they did anything wrong. Even if user B thought user A might be penalized for asking a question without making more effort first, user B reasonably assumed they would not be punished for <em>answering</em> the question.</p>

<p>One problem is that when you start typing in the answer box, the pop-up that appears says:</p>

<ul>
<li>Answer the question.</li>
<li>Don't ask for help or clarification or respond to other answers.</li>
<li>Don't post pure opinion without backing it up.</li>
</ul>

<p>(This is the pop-up that appears, with minor variations, on chemistry SE, math SE, and physics SE, so I assume it's from some template re-used across many SE sites.)</p>

<p>But the pop-up doesn't say anything about ""Don't answer homework questions"" (or ""Don't answer questions where the OP didn't do any work themselves or explain where they got stuck"", or more generally, ""Don't answer questions that are likely to get put on hold""). So the user reads and follows the directions, but they still get penalized and they don't know why.</p>

<p>This is part of the general issue of how to make the site more welcoming. It's not a case of ""n00bs didn't read the rules"". It's ""New users read the rules, but they got penalized for violating unwritten rules which are well known among the members of the community, but are not in the written rules.""</p>

<p>TLDR; let's put something in the pop-up which appears when you're typing an answer, saying, ""Avoid answering homework questions (questions where the OP did not first attempt to solve it themselves and explain where they got stuck).""

<h3>An example:</h3>
<p>Earlier today, I was reviewing a code project on Code Review. It took about one and a half hour for me to list the problems the code had and write another shorter version.</p>
<p>However, when I finally had finished debugging the code, I went back to the editor only to see that the question had been <strong>deleted</strong> (not closed) by the original poster. I was annoyed, to say the least.</p>
<p>I tried to contact the original poster via one of his other thread on Stack Overflow. He hasn't responded yet. Fortunately, I have managed to keep the question and original code so if I really need to I could just publish another thread making the question my own.</p>
<p>This can't happen! We're encouraged to write detailed answers not only showing the solution but also explaining it to the original poster.</p>

<h3>Proposal:</h3>
<p>I know that when a question gets published the poster can delete his post as long as he hasn't received any answers:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/vATeZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vATeZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>If the user wishes to <strong>delete</strong> his question and another user is in the process of answering it I believe there should be a message prompted like:</p>

"311454","By default, place questions asked by new users 'on hold' and visualize them as 'drafts'","<p>As a moderator at <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/"">Psychology &amp; Neuroscience</a> for over 6 years (a site with particularly stringent requirements on 'how to ask'), I have formed a pretty good impression of the 'typical lifetime' of questions asked by new users.</p>
<p><strong>The original question <em>almost always</em> requires elaboration</strong> which is requested through comments and in the majority of cases attracts legitimate close votes. (It would be interesting to get some statistics on this.)</p>
<p>From then on, I recognize two typical paths: <strong>(1) If the OP is very receptive</strong>, the question is edited before it gathers sufficient close votes and it remains open. However, <strong>much more commonly (2)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OP argues the comments are irrelevant, even though they merely express the expectations from the site. (e.g., but how can X be off topic on a site called y?)</li>
<li>Experienced users guide the user on how to: live up to site-specific guidelines (e.g., formatting, citations), make the question more specific, edit questions as a cohesive whole, etc.</li>
<li>Skepticism and feedback is interpreted as hostile. Phrasing such feedback politely only gets you that far ... (today I had a user delete his account and blame me for applying 'positive psychology')</li>
<li>The ill-phrased question starts attracting bad 'answers', or answers which become obsolete once the question is edited (sometimes resulting in 'back and forth' editing of question/answer).</li>
</ul>
<p>... as a result, <strong>the question often ends up 'on hold'</strong>, awaiting edits from the OP to address issues highlighted in the comments before it can be reopened.</p>
<p>Although the rephrased close reasons (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/125255/157047"">I am proud to have helped introduce</a>) are definitely a great improvement, having a question put on hold still produces many of the original negative responses <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/125255/157047"">I outlined before</a>.</p>
<h2>The suggestion</h2>
<p>Place new questions asked by users with less than a certain amount of reputation 'on hold' by default, <em>but</em> make it look more welcoming than the current banner which appears for questions which are put 'on hold' (e.g., <strong>rename it as 'draft'</strong> or 'under review', change the color, etc ...). I particularly like to name it 'draft' since it very much reflects what typically happens (many subsequent edits are required). The message could state something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to <em>Stack Exchange</em>! To ensure you receive a useful answer to your question you might be asked to elaborate on specific parts through comments. You can do so at any time by clicking 'edit'. This will only be necessary in case your question leaves out important details, which would make it hard to answer your question meaningfully. If not, your draft question should be approved in no time!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implementing this could be as straightforward as introducing a new 'draft' close reason (non-selectable when manually putting a question on hold).</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/185530/157047"">&quot;Should questions by new users have to be approved before becoming generally visible?&quot;</a> is related, but asks for questions to be hidden until approved. Instead, I suggest to reuse the current 'on hold' mechanism as part of which questions remain visible.</p>
<p>I <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/108674/157047"">found another suggestion</a> which advocates restricting voting on and searchability of new questions. I do not suggest introducing such additional complexity.</p>
<h2>Argumentation</h2>
<p>I understand the concept behind being inclusive and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/185532/157047"">only imposing restrictions on posts after they have been posted</a>. This line of reasoning, however, assumes that the majority of questions asked by new users do not need intervention. My personal observations indicate the opposite: the majority of questions asked by new users do need intervention (hence also the introduction of the review queue).</p>
<p>Essentially, a 'on hold' by default mechanism does not prevent new users from posting. What it does do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent the question from being 'answered' until certain it can be answered.</li>
<li>Align clear expectations with the OP that only questions which live up to the site guidelines are accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a <em>psychological perspective</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>New users seem to feel like they have every right to post the question—<em>they know best</em> since they are asking, so obviously it is a valid question—and when somebody doesn't like it they can move along. When a couple of high-rep users point out shortcomings it is them they blame, as opposed to the rules which govern the site. An up-front restriction (and clarification) imposed by the site would make it much more clear it is not just 'those few people commenting' they are arguing against.</li>
<li>It could inverse the negative dynamic which is created by having a question put 'on hold'. Rather than having a question be put 'on hold', <strong>having a question be 'approved' acts as a reward mechanism</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>Although I listed this as a <a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a>, there are several implications which would also need to be discussed. Some I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The review queue would need to be reshaped to <em>approve</em> questions, instead of putting them on hold.</li>
<li>This should not discourage expert users from commenting on questions to clarify how they should be improved.</li>
<li>The users would need some feedback to know when/if their questions is being considered to be opened. The 'reopened' votes could be recast as 'approved' votes, and I imagine it should take less than 5 votes for a question to be approved; maybe as few as 2.</li>

<p>The poster couldn't really explain his problem any better in my opinion (he is asking it the first place since he doesn't understand why it happens), and it is sufficient for people having a knowledge of the standard. It is also a good question in my opinion as the related C behavior which the MISRA standard is guarding against is now very well understood (neither the way MISRA is guarding against it).</p>

"312633","""Possible duplicate of"" comment should automatically edit into ""Related"" when the closure fails","<p>When user flags or votes to close as a duplicate, a ""Possible duplicate of [question]"" comment is auto-generated on their behalf. When the closure succeeds, the comment is automatically deleted. But when the closure fails, the comment remains there as it is.</p>

<p>The comment is still useful in the sense that it establishes a link between the two questions (so they appear in the right sidebar). They might not exactly be duplicates, but they are definitely related to each other. </p>

<p>However, because the comment was added automatically as part of the closure, it certainly is no longer needed once the closure is over. It should be deleted, or better, edited into ""Related"" form.</p>

<p>Thus the suggestion is that the comment of the form <code>""Possible duplicate of [link]()""</code> should be automatically edited into <code>""Related: [link]()""</code>  once the dupe closure for that particular <code>link</code>ed question fails.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> IMO, saying that a question is a ""possible duplicate"" of another question is not the same as saying they both are ""related"". There can always be two <em>distinct</em> questions about the same closely <em>related</em> topic (like <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/16922/5026"">this one</a>). <strong>A failed duplicate closure indicates that the questions were so closely <em>related</em> to each other that they were mistaken as a duplicate.</strong> </p>

<p>Wikipedia offers some ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Barnstars</a>"" which are a different but complementary award mechanism to SE's badges. The key differences are that badges are awarded <em>by the system</em>, and <em>automatically</em>, whereas barnstars  can be awarded or credited to one user <em>by another user</em>, at <em>their discretion</em>. </p>

<p>This is a sort of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiLove"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikilove</a> feedback, which is related with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikiquette</a> Among these barnstars, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:The_Random_Acts_of_Kindness_Barnstar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Random Act of Kindness Barnstar</a> is a valuable one, which is awarded for doing a help without being said, or taking the load of a lengthy help operation.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to create a parallel system of ""barnstars"" to complement the existing badges, where <strong>barnstars are awarded user-to-user at discretion</strong>, and to install the ""Random Act of Kindness"" barnstar as the inaugural award, which can be presented by a user to another to acknowledge voluntary, unsolicited good works on behalf of others, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>help in chat, </li>
<li>helpful comments, </li>
<li>edits and improvements to posts, </li>
<li>migrating question to more appropriate community with specific expertise, </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So, my question is, How would it be, if we adopt such an award for Stackexchange?</strong> </p>

<p>It could encourage people to help others and be gentle. Also the person who gets the help would develop a habit to acknowledge helps they received.  And people who like do help to others will get a recorded feedback.  </p>

<hr>

<p>N.B. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many Stackexchange members are often afraid of ""help vamps"", and I suspect a question may arise if this activate help vamps? In this matter, my opinion is, a simple and little award for doing help, <em>will not develop more help vamp behaviour</em> because we the volunteers could still be able to avoid a  lengthy help request, or to leave the task for some other volunteers, or to explain what could be the proper place for asking, or to explain why a particular type of help can not be done. </p></li>
<li><p>I have doubt on the concept of ""help vamp"", because not all help seekers are help vamps, and there is no realistic way to distinguish who is real help vamp and who else is real help seeker. Often a person skilled in some field of expertise may be unable to basic use of computers/mobiles (such as some elderly people) or a highly skilled technical person could have a cognitive trouble at some level. </p></li>
<li><p>There is a structural difference between upvote/ticks and barnstar. Upvotes and accept-ticks are signals for quality/clarity of particular questions and answers. They are not for acknowledging helps including chat helps, comment-helps, edits-and-improvements, moving question to more appropriate community, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>There is a structural difference between badges and barnstars. A wiki-barnstar is awarded by another user. Badge is not awarded by another user but it is based on automation. Also, you could easily measure the numbers of contribution or number of edits through an automated bot, but a bot/formula won't be able to which one action is help and which one action is not.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a functional and psychological difference between Wikibarnstars and Stack Exchange votes and badges. <em>Barnstars (and other Wikiloves such as kittens, cup of coffees, cup of tea etc) are more of a sort of ""gift"" than a voting or reward-earning mechanic</em>. Earning a badge or score evokes greed and competition (at least in me), but Wikiloves (including barnstar for random act of kindness). It only puts an acknowledgment of one user to another for doing help. </p></li>
<li><p>I do not necessarily propose the barnstar as a ""absolutely new feature request"". We can adopt the psychological qualities of an Wikilove by slightly modifying the existing feature (such as creating few badges that only one user can gift to another user). </p></li>

However, especially in Code Review SE, the first page can be filled with questions that are <code>[on hold]</code> for a while (due to bad formatting/phrasing/lack of context) that the next unanswered question is already found on the second page. </p>

<p>Also, in most cases, questions that are <code>[on hold]</code> rarely get follow-up editing. Putting them together with the newest questions makes the Newest tab just cluttered with questions that aren't actionable.</p>

<p>It would be nice to either:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I acknowledge and agree that I am an independent volunteer moderator to [site] and <strong>I am not an employee, agent or representative of Stack Exchange Inc.</strong>, and I have no authority to bind Stack Exchange Inc. in any manner. Stack Exchange Inc. reserves the right to terminate my privileges as a moderator at any time without warning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this paragraph obviously doesn't apply to SE employees who gain diamonds by virtue of their employment, and since the agreement is a legal contract, such employees are thus not bound to that particular agreement.</p>

<p>Given the specific privacy expectations outlined in the agreement, it makes common sense that all moderators should abide by it, no matter how they get their privileges, whether it be via a community process or by gaining employment at SE.</p>

<p>Are employees subject to a similar agreement? Is it part of their employment contract? Or is there another agreement to sign, since we have a lot of staff members who aren't moderators? If there is another agreement, how equivalent is it to the community moderator agreement linked above? If they aren't subject to any such agreement, are they generally expected to abide by it for ethical reasons?</p>

<p>Finally, if there is an agreement, what sanctions can be taken against staff members who violate it? Is it immediate cause for being fired? If not, if their position doesn't require moderator privileges, will they still continue to be non-moderator staff members?</p>

<p>After reading over the restrictions for username changes (paraphrased here):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Can only change username once every 30 days</li>
  <li>Can change username within a 15-minute grace period of the last name change</li>
  <li>Accounts younger than two days old can change name freely</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>After some testing, I discovered a logic flaw in this algorithm. You get a 15-minute grace period every time you change your username. This includes username changes that were within the grace period of another change. This effectively means one can bypass the 30-day restriction by constantly changing one's username, making sure that each change is within 15 minutes of the last.</p>

<p>The ideal way to solve this problem would be to add in a ""true"" grace period (just like post edits), instead of simply checking to see if the last change was within 15 minutes. But that seems too technical, and I also see some good reasons for allowing for a new grace period for every change. However, users shouldn't be able to abusively bypass the limit. I can imagine a user writing a script to keep changing their username in the background, so as to allow them to manually change it whenever they please.</p>

<p>The feature request: The author of a question should be allowed to ask for disassociation from any question that they have asked. This is an ethical issue, but also a policy issue.

This practice is actually detrimental to lower throughout Stack Exchange network sites. As such, moderators and other trusted users should be permitted to pin the asker's answer when circumstances allow for it. Ideally this should take place under some form of peer review, but the feature would ensure that well written answers by the asker are not penalized and that reliable information continues to be promoted. </p>

<p>While this situation doesn't come up very often, the throughput situation is pretty clean. Case and point, on <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/"">Skeptics.SE</a> it can actually take considerable time for an answer to accrue enough votes to rise to the top (ex., <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17171/did-a-us-court-rule-that-the-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism/17172#17172"">5 years 2 months, 22.5K views, 36 upvotes</a>, contrast with SO, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52625161/why-does-a-java-class-compile-differently-with-a-blank-line"">19 days, 12K views, 300 upvotes</a>). As a result, high quality answers by the OP might actually be ignored by readers.</p>

<p>In terms of why this feature exists, I seem to recall it was discussed on the podcast back during the beta testing (2008 time frame). The short explanation was that the current system is basically a compromise. They didn't want to you self-accept since they wanted to encourage Q&amp;A, but they also wanted to encourage people to write up unusual situations for the record, or note when they found their own solutions. One problem is that they also didn't anticipate that SO would expand to topics outside of programming so the system doesn't work as well across SE as a whole.</p>

That specifically refers to high-profile requests that receive a lot of votes, and the answer there addresses that specifically. This, on the other hand, is for more minor things that don't receive lots of votes and views, that the SE team deems of low priority. Additionally, the ""response"" there refers to a decision and a status tag; this, on the other hand, refers to something to the effect of ""we're looking into/discussing this and will make a decision regarding status"".</p>

<p>Sometimes, when people post a bug report or feature request here on meta, the SE team decides it's of lower priority, and decides not to respond to it for the time being. More than likely, they place it onto their internal issue tracker and possibly give it a ""low"" priority.</p>

<p>But from the outset, it <strong>appears that such requests are being completely ignored</strong>. I'm willing to make the good-faith assumption that each of these requests is in fact being looked at by an employee, who decided not to take action at that time.</p>

<p>Ideally, it would be great if SE opened up their internal issue tracker to the public, to see what priorities the team has assigned to every request, but I can see some issues with that (e.g. ""why is my <em>important</em> issue low priority?"").</p>

<p>I think it would be great for SE's relations with the community if they at least, for example, commented on each request that gets logged in their internal issue tracker with a comment to the effect of ""we're aware of this issue and are looking into it"". This way, it's clear to everyone that SE is listening to people on meta. This was an important point in <a href=""https://medium.com/@cellio/dear-stack-overflow-we-need-to-talk-13bf3f90204f"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Monica Cellio's Medium post</a>, which said that despite all the internal chat that surrounds an event, it makes it seem like no action is being taken:</p>

Having a GitHub repo that doesn't say ""We don't want help"", and a Question answered in summary that SE may ""Eventually, probably"" go open source in the future (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/35/will-stack-overflows-engine-be-open-sourced"">Will Stack Overflow&#39;s engine be open sourced?</a>) reasonably seems as a contradiction needing clarification. Here it is (the name is ""StackOverflow"", but the namespace in the URL is ""StackExchange"" and it is a verified account): <a href=""https://github.com/StackExchange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/StackExchange</a></p>

<p>This is the bug I want to help fix: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/258179/the-new-profile-shouldnt-mistakenly-imply-that-you-can-earn-the-informed-badge/318704#318704"">The new profile shouldn&#39;t mistakenly imply that you can earn the Informed badge on a meta site</a></p>

<p>If I then wish to answer a Javascript question, my 200k reputation means nothing with respect to the javascript experience domain. It means something regarding programming in general, adhering to SO rules, and other things too. But not to Javascript experience or knowledge, because I have never touched it. If I post an answer that is acceptable, after having researched for the solution, I am quite certain some users will glance over it first before other answers by users with less reputation but more experience in the field, simply because I have more rep. Some users will jump to using my solution simply because they think my high rep means I'm a Javascript god and know what I'm doing. In this case here my rep could be displayed fully, but under it with something like (~1000) where if you hover over that, it says <code>trusted in other domains</code>. And as my Javascript question and answers and involvement increases, the (~1000) slowly increases accordingly, and the description goes to <code>Trusted within Javascript</code>. Something like that. I really feel like the reputation system cripples this site to some extent.</p>

Since doing that and spending more time on the exchanges I've found more features that actually aren't listed in the help center even <em>IF</em> they're searched for by proper name.  So, I'd like to make a suggestion about the tour/help center, the short version I'd like to have them included in.    My suggestion would be to incorporate this into the ""Take a tour"" section:</p>

<p>Underneath the ""Unlock badges for special achievements""</p>

<p>Cut off the remained and replace it with a ""Next"" button.  The next button goes into the ""Help Center"" with a 
dialog window advising users to read  The Code of Conduct (with everything else greyed out), once that's read
the help center return and prompts the user to read ""Expected Behavior"", ""Asking"", ""Answering"", &amp; ""Reputation and Moderation"".
Just after Reputation and Moderation is read, the Privileges window pops up with a heading like "" See what earning a good reputation in the community can do for you !
  THE dialog window would end  here with a ""NEXT"" button visible.  On the next page add back in the end of /tour window   ""See new questions"", ""Ask a question"" , ""Visit the help center"",along with the banner stating  _____ Stack  Exchange is part of the Stack Exchange network.</p>

<p>The tour would end there and a new category would be added into the help center called ""Tips"" with linked sections like:</p>

<p>First, just about none of this information is readily available, I had to find this while reading different parts of the stack exchange.
Pretty much ANY coder would want to know about the API and the docs that went with it, and again, no information about the api comes up even if it's searched for in the help center.</p>

<p>The blog IS listed as a link at the bottom, but drawing more attention to it would also help newer users to learn more about the site, see what's new to the site and what the goals of the site are from the developers themselves</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>What happens when I start a bounty?</h3>
<p>The bountied question will appear with a special indicator in all question lists, and <em>it will also be <strong>visible on the homepage Featured tab for 7 days</strong></em>. Part of what you’re “paying for” with the bounty is to get additional attention for your question, over and beyond what a normal question gets. In that regard, a bounty does not guarantee a response, and reputation refunds are not available if no answers are received as a result of the bounty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that it says, &quot;visible on the homepage Featured tab for 7 days&quot; (it specifically doesn't say &quot;up to 7 days&quot;, it <strong>clearly and unconditionally</strong> says &quot;for 7 days&quot;), but that's not what happens when someone actually awards it (prematurely, before the 7 days are up), e.g., the current implementation doesn't actually fit the spec as documented.</p>
<h1>Problem:</h1>
<p>The promise gets broken the minute you make an award of the bounty (outside of the 1-day grace period <em>after</em> the 7 days of the bounty being featured in the Featured tab of the homepage).  This is a problem because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New bounty contributors don't seem to realise that lots of folks look at the Featured tab, which is sorted by expiration (oldest bounties first), to see interesting and worthwhile question/answer pairs, to learn from, and to upvote.</p>
<p>In my experience on Stack Overflow, most of the upvotes happen in the last 12 hours of the 7 days, because it is the 6 day old bounties that would show up at the top of the first page of the Featured tab from the homepage of stackoverflow.com.</p>
<p>In fact, that's a pretty easy way to earn a lot of reputation, for both the asker and the answerer; all of these facts are well known by the top active users, and are vividly written between the lines in <code>/help/bounty</code>, too (where rules against overpromotion are clearly documented), but it's not actually explicitly documented there at this time for the newer contributors, nor is it something that would come natural if you're a <em>New contributor</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For experienced bounty contributors, there's an anti-pattern on the other end, where they have to wait until the very last minute to award the bounty (e.g., during the 1-day grace period), which is short enough that it's easy enough to miss it entirely, and then at least half the bounty may go to waste.</p>
<p>I would imagine that some users may have gotten burned with awarding the bounties prematurely in the past, and may resist any sort of action, trying to get the most out of their bounty, which may possibly involve losing half of it due to inaction.  (The correct pattern would be to do an Accept Answer as soon as a good answer is available, and changing it if a better answer does come along; but it's also easy to see how having being burned on the bounties in the past, might prevent you from trusting that an Accept Answer is always to your advantage here.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Workaround:</h1>
<p>The current <em><strong>best workaround</strong></em> for both new and experienced contributors alike is to use the <em><strong>&quot;Accept Answer&quot;</strong></em> functionality to trigger guaranteed eventual bounty award in full to the accepted answer.</p>
<p>This way, one can accept the answer at any time, change their mind at any time, the full amount of bounty will always be awarded to the accepted answer after the expiration of the grace period (unless manually awarded at any other point) and the question will continue to remain on the Featured tab for the whole 7-day duration, including at the very top of the Featured tab in the final minutes of the bounty, where both the asker and answerer have the potential to receive a significant number of upvotes (which are most likely to come in the final 12 hours of the 7-day period when the bounty question bubbles up to the top of the Featured list).</p>
<p>This is a preferred approach even for experienced contributors, because it has no downsides at all.  In fact, it shows everyone that the answer does solve the problem, hence, it's much more likely for both the asker and answerer to both receive a whole bunch of free upvotes for providing obvious value to the community — compared to an abandoned question, where it's not exactly clear what's going on, so, passer-bys are less likely to upvote the question and/or answer if they have no clue what's going on, or whether all the dots were connected and addressed.</p>
<h1>Long-Term Solution:</h1>
<p>I think the proper long-term solution would be for StackExchange to implement one or more of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fix the bug where a premature award makes the question disappear from the Featured tab (this part is a bug that conflicts with documentation).</p>
<p>In fact, if the answer was so good as to warrant an immediate bounty award, then more people should see it, not less.  Making it disappear from Featured is a disservice to the community, where the whole point of the site is supposed to be to learn and see success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make it possible to unaward the bounty at any time during the promised 7 days.  It is clearly documented that bounty awards are final (so, this part is up to the spec).  Personally, I think this part is more of a workaround against the bigger issue, e.g., the prior point where a premature award hides the question and answer from getting more attention.  (Awarding a bounty by mistake to a wrong answer would be a separate issue.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a variation of the above, make the bounty award button behave the same way as the accept-answer functionality, where it can be changed at any time (within the 8 days), and doesn't make the question disappear from the Featured tab.  This is probably the ultimate solution, as it may simplify the paths and reduce the documentation overhead/burden, plus would also work in situations where the bounty is offered not by the asker of the question, but by a separate contributor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classification:</h1>
<p>I believe this is a &quot;bug&quot;, as the feature as implemented is not in line with the specs as documented.</p>

"325220","Migrating Comments to Chat Off Topic(words of warning, short)","<p>Apologies for the rough edit, but it's too much work at this point to put it back the way it was. and the original post really was too long anyway.</p>
<p>The reason for this post basically boils down to the contents of <a href=""https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/q/18814/15555"">my post on anesthesia</a>, it's corresponding <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/90934/discussion-on-question-by-kipbits-why-is-it-called-conscious-sedation"">chat migrated comments</a>, and <a href=""https://medicalsciences.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1055/15555"">an associated post in med sci meta</a>. I've been informed that the chat contents will eventually be automatically deleted once the necessary time period has elapsed, after which it will no longer be possible to read what was said. So i suppose i'll attempt to summarize the gist here:</p>
<p>To be brief, my post was about why a type of procedural anesthesia called conscious sedation has its name. Because in all likelihood the patient will be asleep or at least not remember the procedure. During the comments(later migrated to chat), i had it initially explained to me that this was because the drugs given to me were designed to interfere with my long-term memory. This seamed like magic; how is long-term memory just switched off without interfering with working memory? It was then explained to me that the drugs used give a similar effect to being fall-down/blackout drunk. Therefore, I think a more accurate and honest name for this type of sedation should be blackout drunk sedation. It's kind of besides the point though as I was supposed to have only local anesthesia, but they changed it on me last minute. It probably would have been better not to have had the surgery at all.</p>
<p>Long story short, I had surgery and things did not go to plan. I think it's important to remember that hospitals are dangerous places, and enter at your own peril. Also, scrutinize your doctor and watch out for funny lingo that doesn't mean what you think it should.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is not meant to change the functionality behind the link. What the ""flag"" link does now would be the exact same function the ""appeal"" link would perform when it supplants the ""flag"" link.</p>

<p>My motivation and reasoning for this feature request is as follows: </p>

<p>See, I've had my share of questions on the various StackExchange sites closed for being ""off-topic"", or because, ""This question already has an answer here"". In some cases I'd like to appeal to some panel of judges that rules over the StackExchange universe. I understand the ""flag"" link appears to have been designed for this purpose, but can we relabel it once a question is closed? It would be nice if it said, ""appeal"" instead. Makes more sense. </p>

<p>I think the term ""flag"" is more appropriate while a question is still open and fault hasn't yet been found with it. Then it would make sense for the fault-finder to click ""flag"". The fault-finder found fault with the question and he wants to flag it for moderators to review and maybe either initiate an edit cycle or close it down.</p>

<p>But once it's closed, the people who are more likely to express some disagreement they'd like to <em>flag</em> are usually either (a) those who wrote the question originally and are upset with how it was closed, or (b) other readers who might tend to agree with the question's original intent and disagree with the moderators who closed it. They want to <em>appeal</em> the decision to close the question.</p>

<p>So, how about we dynamically relabel the ""flag"" link and call it ""appeal"" once a question is closed?</p>

"326328","Show network reputation next to site reputation","<p>I have been around Stack Exchange for a while now and have a decent amount of reputation on some network sites (not crazy much but still a bit). But whenever I sign up for a new network site and thus start up with 101 rep, people feel the need to add a comment welcoming me to the site and often also post a link to the site or network rules.</p>

<p>For an actual new user that seems like a good policy (be nice to them, show them the rules before they do something wrong) but for an old user with a new site account this is somewhere between annoying and a waste of time. Also it is basically comment spam.</p>

<p>So I think it would be good to add network reputation to the user info card so that people reading the post know that they are dealing with an user that might be new to this site but that is experienced with Stack Exchange in general.</p>

<p>Also I think that the ""new contributor"" tag is not quite fitting for an experienced user.</p>

"326416","Please give suspended users an option to explain their side of the story on the meta site","<p>As it is written <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/293213/259412"">here</a> by <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/1438/jon-ericson"">Jon Ericson</a> (CM), the secrecy of the details of the individual suspensions is reasoned to protect the suspended users:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since suspended users are unable to tell their side of the story on meta or chat, the less said the better. Hard to think of a better way to turn a user bitter than to humiliate them when they are helpless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, as the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/293229/259412"">most upvoted answer</a> by <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/151385/mad-scientist"">Mad Scientist</a> states, there are at least two cases, where revealing the full details of a suspension should be reasonable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>the suspended user explicitly gives permission, e.g. to let the community challenge the suspension publicly</li>
  <li>the user lies about the facts of the suspension</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also seen multiple times that users came to the MSE or to other sites to talk about the events, out of the limit of power of the mods. These posts were typically quickly downvoted and deleted, but I think no one wants this. In my opinion, the place where suspensions should be publicly talked upon, is the meta site where the suspension happened, and only if these criteria above hold.</p>

<p>My suggestion is: <em>give to the suspended users a way to post a single question on the meta</em>, while they are suspended. Once.</p>

<p>If they are sure that the suspension was unfair, they would have an option to challenge it - but, the price is that if they wouldn't say true facts, they could be easily proven by the mod tools. Furthermore, this post would remain a part of their profile forever (if it got a positively scored answer, which is likely).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question's topic is <strong>only</strong> applicable to one specific site in the Stack Exchange Network. Questions on Meta Stack Exchange should relate to features or policies that commonly apply to the network or the software that drives it, within the guidelines defined in the help center.

<p>You've almost certainly been through a process to arrive at that message, but as I've just commented, I think its current incantation encourages something that is really counter productive.</p>

<p>When I asked that question, <strong>I wanted external input, fresh eyes, novel thought, different experiences to contribute a solution to a problem that we've been fighting about internally for years</strong>. I got some of that and I'm thankful for it.</p>

<p>But this close reason essentially says ""Go away. Deal with it on your own.""</p>

The check runs whenever any answer from anyone is deleted, and deleted answers that are both posted by new users and have helpful spam flags are counted twice (so that's why you see questions getting protected after just two spam answers).</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/323639/can-i-learn-what-learning-is"">This question</a> just now received three deleted answers, all of which were manually deleted by a moderator:</p>

<ul>
<li>one with helpful spam flags (I know this because I flagged it as spam and it was marked helpful upon its deletion)</li>
<li>one posted by the same author as the last one, but with no helpful spam flags</li>
<li>one posted by a different author and with <em>possible</em> helpful spam flags (the spam mask shows up, but it's possible that it was triggered due to rude/abusive flags, which don't count toward auto-protection)</li>
</ul>

<p>In all, there are three deleted answers, but as one was posted by the same user as another, it doesn't count, so those two deleted answers plus the one with helpful spam flags equals three. Yet the question wasn't protected.</p>

<p>Neither of the users ever crossed the 10 reputation threshold, so it's not as if they had enough rep at the time the question was checked. (So it's not the flaw that the check checks then-current rep rather than rep at the time the answer was posted that is causing it to not work in this case.)</p>

<p>Why wasn't the question protected? Is it because the helpful spam flag on the first answer was marked helpful automatically as a result of the answer being deleted (not by the system as spam)? If the script that marks those flags helpful runs <em>after</em> the protection check runs upon answer deletion, this explanation makes sense. Is that the case?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Tinkeringbell believes that automatic protection wasn't applied since the first answer to be posted was the non-spam one, so the second answer that had helpful spam flags was never counted, neither once or twice. However, I don't believe that that explanation is correct, since as far as I can tell based on the protection FAQ, when it runs the auto-protection check upon any answer being deleted, it does <em>not</em> consider <em>when</em> specific answers were posted; it just checks to see if it meets the criteria <em>at the time any answer from anyone is deleted</em> (hence a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/323334/why-did-community-auto-protect-this-question-when-an-answer-from-a-high-rep-user"">prior case</a> where an answer from a high-rep user resulted in auto-protection).</p>

<p>My hypothesis (that the protection check runs before the script that marks spam flags on posts deleted for other reasons as helpful) makes better sense given this piece of knowledge, but I could be wrong. I'd like to know which specific one was the case.</p>

<p>Then take a sample of an image with as many pixels as you have numbers in your matrix,</p>

<p>Then do a dot product, then add up all the terms and </p>

<p>then use the result as the new value for the pixel located in the center of your image sample.</p>

<p>Now, my question is this:</p>

<p>Does it make sense to think about an image kernel for convolution whose values actually depend on the image? For example, consider a 'sharpen' kernel:</p>

<ul>
<li>0  1  0 </li>
<li>1  4  1</li>
<li>0  1  0</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to change the value in the center to be a number between 1 and 5 depending on the brightness of the pixel which is two places to the left.</p>

<p>The reason I ask this is because I've noticed that when I look at an image, I actually look at 'neighborhoods'. not just individual pixels. While bright spots might catch my attention. I recognize parts of an image before it 'clicks'. So if I am using some parts of an image to inform me about the 'neighborhood' that part lives in, I am wondering if this sort of 'dynamic kernel' could produce a matrix that informs us more meaningfully about the image. Obviously I am naive and know very little about image processing but a lot of papers on image convolution get technical very fast and then I'm lost. I am afraid to ask this on stack overflow because there is no specific code I am asking about..</p>

<p>EDIT: The link you posted does not have any mention of the signal processing site. As the question has no specific coding it is therefore not a question for stack overflow. Whether it belongs in math, signal processing or other section is not immediately obvious to a neophyte. I appreciate the recommendation to post on signal processing.</p>

<p>It's quicker for the typist. Secondly, it ensures that someone's code doesn't fail to appear because they accidentally only indented three spaces, not four. Thirdly, with the beginning and end tags, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/code&gt;</code>, it makes the process a breeze.</p>

<ul>
<li>This question shows research effort; it is useful and clear.</li>
<li>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>But for <em>answers</em>, the buttons are much less helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li>This answer is useful.</li>
<li>This answer is not useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>This omission of criteria makes it very easy for someone to upvote or downvote an answer for subjective reasons.</p>

<p>Sometimes questions don't have a single ""right"" answer.
People might upvote a badly written answer simply because they agree with its viewpoint, or downvote a well written and reasearched answer because they disagree with its conclusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes answers can contain opinions, independent of whether the answers are correct or not.
For instance a computing question might contain a comment that it would have been so much easier if it were done on {Windows|Mac|Unix}.
People might upvote a badly written answer simply because they like the comment, or downvote a well written answer because they
 dislike the comment.</p>

<p>The ""useful"" choice makes it very easy to vote subjectively rather than on the quality of the answer.</p>

<p>My understanding is that this isn't an appropriate use of votes.  The ""down-votes"" tag description says that the votes are ""<em>the community's way of telling peers that their content can be improved</em>"".</p>

<p>I myself have voted for well answered answers that I personally disagree with.  They are useful to me because they help me to see the other side of the issue and perhaps point out other references or ideas that I hadn't seen before; i.e. I learned something from them.</p>

<p>Is there anything that can be done to make it more obvious that the votes are not to be used to indicate whether one agrees with the answer.  Or is my understanding of ""useful"" wrong?</p>

<p>Either way, the ""<em>useful</em>"" and ""<em>not useful</em>"" tool-tips don't match ""<em>the community's way of telling peers that their content can be improved</em>"", so something is wrong somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>I'd suggest that the voting mechanism for answers say something more specific than ""useful"".</strong></p>

<p>I've found that this has one major exception in chat. Users without enough reputation to chat are not allowed to have a custom username or custom avatar; their chat username is their generic ""userXXX"" username, and their avatar is the standard one given to deleted or nonexistent users. However, if they later gain enough reputation in chat but later on lose it (including via suspension), their username and avatar are displayed <strong>permanently</strong> (or as long as their current chat profile exists); they are not reverted back to the generic ones. In other words, if at <em>any</em> point a given chat profile had 20 reputation at the time it was synced, it will <strong>permanently</strong> retain avatar and username rights. Here's an <a href=""https://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/users/347474/"">example chat profile</a>.</p>

<p>Why was the decision made to implement it this way? Why not revoke their custom avatar and username privileges on chat if they later lose the reputation?

</ul>

<hr>

<p>When a question is closed as a duplicate of another question, and it remains in the system, it contributes to searches and to aiding people asking a new question who might be unaware that theirs is a duplicate.</p>

<p>For instance, here is a basic scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Original question title: <em>Harvesting fruit</em>  </li>
<li>Duplicate question title: <em>Picking apples</em> [Closed.]</li>
</ul>

<p>Both questions now contribute to checks against new-question duplication and to providing search results.</p>

<p>But if the duplicate question never received any upvotes or answers, or if everything was received negatively, then it will be marked as a duplicate <em>and deleted automatically</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Original question title: <em>Harvesting fruit</em>  </li>
<li><s>Duplicate question title: <em>Picking apples</em> [Deleted.]</s></li>
</ul>

<p>I do believe that all types of questions should be automatically deleted if they don't meet the criteria that would let them remain. However, what's unfortunate about this is that <strong>synonymous question titles are lost along with the deletion</strong>. This means that if someone else tries searching for keywords being used by the duplicate, they may also go on to post a duplicate question.</p>

<p>What I propose is that, like tag synonyms, question titles also have so-called synonyms.</p>

<p>In this way, even though the question with the title <em>Picking apples</em> has been deleted, if somebody searches for ""Picking apples"", the system finds the question with the title <em>Harvesting fruit</em>,</p>

<p>The exact mechanism as to how this would be handled presents several issues, a few of which I will immediately present.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I suspect what should occur is that upon deletion of a question marked as a duplicate, that question's title should be moved into a review queue, just as tag synonyms are put into a review queue. Not until a certain number of people have voted to allow the synonym would it become active. <br><br>This would prevent the use of very poor, too general, or otherwise inappropriate question titles becoming synonymous and being used as a check by the system.<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>It's also possible that there are simply so many questions that are marked as duplicates and then automatically deleted that such a list would quickly become overwhelming and unmanageable. If that's the case, then there should still be some way of allowing this. Perhaps a purely manual submission of question-title synonyms.<br><br>If I mark <em>Picking apples</em> as a duplicate of <em>Harvesting fruit</em>—or even if I just become aware of it in some other way—and if I have the reputation, I could go to a question-title synonym screen—in the same way as I would for tag synonyms—and manually add the suggested synonym.<br><br></p></li>
<li><p>What determines who can submit or validate question-title synonyms would follow the same principle of who can do the same with tag synonyms. So, it would be based on reputation. But it would likely also be tied to something else; however, I can't think of the specifics of that at the moment.</p></li>

<p>For each sub-site (like Stack Overflow, Cross Validated, etc.) you have a unique section where users can post questions and receive answers. Do you think it could be a good idea to add a section (like Cross Validated Research Area, or Mathematics Stack Exchange Research Area) where users can post their research and findings instead of posting questions only? That is an area where users can post answers to unsolicited questions that they ask themselves and have a relevance to subjects in the corresponding area.</p>

<p>This is already a wonderful place where to exchange ideas and knowledge. But maybe that addition could have the potential to elevate it further and transform it into a place where people release their own research, or simply share some findings by writing short unsolicited articles for a potentially interested and specialized audience.

"332559","What is the longest accepted and answered question in the SE network as of Aug 22th 2019?","<p><em>Note: this is a rewrite of a heavily down-voted question.</em></p>

<h1>What has lead me to ask this question</h1>

<p><em>(Note to moderators: I am for taking this section out because I suspect it's not of general interest but it could make the new version of the question not recognizable from the original i.e. edited to be another question, or give me downvotes for asking a question being completely useless from the first glance)</em></p>

<p>In an earlier project, I had a task to elaborate a set of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NLP</a> (natural language processing) metrics to grade the quality of text excerpts summarizing the purpose of publicly funded software components.</p>

<p>One of the simplest metrics under consideration was for example text length. There was no exact requirements for acceptable minimum or maximum length.</p>

<p>Some vendors provided just a couple of sentences, some several pages. So my metric was to compute the median and define acceptable deviation from that, then manually analyze outliers.</p>

<p>In this context, I learnt that it is very hard to write short but precise and correct summaries for concepts based on many complexity abstraction layers.</p>

<p>I thought then how to confirm this with more texts and be able to know what is a ""good"" summary and how does it relate with the text length.</p>

<p>SO/SE sites appear a perfect data corpus for this purpose, because</p>

<ul>
<li>there are lots of questions being text pieces containing (maybe not always) summaries of complex and special topics</li>
<li>the voting system provides a human-defined distribution for the text quality where a personal bias is possibly not so high for a larger number of votes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formally, as I assume there might be some quality function F=(T,V), question quality being a function of text postings T and votes V.</p>

<p>The background motivation, or hypothesis, is here that maybe well-written summaries tend to grow in their size which I searched to confirm and posted this question.</p>

<p>Here are two examples to demonstrate how context summaries, either questions, might tend to grow in their size if a researcher goes from general to special context as the knowledge base is growing.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: Biology.</strong></p>

<p>Initially I've completely made it up but then started to search in this direction and found out there is indeed ongoing scientific research in this special area. Please excuse that the example is constructed because I am not a biologist. I think the example was so bad that it has contributed a lot to the question being down-voted. So feel free to skip to the second example.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there parasites living in eggs?</li>
<li>What are metabolism characteristics of <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR0JCP-O7mAhUB-6QKHesxBMYQFjABegQIMhAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fveterinary-science.uq.edu.au%2Ffilething%2Fget%2F4271%2Fworkshop-parasites-ists29-blair-2009.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sLHgjNak7DsdFxWU0hhOs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">egg parasites</a> in warm climate versus cool climate?</li>
<li>Where do Pacific turtles lay eggs? Did they do so a decade, longer time ago?</li>
<li>How does the climate change (another scientific discussion) in the early 21th century influence <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10393-006-0032-x"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metabolism</a> of parasites?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you try to ask a coherent question involving precise explanation of all above aspects towards some new inquiry, it will take readers more time to read and comprehend. With the growing knowledge complexity, not only text writing skills of the poster might influence the comprehension, but also the required background knowledge to follow the argumentation.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2: Information technology</strong></p>

<p>In IT, for somebody who just started to learn AWS and has some background in infrastructure deployment, it can be hard even to formulate a question.</p>

<ul>
<li>Version 1: I want to deploy container on AWS. &lt;= some downvote, some ask for more details because too general</li>
<li>Version 2: I want to deploy a container on AWS and I have created an image in  ECR &lt;= critics because not clear which service they want to use</li>
<li>Version 3: I want to deploy a container on AWS, I have an image, but I do not understand the big picture, and do not know how I can approach either ECS or Fargate or EKS. I have read the docs but do not understand, also I want to automate all that, is that possible? &lt;= community asks for more input</li>
<li>Version 4: I want to deploy a container on AWS automatically, and would like to see an automation example for EC2 to see how it works &lt;= community is sceptical about why you would want to deploy ONE container and you have not specified which language</li>
<li>Version 5: I want to deploy a container on AWS automatically for learning and demonstration purposes, and would like to see an automation example for EC2 to see how it works, maybe with Python?
=> Answer: okay you can use Boto3, here is a Gist link I've googled up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, my hypothesis is that on long term we will need more time to communicate about specialized topics, and thus get slower in any sort of progress. An indicator could be text length growing over time at SE sites for same high upvotes. Maybe though it is completely random, so my assumption is wrong.</p>

<p>The missing link was then to find out the distribution of text lengths at SE. First, I've thought of question titles in a first naive approach, but then I've got feedback that there is a hard limit of 150 characters.</p>

<h1>The actual question</h1>

<p>So is there a way to find out automatically for research purposes length of question posts on SE sites which have got an accepted answer (without dealing with <a href=""https://archive.org/details/stackexchange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dump data</a>)? </p>

<p>=========</p>

<p><em>Initial version of the post</em></p>

<p><em>This question might feel like funny, but exploring an answer from time to time might reveal something important, therefore worth answering.
Namely, the knowledge is growing rapidly, and we create ever more and more terms, and work evermore inter-disciplinary.
Thus a question to be asked specifically might involve more and more terms, getting on one hand overloaded, on the other hand showing the evolution of knowledge and questions. And getting less broad of course!
An example of how I see it - imagine you study biology, turtles, their parasites and closely related phenomena.</em></p>

"332578","Is it okay to use Data Explorer as a recruiting tool?","<p>It occurred to me that the Data Explorer makes enough user information publicly available that it can be an effective recruiting tool. I.e. it is easy to get a list of users in a particular location, who use certain tags, etc. and list any information about themselves that they have made publicly available (website URL, about me, etc.).</p>

<p>However it's also possible to get a link to their StackOverflow/StackExchnage profiles via the <code>User.Id</code> field.</p>

<p>Is it okay to use the Data Explorer as a means of identifying people and then potentially contacting them (given that contacting a person will only be possible if they have made that information publicly available)?</p>

<p>NOTE</p>

<p>This is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/277369/a-terms-of-service-update-restricting-companies-that-scrape-your-profile-informa"">A Terms of Service update restricting companies that scrape your profile information without your permission</a>. The change in terms of service discussed here mentions recruiting companies that sell lists of contactable users and potentially lying regarding the origin and contents of these lists.</p>

<p>I'm asking a separate question - i.e. currently StackOverflow data is accessible to anyone with some SQL skills and understanding of the platform. I'm specifically asking about the case of providing your own HR department with a list of contactable users stipulating that these were identified via the StackOverflow platform - i.e. stipulating that 'these are a bunch of developers who are likely worth trying to recruit based on the way that the StackExchange platform functions'.</p>

<p>From a developer's perspective, it would still be annoying. </p>

<p><strong>So while SE user data is available, it currently requires some technical knowledge to use. If the same data was made more easily available to anyone non-technical users (i.e. a free online SE data explorer for example, along the lines of Tableau, and similar interfaces), the additional reach of the data could result in spam/etc. But providing an easier means of exploring data than currently exists doesn't seem like it would be outside terms of use</strong></p>

Instead of it being flagged for moving, it received a flurry of downvotes without any comments guiding me as to what I could do better.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I asked on Stack Overflow meta how can I, or where is the best place to ask this question. This also received a flurry of downvotes followed by closure, only by flagging this post was I able to get any sense from anyone about what might be going on.</p>

<p>My asking on the correct group (software engineering) had similar results, even though I checked the rules, and looked at some other posts to gauge what was appropriate.</p>

"333986","We need systematic improvements to expiration on bounties","<p>In my opinion, the bounty system could use a lot of work. Most of the time when I put a bounty on a question of mine, it goes unanswered and I lose the bounty that I placed on the question. I see no reason why this should be the case, as it just ""penalizes"" putting bounties on questions that are hard-to-answer. Ironically, these questions are typically exactly the types of questions that deserve to have big bounties (as they typically require additional rewards to draw out less common experts to answer them).</p>

<p>I think it's a shame that questions that are highly advanced usually get one or two upvotes and will never see a single answer. Answering a difficult obscure question currently have way less of a payout than more popular questions like ""why does stirring my soup make it cooler?"" And I think if someone genuinely wants to have their question answered (even if it takes months of time), there should eventually be a way of having a high enough value for answering the question that people take the effort to answer it.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions for improving the current bounty system:</p>

<p>Reputation points charged for Bounties that doesn't receive any positively-received answers are not only refunded to the user, but the question automatically receives 5 upvotes and the question goes back on the featured list but with a higher bounty</p>

<p>Reward multipliers for unanswered questions. For instance, a well-received question that hasn't been answered for 2 years and has received multiple bounties should have a HUGE payoff for answering. Every time a question goes unanswered after a bounty-session, the question should have a multiplier that rewards answering that question.</p>

<p>More ""prestige points"" are awarded in the form of medals related to placing bounties. (I think way too many ""power users"" hoard their reputation points, which could be used to highlight questions that require more expertise)
Maybe these proposed solutions are not perfect, but I think this issue should be taken seriously as I feel that this platform can have a much better system for helping</p>

"334327","Why was the CoC page changed to remove Jeff Atwood's original one?","<p>Why was the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/conduct"">Code of Conduct page</a> changed last month?</p>

<p><strong>It used to have a excellent CoC written by the SE co-founder Jeff Atwood himself</strong>, <em>and that is why I am an SE member and moderator</em>.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? If not, was there a public discussion about this (links, please.)?</p>

<p><hr>
Here is a partial excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Unacceptable Behavior</em></p>
  
  <p><em>No subtle put-downs or unfriendly language.</em> Even if you don’t intend it, this can have a negative impact on others.</p>
  
  <p><em>No name-calling or personal attacks</em>. Focus on the content, not the
  person. This includes terms that feel personal even when they're applied to content (e.g. “lazy”).</p>
  
  <p><em>No bigotry</em>. We don’t tolerate any language likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — and those are just a few examples. When in doubt, just don’t.</p>
  
  <p><em>No harassment</em>. This includes, but isn’t limited to: bullying,
  intimidation, vulgar language, direct or indirect threats, sexually
  suggestive remarks, patterns of inappropriate social contact, and sustained disruptions of discussion.</p>
  
  <p><em>Enforcement</em></p>
  
  <p>We take your reports seriously. Those who don’t follow the Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions deemed appropriate by our moderation team. This is how moderators generally handle misconduct:</p>
  
  <p><em>1. Warning</em></p>
  
  <p>For most first-time misconduct, moderators will remove offending content and send a warning. Most issues are resolved here.</p>
  
  <p><em>2. Account Suspension</em></p>
  
  <p>For repetitive misconduct or behavior containing harassment, bigotry, or abuse, moderators will impose a temporary suspension (one day or more, depending on the violation).</p>
  
  <p><em>3. Account Expulsion</em></p>
  
  <p>For very rare cases, moderators will expel people who display a pattern of harmful destructive behavior toward our community.</p>
  
  <p>All actions will be taken on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of our moderators. ...</p>
  
  <p>We created this Code of Conduct because it reinforces the respect that we, as a community, expect from one another. Having a code also provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it stray off-course.</p>

"334501","The Exact Use Of Question Upvotes And A Suggestion On Question Downvotes","<p>I was wondering why there is question upvotes. The obvious reason would be that the question is useful, clear, and has a positive impact towards the community. Also, the question asker has researched extensively towards the answer of the question.</p>

<p>But at the same time, there is no clear boundary to do nothing or to upvote the question. For example, a well written question that is extensively researched but has bad grammar might get one downvote and one upvote, as people have different ideas of what an upvote consists of. Is there a clear boundary between upvote and novote?</p>

<p>Also, upvotes are, to my understanding, based off some categories, the ones I have stated above. If a question satisfies them, it gets upvotes. But that would not be very useful because the question asker does not need a hundred people telling them that the question is good, they only need to know that it is good, many people think that, and having people tell them how it could be improved is even better.</p>

<p>So perhaps, we should make upvotes tag based and this way people will know what question is good. New tags give you points, this way simply getting views is not enough for points, but to make your question satisfy all the big signposts saying what you should do.</p>

<p>Now to the question downvotes. This is more clear: downvotes=not enough effort, bad question, dumb question, etc. The problem is, most times the people looking at the questions are more knowledgeable that the person asking them, because they went into there to answer the question. This way, something that seems simple may be complex to the people asking the question. Also, for the people who know the answer, the vocabulary doesn't matter, but for the asker, they might search up their question on Google, then get nothing back because they don't know the special vocabulary! This shouldn't get downvoted, but simply being linked to the right vocabulary and information.</p>

<p>Downvotes should probably be because the question yields many search results on Google already. They should also be tag based as well, this way, the asker would know how to make the question better and not just know that their question is bad. Also, some questions are just flawed in one part, but gain many downvotes because of the large number of views, then many people downvote for the same reason. Neither upvotes nor downvotes should be rewarding or punishing because of the number of views, but to improve the question.</p>

<p>Also, edits should now be able (they don't have to) to address downvote tags. When the asker addresses the tag someone posted, they would get a notification to check. After two days of not verifying the downvote, it is removed. This way, people would not have their questions be bad, change it to be good, and still get downvotes because no one did anything to the questions. Also, the people who downvote because of their mood would have to be responsible now to their downvotes. To avoid spam editing we should have this feature only used twice for every tag.</p>

<p>So: we should have tag based systems, and let the readers and askers of the question know: how many people upvoted or downvoted, how many different upvote or downvote tags, and what are the tags. A sum of them to get the current number would also be good.</p>

<p>(edit)
The OP is using the word ""tag"" in a different way to its usual interpretation on SE. They propose that instead of simple upvote &amp; downvote buttons that there are a series of categories (eg good grammar, clear, etc) that voters can tick to indicate how valuable a question is.</p>

"335343","What is actually being done about the SE/SO culture?","<p>Seems like pronoun clarification and proper use of them is very important to the staff of Stack Overflow at this time, based on the firing of a mod over the issue, resulting apologies, scrambling to deal with fallout, stressing of the new CoC and the specific FAQ about pronouns. And yet, SO staff don’t seem to have clarified their pronouns in the ‘About me’ sections of their profiles. Doing so would help normalize pronoun clarification clarification and set an example for real cultural change. </p>

<p>In addition, it seems like many responses to the CoC, and particularly the pronoun use aspect, have been highly negative, and yet there don’t seem to be SO staff defending the CoC.</p>

<p>Finally, beyond the CoC and some dubious machine learning stuff, it doesn’t seem like anything real is being done at SO Inc., such as hiring consultants or experts in culture and inclusivity, conducting internal training, etc. I suggest the situation with Monica Cellio was handled so badly because of a lack of training and understanding on the part of the SO staff that led to what was essentially a panic reaction.</p>

<p>So what is really being done about the culture? Has it just gotten lost in the noise and I missed it?</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"">This post</a> from more than a year ago (and referenced again recently) seems to recognize the problem but mainly calls on the users to act differently to fix it.

<p>And <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/10/iterating-on-inclusion/"">this one</a> talks about machine learning, the new CoC, and changing site interactions and other technical elements.

This abuse requires moderator intervention however users lack the tools to really ""prove"" they are being ganged up on. In other words, no one will ever truly know if this behavior is happening. As such, the ""no cop, no stop"" rule says we are actively encouraging this gang mentality.</p>

<p>I am aware of <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/390178/new-popup-message-when-voting-on-a-question-answer"">the experiment to not display negative votes</a>. But that doesn't prevent the opportunity for users to abuse the -4 score home-page deactivation scheme.</p>

<p><strong>My Proposal</strong> is simply allow new questions to simmer a bit, get some eyes on them, and after a grace period pull them off the active list.</p>

<p>I assume there is no jarring and injurious consequence to allowing a -5 score to sit on the board for a day or so. If the post is really inappropriate we have a flag system. Voting is a low-urgency privilege that gives best results under many eyes.</p>

<p>Consider the corollary: positive votes may have to wait up to 3 hours before the Twitter Bot announces them, yet the instantaneous treatment of negative scores invites abuse. I realize this discrepancy is a logistics issue, but it exists nonetheless.</p>

<p>Recent actions of Stack Exchange Inc have come under a lot of scrutiny.</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/333965/387405"">Moderators elected by the community have resigned or suspended activity in protest of recent actions</a>.</p>
<p>5 out of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions?tab=votes&amp;page=1817"">the 10 lowest scoring questions on this site</a> were posted in the past 4 months, all 5 were authored by someone with a <a href=""/questions/tagged/stack-exchange-team"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stack-exchange-team&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stack-exchange-team</a> flair next to their name.</p>
<p>The users Stack Exchange aims to protect <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/335713/387405"">have reported</a> a <em>&quot;lashing out at members of the LGBTQ+ community&quot;</em>. The <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/334605/387405"">top response</a> to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/334551/387405"">the <em>apology</em></a> send out by Stack Exchange Inc. calls it <em>&quot;meaningless&quot;</em> for refusing to come clean with respect to one of the aforementioned actions.</p>
<h2>$$$ &gt; community?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/335646/387405"">the new chief executive officer of Stack Overflow promotes the company to investors</a> by citing revenue projections:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>practically ubiquitous — and lucrative, with the company claiming an annualized revenue run rate of $80 million, a measure of how much revenue it projects to generate in the next 12 months if current conditions hold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the advertisement mentions variations on the word <strong>business</strong> 9 times, featuring the word <strong>community</strong> only 6 times. I get it, you need to <a href=""https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/51667-48"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">satisfy investors</a> but as noted in the Business Insider article, you can't do it without the community and it'd be a shame to see these communities (because Stack Exchange is more than just Stack Overflow) break apart over mismanagement by a few executives.</p>
<h2>Systemic procrastination</h2>
<p>Now, this may seem like harsh criticism to those passing by, surely the Stack Exchange team is doing the best it can? I can't really answer that but I do know they often like to take their sweet time.</p>
<p>For example the latest theme update on the English Language Stack Exchange, <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic"">the fourth largest site by traffic in the Stack Exchange network</a>, was <a href=""https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11693/71848"">rather poorly received</a> (the <a href=""https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions?tab=votes&amp;page=66"">second most downvoted question in ELU Meta history</a>). Users are <a href=""https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11888/71848"">still not satisfied with the results</a>, but alas, the Stack Exchange team has moved on to new adventures.</p>
<p>As <a href=""https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11888/we-tried-to-fix-it#comment51599_11888"">one user put it in February</a>, almost three months after <a href=""https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11888/71848"">users expressed their dismay</a> at the lack of action from the Stack Exchange team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you've mistaken the request for input as an actual request for input instead of what it really was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know this is just one example and I'm sure there are many.</p>
<h2>Oversight &amp; scrutiny, the key to sustainable progress?</h2>
<p>All this leads me to think there should be a mechanism for keeping employees, the executive if you will, to account. Site-specific Metas are a great place for voicing issues affecting a specific site but they're ignored easily by the executive.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what such a mechanism should look like or if it already exists, but I think it's a real shame to put off veteran contributors over something as minute as site design (or some other matter unrelated to the goal of sharing expert knowledge). It just seems that if the Stack Exchange team works for the benefit of the community then the community should have some checks and controls.</p>
<p>To make it a bit more political without making it too partisan political, let me end on this quote from <a href=""https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1136&amp;context=soss_research"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Parliamentary Oversight for Government Accountability</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet parliaments
must have not only the tools but also the political will to oversee the government. Only then
can they move from formal to liberal democracy because liberal democracy requires effective
oversight implementation and not just oversight potential. The major challenge for the
international organizations concerned with the promotion and consolidation of democracy is
to identify and promote the conditions under which parliaments and parliamentarians are
more likely to engage in effective oversight of government activities.</p>

<p>Those rules are very nice and, as someone on the autism spectrum with anxiety issues, I'm really happy that they are here. However, I have heard numerous times that, regarding comments, &quot;meta is different&quot; (eg: more lenient).</p>
<p>This &quot;more lenient&quot; is a bit hard to quantify for me, which lead me to this question:</p>
<p>If someone posts a comment (under an answer of mine) basically saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree with your answer, here is why...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it okay for me to flag it as &quot;no longer needed&quot; (&quot;NLN&quot;) and ask other people to do so (so that the comment will disappear)?</p>
<p>I feel like, if you disagree with me, you should use your votes and write your own answer. Furthermore, those kinds of comments tend to bring heated discussion who can turn badly <em>very</em> quickly (which isn't good for anyone).</p>
<p>So, to my eyes, if a comment just says &quot;I disagree/you are wrong&quot;, it's better to remove the comment (as &quot;no longer needed&quot;), than wait for a debate to start and not nice words to fuss, leading to a flood of rude/abusive comments.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, if you feel like an answer is full of outright lies, I understand your urge to point it out (to warn other people). However, as I said (and in my opinion), a debate won't lead to anything. That's why, instead of saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is completely false!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I urge you to <em>ask</em> instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes you think that? Do you have a source?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very relevant link explains it better than I do over here: <a href=""https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2147/21067"">Why were comments pointing out potential bad advice in an answer deleted?</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>So, again, if a comment is basically saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree/this is wrong/etc...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it fine for me to flag as &quot;NLN&quot; and ask other people (for example, on meta chat) to take a look and flag it too if they think I'm right?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For people thinking that this is not good because it will bloc people for having contradicting views, this isn't what it is. You will still be able to disagree with something and you will be able to make it known in <em>another</em> answer (instead of a thread of comment leading mostly nowhere). (Just don't target <em>the user</em>, please. Target the <em>bad advises</em> instead).</p>

The article is called &quot;Employing Interns&quot; and is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The article discusses pragmatic reasons for employing interns, practical considerations with employing interns and compliance with U.S. law concerning internships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Conclusions section of the article states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employers with unpaid internship programs should develop standard disclosure forms to be signed by prospective interns acknowledging, among other things, that no job is being offered in connection with the successful or unsuccessful completion of the internship. The internship should have specific start and stop dates. In addition, the employer should obtain the intern's signature on a document stating the intern understands that he or she is participating in a valid internship and therefore will not be entitled to wages (or only to minimum wages) for the time spent in the internship. On this matter, the employer should probably consult with legal counsel, and legal counsel will probably want the document to include much more detail. The greater the number of interns involved, the greater the risk if the details are overlooked.</p>
<p>Misclassification of interns as trainees rather than employees could result in the interns being deemed employees eligible for Social Security withholding and matching, unemployment insurance benefits and workers' compensation. The tax ramifications for an organization having &quot;employees&quot; for whom FICA taxes have not been withheld and paid can be substantial, including a 100 percent penalty for FICA withholding not actually paid by the employer.</p>
<p>For large-scale and ongoing internship programs in which the employer wants to pay less than the applicable minimum wage or overtime, legal counsel should be consulted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to know whether Stack Exchange has developed, and whether it's in the habit of getting signatures on, a &quot;standard disclosure form&quot; for its new moderators.  If so, what does it say, and approximately when was it instituted?</p>
<p>Is &quot;unpaid internship&quot; a reasonable approximate description of the role of a volunteer moderator?</p>

<p>Someone went through and chose the hats for this year. Even if the hats are all reused they are not just a copy from last year, the &quot;This Is Fine&quot; hat was last seen in 2017.</p>
<p>Knowing that, I can not fathom how SE felt it was ok to run a hat that says &quot;This Is Fine.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel &quot;This Is <strong>Not</strong> Fine&quot; and this hat, under the current circumstances is inappropriate.</p>
<p>There is no hiding the fact that the community is very much upset. We are not Fine. The situation with Monica is not Fine. Our relationship with you SE is not Fine. The name for this hat is not Fine.</p>

"340143","Place a bounty to reward an answer on a duplicate (closed) question","<p>Proposal: Allow bounties on questions that are marked as duplicate, which may have valuable answers.</p>

<p>(or make duplicate questions not having the status 'on hold')</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>

<p>It regularly happens that a closed question has a really good answer. This particularly occurs with questions that are marked as duplicate (questions without intrinsic problems and that may have received good answers before being closed).</p>

<p>Therefore it might occur that a person wishes to place a bounty on the question to reward an existing answer or bring attention to it. However this is not possible under the current system. A duplicate question is a closed question. </p>

<p>This closed status has the undesirable side-effect that the answers given to that question are treated as second class content which can not receive bounties (but also the site does not direct to them, closed questions refer to the parent duplicate question but the other way around does not occur, there is a 'linked' and 'related' list but they are much less visible and in some interfaces, like phone, they do not appear).</p>

<p>Of course one might argue that questions can be merged (or get rid of the on hold status, or repost the answer on the duplicate). But merging would destroy the duplicate (and duplicates are also considered useful). In addition, duplicate questions may be different enough that you can not merge them, or at least it involves a lot of noisy bureaucracy and discussion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Practical example case, sketch of situation:</strong></p>

<p>I have searched for duplicate questions with bounties (<a href=""https://data.stackexchange.com/stats/query/1165906/duplicate-questions-where-answers-have-bounties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">query</a>). I found not so many but it did actually show up an answer of my own. <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/236863/why-under-joint-least-squares-direction-is-it-possible-for-some-coefficients-to"">Why under joint least squares direction is it possible for some coefficients to decrease in LARS regression? [duplicate]</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that this is a good example case where the closed question is still valuable and maybe shouldn't be closed for that reason (yet the 'duplicate link' is still useful). Also, the answer would not be suitable under the duplicate question and merging is not appropriate. The question is duplicate but asked in a very different way and with a different viewpoint angle in mind.</p>

There is an additional document that has not gotten nearly as much attention - the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public"">""Public Network Terms of Service""</a>. Why is it necessary for us to have two different documents that define what is and what is not acceptable on the network?</p>

<p>The obvious answer is that the Terms of Service is intended for lawyers and the Code of Conduct for ordinary people, but the recent unpleasantness seems to have taught us:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Code of Conduct itself has legal relevance.</li>
<li>Resolving things with openness, communication, and good faith is better than lawsuits.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, I'm not proposing any <em>substantive</em> changes in the rules, such as allowing something that's currently disallowed, disallowing something that's currently allowed, or changing current procedures, privileges, obligations, or penalties. What I'm proposing is that they all be defined in a single location, one that would preferably be expressed in clearer language rather than dense legalese.</p>

<p>For example, instead of this dense paragraph (from the Terms of Service):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to access or use the Network or Services, including without limitation to complete a Stack Overflow account registration. By accessing or using the Services or the Network in any manner, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, access or use the Services or Network in any manner, and may not provide any personal information to or on the Services or Network (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could phrase it in a ""Code of Conduct"" way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our network is only for those 13 and over. If you are under 13, don't participate here or provide any personal data. If you do, we may ban you and delete any data you provided.</p>

  <li>A straightedge can be made by shaving down 3 pieces of wood with stones, and comparing them with each other for flatness.</li>
  <li>A moderately accurate protractor can be derived from the compass and straightedge.</li>

  <li>Timekeeping by the hour through the night can be established with a large dripping water clock.</li>
  <li>Over many years, one could eventually work up to constructing a mechanical clock using a pendulum and weight, and eventually

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that SE is going to survive this, unfortunately. The general
  user base has no idea what's going on, nor do I think that they would
  care. Most of the new content is homework help, or duplicates. People
  just trying to get a specific job done. SO will continue to serve
  these people just fine. They just want to remove all semblance of
  community, so they can get to strictly managing content, and not
  necessarily interaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stack Exchange has made several, very questionable decisions over the past couple of years. We can argue back and forth about their different qualities, but as a business, they are free to make those decisions. Might I remind you, as well, that it is people making these decisions.</p>

<p>All too often do we suspect ill intent, without considering the entire picture. A business' very purpose for existing is to make money, unless you're Elon Musk. It is going to be more profitable for Stack Exchange to migrate from a community based model, to one which serves monetization and advertisements.</p>

<p>Can you actually blame a company for desiring to make more money? Especially when beholden to investors?</p>

<p>I get it, I do. This behavior feels very slimy, as they work to displace communities with profit, but this is the purpose of a business.</p>

<p>And hey, you know what? Discord is amazing, among other alternative platforms. It's different, I give you that. Stack Exchange currently has a unique way to deliver content and interaction. We're going to have to get used to change, because it's here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is a suggestion which <em>has nothing to do with hats</em>.  Stack Exchange as a whole is now part of an <strong><em>interactive story</em></strong> (see below): comply to Sparky's demands, or earth is destroyed.</p>

<p>Sparky comes along each winter (say) with specific demands [replacing hat triggers], and will destroy earth if they are not met. Users of Stack Exchange need to <em>work together</em> (not individually, like for hats) to save earth.  If Sparky leaves without destroying earth, Stack Exchange (as a whole) wins.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can the community satisfy Sparky's demands before the earth is destroyed?</p>

<p>It's indented for <em>fun</em> and to foster a team spirit (think: ""yay! we joined forces and defeated Sparky!"").

<h3>𝘞𝘩𝘰 𝘪𝘴 𝘚𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘺? (non-story version)</h3>

<p>For those who don't like stories...  Sparky is a fictional entity who makes sporadic unorthodox ""demands"" (i.e., sets peculiar challenges for the community).  The one I thought up is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Ask three questions by <em>three different users</em> on <em>three different sites</em>.</li>
  <li><p>The title needs to contain the word ""hippopotamus"".</p></li>
  <li><p>Each needs to reach the <em>Hot Network Questions</em> list.</p></li>
  <li><p>This has to be done in <em>January 2020</em>.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The demands will change as the story progresses.  Basically, we do what Sparky says and ""we win"" (for now), and the interactive story continues.  Otherwise ""we lose"" (perhaps Sparky destroys earth).</p>

<p>It's intended to become part of an ongoing interactive story, with other quirky challenges.  The community is part of the story.</p>

<p>(<em>Relevant search</em>: <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/search?q=hippopotamus%20is%3Aquestion%20created%3A01-2020""><code>hippopotamus is:question created:01-2020</code></a>.)</p>

<h2>𝕎𝕙𝕠 𝕚𝕤 𝕊𝕡𝕒𝕣𝕜𝕪?  (story version)</h2>

<p><strong><em>Captain!</em></strong>  We've received a message from a ""being"" (for lack of a better word); we've been calling it <strong><em>Sparky</em></strong>.  We believe we captured an image of Sparky below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Pmfzw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Pmfzw.jpg"" alt=""Sparky appears as a yellow/orange squiggle with a purple outline; Sparky has eyes, a mouth, and some long wavy strands of hair; Sparky appears emotionless; Sparky&#39;s background contains multiple blue spots.""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sparky's language is unlike that on earth (it sounds something like dolphins communicating), but <strong><em>we believe we have translated a threatening message</em></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Greetings Farthlings!</p>
  
  <p>[muffled sounds] ... I need to flick the switch on the side?  ...  Is it not recording?  ...  [redacted]  ...</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Greetings Farthlings!!</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>[approx. 30 seconds pass]</p>
  
  <p>I greet you with awkward silence, as is customary in our culture.  Please do so in kind.</p>
  
  <p>I am informed you will perceive me as a kind of squiggle.  Understand, I come from a <em>universe</em> which <em>intersects</em> yours.  I too am from Farth, but in my <em>dimension</em>.  Understand, <strong><em>I am mighty!!</em></strong>  <em>Do not call me unbefitting nicknames like ""zip"" or ""ziggy""</em>.  I shall be properly addressed as <em>Admiral Flippy Floppy</em> [<em>ed</em>: our best translation].</p>
  
  <p>I find your planet quirky.  I enjoy watching you squirm like how you enjoy watching ""reality TV"".</p>
  
  <p>Of all that your species has ""achieved"" [muffled snickering], I'm fond of the word ""hippopotamus"".  I thus assign you a task:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>To save Farth (for now)...</strong> get the word ""hippopotamus"" thrice to the <em>Hot Network Questions</em> page.  More specifically:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><p>Ask three questions by <em>three different users</em> on <em>three different sites</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p>The title needs to contain the word ""hippopotamus"".</p></li>
    <li><p>Each needs to reach the <em>Hot Network Questions</em> list.</p></li>
    <li><p>This has to be done in <em>January 2020</em>.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Do this or I'll... umm... oh, there's so many ways I could destroy Farth, how do I decide?  Okay, I'll raise temperatures on your planet by 2 degrees.  [muffled sounds]  What do you mean they're already doing that themselves?  Wow, these humans are [unintelligible].  <strong><em>Do this or I'll push Farth into the Sun!</em></strong>  [<em>ed</em>: at this point, Sparky played a sound effect]  How's that?  Okay, good.  I'll be back at the end of January to destroy Farth, or not.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>[approx. 30 seconds pass]</p>
  
  <p><em>Admiral Flippy Floppy</em> out.</p>

<p>Captain, we don't really know if Sparky can destroy earth.  We have not seen any being like this before.  Maybe we should do what Sparky says, just in case.</p>

Therefore, I suggest that if a low reputation user (let us say, an user whose reputation is below 100) accepts an answer less than a minute after having accepted another answer to the same question, then that user should get a warning like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be aware of the fact that no question can have more than one accepted answer.

<ul>
<li>What's ""basic"" for someone depends on the expertise the person has in a given topic</li>
<li>What's ""basic"" also changes with time due to the development of mankind themselves</li>
<li>If there is a big gap between a person reading or writing the question, the question will be perceived as either too complex or too basic (not useful) by the reader</li>
<li>Both of which have the tendency to have the reader instantly press the downvote button</li>
<li>The average level of expertise in each area (including in how to use SE in the first place) will rise due to the tendency that veterans stay on the site for years and years to come</li>
<li>This means that the likelihood that a newcomer receives offensive feedback (this includes downvotes on a newcomer's first question) for a question they ask rises with the age of SE (I bet SE has data which shows a decline in adoption rate, a rise in complaints of newcomers about the offensiveness of the site and a rise in downvotes received on first questions submitted by newcomers)</li>
<li>This means furthermore that basic questions a newcomer has are nearly impossible to easily find, because the search engine devalues questions by other newcomers asked before which got downvoted or negatively moderated</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually the common opinion I read in Meta that newcomers more and more ask ""stupid"" or ""spam"" questions supports all of those claims.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Maybe the effect downvotes have on ""basic"" questions could be reduced.
For example, the search engine could ignore downvotes on newcomer questions if newcomers search for that particular question, or a similar one. But I feel like this is a very bad idea. Because how could the search engine possibly know if something is a ""basic"" question or not? This would reduce the perceived quality of answers found by newcomers which might be worse than some initial understanding issues.</p>

<p>Actually I think the root cause is how the voting functionality is used. The overlying intent (beneath some others) of the voting buttons is that the search engine can decide which question/answer is useful and which is not. This allows the search engine to provide the most relevant questions/answers to someone who is searching. So the community is encouraged to upvote useful questions/answers and downvote useless ones. But now my question becomes, how should someone know if a question/answer is useful? It <em>certainly</em> is for the person writing the text, otherwise they wouldn't have wasted their time.</p>

"346487","Should the community decide which questions become hot?","<p>Since I have been elected a moderator at <a href=""https://ai.stackexchange.com/"">Artificial Intelligence SE</a> (about 1 month ago), I've noticed that certain questions that have high value (for our site, but not only), such as <a href=""https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/18701/2444"">What are the AI technologies currently used to fight the coronavirus pandemic?</a>, have not become hot questions, while others, which aren't as socially relevant (or relevant to the goal of our community) as the former, such as <a href=""https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/18587/2444"">this one</a>, have become hot questions. In the past, I've seen this pattern multiple times, not only on AI SE. For example, I've seen this on Stack Overflow, even recently, although I can't remember the exact title of the post, the post became hot because there were two successive statements (of the form <code>k++;</code> and <code>k--;</code>) that canceled each other. Of course, this was just a mistake of the writer of the code (i.e. those statements don't have any effect!!). Is this really a question that deserves to become hot?</p>

<p>This clearly suggests that the current algorithm or heuristic to determine which questions should become hot (or not) isn't working appropriately. Although I am aware of the ability that moderators have to remove a question from the hot questions list, I think this is not sufficient, in the sense that, in the case certain questions are not even considered for the hot list, they should be manually added. Furthermore, note that changing the hardcoded heuristic/algorithm doesn't improve much the situation, because, often, e.g. in the case of this coronavirus situation, the heuristic needs to change flexibly and adaptively, according to the situation, and, currently, only humans can do this (intelligently). </p>

<p>Therefore, I suggest the following alternative approach. There should be a separate voting system (possibly different than the current voting system, which mainly grades the quality of the question only according to the users that have seen and read the question or are specifically interested in that topic) that can be used to explicitly vote or promote a question to become a hot question. More precisely, I suggest that mainly moderators (and maybe other users) could vote for a question to become hot. </p>

<p>This can be especially useful for questions that don't receive answers, although they are clearly important. Furthermore, by doing this manually for several years, we could collect ""good data"" that could be used in the future to train a machine learning model to help to recognize actually potentially hot questions. Finally, I think that the community should decide which questions should become hot. A healthy community should be able to decide which questions actually deserve more attention.</p>

<p>You could argue that this new voting system is exactly similar to the existing voting system. Well, I don't see a big problem here anyway. Votes really represent the importance of the question, but, in this case, they will specifically represent something else (e.g. ""Should this question attract more attention?""). In any case, I believe this will help to promote certain questions that should really be promoted to the hot list that are not currently being promoted. </p>

<p>This voting system would be more similar (in scope) to the voting system used to close or re-open a question rather than to upvote/downvote it.</p>

<p>Some people claim that this system may not scale for sites with many questions (e.g. Stack Overflow), but this is a poor argument because people already use voting systems to close questions for other types of reasons (e.g. off-topic, too broad, etc.). Furthermore, I am not saying that this voting system needs to necessarily replace the existing system. Maybe it can simply augment it. This would be an option that moderators (or other users) would further have to deal with certain relevant questions that the underlying heuristic didn't even consider (for whatever reason, but probably because it wasn't intelligent and adaptive enough to understand it). </p>

"346896","Does/could/should SE prompt users harder to vote on and accept answers to their questions?","<p>If I remember rightly, when I view a question to which I haven't yet accepted an answer, I sometimes see a reminder to accept an answer.</p>

<p>But I was wondering if SE sites could push users harder to return to questions that remain without unaccepted answers? Perhaps in the top-right another icon a bit like mod/edit queue. Perhaps when you post a question or accept an answer you could be prompted ""what about these other questions you asked"".</p>

<p>As a user on many SE sites, but some of them infrequently, and almost exclusively to ask questions, such a feature working across all SE sites would be kind of neat. e.g. I return to SuperUser site every 2 months with a question and remember to check my old questions rarely, but I am on SO several times a week so if SO prompted me about SU questions it might help.</p>

"346970","Avoiding misuse of SE/SO for online university tests during COVID-19","<p>A number of science and technology-related sites have traditionally considered homework off-topic. As far as I understand, this is because we aim to create a base of answers which are useful for multiple people, rather than just the person asking. There are also concerns about how answers to these questions could potentially help students cheat on tests. In the light of the increase in online tests due to COVID-19, Phys.SE recently had a long discussion and it became clear that several members of the community feel strongly about the need to do something: <a href=""https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12836/"">Strict(er) adherence to homework guidelines?</a> (a score of 20 on that meta places it among the most well-received posts; it was tagged &quot;featured&quot; by a moderator).</p>
<p>Now, with most universities administering online examinations due to the public health concerns, there is a higher likelihood that students will attempt to misuse SE sites, and the fact remains that even though their homework and test questions are off-topic, they are frequently answered (before being closed) by users who are less familiar with the policies. Furthermore, people are always welcome to post comments even after closure of questions. Comments aren't supposed to be answers or hints, but in practical application, they often do answer the question, and fixing that problem is, again, a broader issue which requires a more carefully developed solution, which will take a long time.</p>
<p>The problem of people answering off-topic questions is also one which needs to be solved as a more general concern; the new close experience is working towards that goal. But that's a long-term plan, and I hope we can <strong>quickly</strong> temporarily implement a patch of sorts specifically targeted at solving this problem, just for the next few months while online learning progresses.</p>
<p>As part of the recently-shipped new user &quot;Ask Question modal&quot; experience, users can be shown basic guidelines of what's off-topic, so that's a potential place to warn users. But from experience, I can be sure that a student desperate for an answer to their test question will not bother reading anything on that page. It's just psychology: if they're the kind who'll cheat on a test, they wouldn't care the least about website rules. Humans in that mood instinctively dismiss all banners, warnings, and notifications with the smallest number of clicks and keystrokes possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's no easy solution. Here is the best I came up with: before a user (regardless of rep) starts typing a question (on any site that thinks it's vulnerable to misuse as a homework-cheating service and opts-in for this process), they must be shown a banner with words like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the increase in online instruction at schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enacted stricter policies on homework problems asked on Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow. Please type the following statement into the textbox below to continue and ask your question:</p>
<p>&quot;I assert that the question I am asking does not attempt to violate the trust of any online testing service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no need to block users from copy-pasting the prompt text into the textbox. There's no need to make this lawyer-proof, since it's not supposed to be a binding declaration or anything. The emphasis should be that the typed declaration must be as short as possible. It's just for the purpose of ensuring that they know homework is strictly not to be asked. I think that it's fine if they skim over the prompt text, since they will need to at least read a little bit of it and get the gist of it and properly complete the task of filling that textbox. At least most of them will get the impression that they have no hope of getting the question answered here. Remember that they're on tight schedules so they won't waste their time on long-shots like fussy websites. Furthermore, this declaration will be absolutely harmless for people who don't wish to ask something related to a test.</p>
<hr />
<p>This isn't supposed to be just a feature request, since I'm welcoming other ideas of how we can <strong>immediately</strong> take action to ensure that SE/SO does not help students cheat on tests. If you feel we can/should do nothing about this problem, you're welcome to go ahead and write an answer to defend your view! If you have alternate systems to achieve this goal, please chime in with answers. It's important that we resolve this as soon as possible.</p>

"347936","About canned comments","<p>Canned comments may not be as useful as we have thought.</p>
<h1>Why people post canned comments</h1>
<ol>
<li>If the author of the problematic post is of malicious intentions, posting a canned comment is effortless, hence does not matter if the comment is not read.</li>
<li>If the post is a mistake of the author or because the author is new and hence not familiar with the site, a comment appears to be more welcoming and friendly.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Why this won't work</h1>
<ol>
<li>In this case, the comment will not be read anyway.</li>
<li>In this case, a canned comment does not generally make a user feel terribly welcomed. It is cold and may do more harm than good.</li>
</ol>
<h1>So what?</h1>
<p>I suggest that we reduce our use of canned comments, and either leave no comment at all, or write an actual and welcoming comment, instead of a machine generated, cold and lifeless one.</p>
<h1>But I don't want to spend time and still want to be friendly!</h1>
<p>Then leave no comment. A canned one would not fulfill this goal, and generally makes one appear to be <em>less</em> friendly.</p>
<h1>But why?</h1>
<p>Leaving a canned comment indicates that you have read the post, yet won't bother writing an actual comment. This doesn't really sound terribly better than being neutral (leave no comment and hence no indication), right?</p>

"348798","A system to undelete useful comments?","<p>Sometimes a good question is deleted because a few people think it adds no value. Sometimes a good answer is deleted because a few people think it is not fit according to them. But there's the option for a mod-flag or an undelete-vote in these cases, most often used after editing the post into good shape.</p>

<p>Sometimes a highly voted comment is deleted because a few people think it should have been an answer. Sometimes a conversational comment is deleted because a few people think it is purely conversational. Sometimes some other comments are deleted because a few people think it should be deleted at any cost.
But there's no flag or an undelete-vote in these cases, and neither the option to edit the comment to let the useful parts stay.</p>

<p>I know that there's no notification upon the deletion of a comment for <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/255141/10251345"">reasons like this</a>. But the ""big deal"" is that some deleted comments do add value to the post either directly or indirectly which a few people might fail to notice. I am also not repeating the comments under that post because it might encourage a fraction of people who disagree with this post to go there and flag those comments that disagree with their perspective (similar incident had happened with me in the past and the ""contact us"" button handled the situation appropriately). I wonder how many comments have been deleted so far that has had an unnoticed negative impact in this network, and the people behind it never got a second chance to look into it. I would really appreciate a notification upon the deletion of my comments because it will either help me to improve my behavior on the site or I could appeal against the deletion to let useful content stay as long as it is useful.</p>

<p>If enough flags can delete a comment then shouldn't enough flags be able to undelete a comment (maybe after editing, if an apt system was available)? Sometimes, even a single person with comment-deletion privilege could delete it without notice. It may not always be the case that the removal of a comment is justified, so there should be some way to undelete comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/368426/10251345"">Appealing on meta</a> might work, but what's so handy when the commentators never know their comment was deleted in the first place? ""Contact Us"" might work, but is it guaranteed to be democratic and feasible?</p>

<p>Most comments are added for a good reason. If enough flags counter the ""good reason"", let the poster be notified and rectify themselves apart from deleting it straightaway. And if those ""enough flags"" could be countered by other flags for a good cause, which I'm requesting here, what stops it from doing so?</p>

<p>This is a feature request of a system, open for discussion, for all commentators to have a way to know and restore useful comments that could have been / can be deleted in error. There is nothing wrong with making mistakes, but one should always make new ones.</p>

"349845","isn't ""Hot Network Questions"" a bad naming (right panel of stack overflow)?","<p>For some years, I saw 'Hot Network Questions' on the right panel of Stack Overflow, and I was wondering: why does Stack Overflow suggest network questions to me? (computer network)</p>
<p>Today I noticed the questions below it, which were not computer network questions.</p>
<p>So isn't it a misleading phrase? Isn't &quot;Hot Stack-Exchange Questions&quot; a better phrase?</p>

"350078","Language detection for posts","<p>Most sites in the network have a specific set of languages that you are allowed to use in posts. For example, on Stack Overflow and most other sites, all posts must be in English. On German, all posts must be in English or German. This applies to most of the other language sites as well, e.g. on Italian, all posts must be in English or Italian. There are a couple of sites that allow other languages, e.g. Judaism which allows Hebrew, I believe.</p>
<p>For Stack Overflow, specifically, there are also language-specific &quot;sister&quot; sites, for example in Portuguese and Russian.</p>
<p>In general, the sets of languages supported on a site are small and well-defined.</p>
<p>I propose to detect posts whose majority of user-authored natural language content is not in one of the site's allowed languages and display a warning message to the poster when they submit the finished post. If there are language-specific sister sites, and the detected language of the post matches one of the languages of the sister sites, the message should additionally inform the poster about the possibility to ask their question there.</p>
<p>Something like (on Stack Overflow):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like you are trying to ask a question in Portuguese. Please note that Stack Overflow is English-only. However, you can ask questions in Portuguese on our sister site Stack Overflow em Português.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a part of site curation that could be somewhat automated and thus lessen the burden on the community, the reviewers, and the moderators. It could also improve the experience for the poster, because it will take less time (immediate automated response instead of minutes or hours for the community) to give better feedback (a constructive message instead of downvotes, closure, and deletion).</p>
<p>In particular, the recommended practice of dealing with such questions (close as &quot;Unclear&quot;, delete) is technically correct from the site point of view, but may be confusing to the poster, since it is well possible that the question is perfectly clear in their native language.</p>
<p>Non-English questions are a somewhat regular occurrence on Stack Overflow, and they mostly seem to be asked in languages for which a dedicated sister site exists, so they look more like honest mistakes. A feature like this could help those honest askers who simply confused the two sites as well, not just the moderators and the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Which content should be included in the analysis?</em> Only natural language content authored by the poster. This excludes, for example, code, LaTeX, circuit diagrams, and block quotes as well as URIs. (Questions with code where all identifiers and comments are in a different language and it is thus hard to understand what the code is supposed to do, also exist, but handling those automatically would be too complex.)</li>
<li><em>When should the message be shown?</em> At the very end of the composition process, when the poster submits the post. (For questions, this would mean the &quot;Review&quot; or &quot;Ask&quot; button, for answers the &quot;Answer&quot; button. <em>IFF</em> we want to include comments, it would be the &quot;Add Comment&quot; button or the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.)</li>
<li><em>What about false positives?</em> We should take certain measures to avoid false positives, such as making sure that enough content of the question is actually user-authored natural language content, and not e.g. mostly code. We should also ensure that both the total amount of content as well as each individual block is long enough to give the analyzer a chance to detect the language.</li>
<li><em>What percentage of false positives is acceptable?</em> Ultimately, that is a community decision. In my experience, given a long enough input (see above), language recognizers are fairly accurate these days.</li>
<li><em>Why a warning message and not automatically rejecting / placing in a review queue / migrating?</em> Because false positives.</li>

<p>So, I googled about telepathy and saw some video like <a href=""http://You%20read%20my%20mind:%20scientists%20claim%20%27first%20telepathy%20success%27%20%7C%20Channel%204%20News"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, that science is doing this by <strong>reading EEG signals</strong> and sending to other sensor as <strong>visual signal</strong> or <strong>audio signal</strong>; so if that telepathy and syncing the persons to other is real maybe they have some system behind this ability.

<p>So I tried to read about the <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=20&amp;q=jugglery%20telepathy%20psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1,5&amp;as_ylo=2016"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>jugglery telepathy psychology</strong></a> term in Google Scholar to find some paper to read the scientific hypothesis behind that, but did not find anything (maybe because I don't know the proper tags, or not spending more time on search).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can we sort tags by the average reputation of the user who added the tag?</p>
<p>Importantly, we count <em><strong>the reputation of the user who adds the tag</strong></em> (who might not be the OP).</p>
<p>To clarify, if some tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/x"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;x&#39;"" rel=""tag"">x</a> is used, say, four times, with the users' reputation <code>1</code>, <code>402</code>, <code>402</code>, and <code>1211</code> then it's average is <code>(1+402+402+1211)/4</code>.  And we create a list sorting tags by this average.  (For practicality, I suggest using the current user reputation.)</p>
<p>I'm envisaging adding a button to the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags"">tags page</a> thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<img src=""https://i.postimg.cc/02wm7Cpp/Screenshot-from-2020-07-22-12-20-10.png"">
</blockquote>
<p>I feel this would help manage tags: if high-rep users are using a tag, there's almost certainly a good reason for it.  If <em>only</em> low-rep users are using a tag, it probably needs maintenance.</p>
<p>It's a quick way to identify potentially useful tags e.g. when writing questions (when you don't have time to carefully scrutinize each tag).  It's also a useful way to identify potentially useless tags (misuse-bait) when managing tags: it's an objective metric.</p>

My concern is that does adversely affect vote tallys on <em>some</em> specific answers.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the most recent example, an answer to my own Linux networking question stated several things that I know to be correct <em>(or so I thought)</em>.  I'm relatively experienced with Linux and the answer tied together things I already knew.  It gave a good direction for further reading and research.  Ultimately reading that answer did lead me to discover the right answer.  I gave it an upvote and began my further reading.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong>: it helped me find the right answer by being <strong>entirely wrong</strong>!  It led me to discover the entire configuration system (NSS) didn't exist in the particular Linux I was using.  And yes I did state which Linux distribution I was using in the question.</p>
<p>The answer was wrong.</p>
<p>A more knowledgeable person could have known it was wrong from my question, this isn't about guesswork.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is by no-means common.  I have cast 400 votes on that site and this is only the second occasion I have really wanted to reverse my vote.  But it does tend to focus on particular type of answers, meaning some have really skewed voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>well written (coherent)</li>
<li>plausible</li>
<li>reference a commonly held belief and knowledge</li>
<li><strong>entirely wrong</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>They draw up-votes too fast which, when the reader discovers that the answer was wrong, are already locked in.  At-best they can only upvote a correct answer and leave it <strong>side-by-side</strong> with a wrong answer.  There are times when we up / down vote an aswer because our knowledge is wrong rather than a misclick.</p>
<p>The suggestion that the wrong answer will over time be lost in upvotes on other answers ignores the reality of most stack-exchange questions.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wonder if it would be possible / be a good idea, to allow users to unlock a (very low) percentage of votes.</p>
<p>It's hard to think of how unlocking 0.5% of votes could cause a significant problem.  It could easily be monitored to ensure unlocking is not directed at a single user.  But while the percentage is low, it might have the effect of re-balancing some answers.</p>

<p>Several people suggested to me to look at <em><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14056/seo-in-stack-overflow"">SEO in Stack Overflow</a></em>, however this would suggest the <strong>opposite</strong> of what is happening. The content on (and linked from) my Stack Overflow profile is definitely richer than on my other profile pages, yet the Stack Overflow page is listed much lower than others.</p>
<p>Also my Stack Overflow profile has more inbound links, so again it should be ranked higher normally.</p>
<hr />
<p>Over the time I have ended up with quite a few profiles across Stack Exchange sites. By far the largest (and still most active) is my Stack Overflow profile, there are a few medium size ones and some others are quite inactive/small.</p>
<p>Recently I googled my own name (same as my username), and I saw several profiles of different Stack Exchange sites, but I actually had to go to the second page to reach Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Currently the first page shows <a href=""https://superuser.com/tour"">Super User</a> and <a href=""https://serverfault.com/tour"">Server Fault</a> which I also used recently, and also <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/tour"">Mathematics</a> and <a href=""https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/tour"">Code Golf</a>, both of which I have not touched in ages.</p>

"353475","Automatically remove all non-meta comments after a certain amount of time","<p><strong>Update</strong>: I was involved in some very useful discussion in comments under @tinkeringbell's answer. It helped clarify some of the arguments against automatic deletion. If there's interest in this discussion, I recommend reading those comments.</p>
<p>I'll also note that this is not a feature request. As per the tags, I'd meant it specifically as only a discussion. Had anything concrete come out of the discussion, I might have then posed a particular feature for implementation.</p>
<hr />
<p>I propose that all comments on non-meta sites be automatically removed after a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>It's well known that comments are ephemeral, and that if you think something is worthwhile in terms of addressing a question, it should be provided as an actual answer. Only answers are permanent. As such, there should be no expectation that comments won't be removed at any given time.</p>
<p>Having comments automatically deleted would enforce this message and also aid in site cleanup.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is something that is constantly being brought up—the <em>Why was my comment deleted?</em> question. The response to that is always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not personal.</li>
<li>Your comment was removed because it was part other comments that weren't serving a purpose.</li>
<li>The comment was an answer in the form of a comment, not a comment that was helping to clarify the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for comments underneath answers, if the person leaving it objects to the answer or wants to enhance it, they can provide an alternate answer of their own (or, in the case of disagreement, simply downvote). If the person who provided the answer doesn't agree, the comment isn't going to make them change their mind if it remains for an extended period of time.</p>
<hr />
<p>By making it explicitly clear that comments are ephemeral and <em>not</em> permanent, and then actually enforcing that automatically, it would help with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complaints of comments being deleted in the first place.<br>If it's a stated fact that <em>every</em> comment will be deleted after a certain period of time, then complaints against those deleting them will be avoided. It becomes a function of the system, not of any particular moderator—whose deletions might or might not be consistent with those of other moderators.</li>
<li>The <em>appearance</em> of favouritism on the part of moderators.<br>If everybody's comments are treated identically (over time), there can be no favouritism.</li>
<li>The maintenance burden on moderators.<br>If comments are automatically deleted after a certain period of time, moderators don't need to worry about routine comment cleanup; they need only concern themselves with those particular comments of a uniquely negative nature that require immediate attention.</li>
<li>The inappropriate nature of some comments.<br>If you know that your comment won't last long, it would force you to consider if you want to leave it at all, or if you should do something more appropriately permanent—such as leave an actual answer to a question.</li>
</ul>
<p>A corollary to this is some kind of better notification that comments <em>are</em> ephemeral, perhaps by extending the <em>add a comment</em> text to <em>add a X-day comment</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am excluding the meta sites from this, since I know that comments in metas have a longer-lasting effect and purpose. However, even with the meta sites, it might make sense to include automatic deletion, albeit after a longer retention period.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am also not mentioning a particular time period, because I'm not certain what would actually be appropriate. Some of the things that would be addressed by this would benefit from a shorter time period, while others would benefit from a longer time period.</p>
<p>The minimum period of time that comments are useful can vary depending on the frequency of the people checking questions and answers, as well as those engaged in a &quot;comment discussion&quot; that could lead to a worthwhile answer.</p>
<p>I don't think most people would say <em>any</em> comment serves a real purpose after a month, let alone a year. However, some serve no purpose at all at any time. So, some kind of sliding-scale-of-diminishing returns balance would need to be struck.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to think that no comment serves a useful purpose—in terms of question or answer clarification—after 2 days? A week?</p>

"354551","Walled gardens and Stack Overflow content","<p>One of the greatest benefits of Stack Overflow is that it's not a walled garden. Content is accessible to everyone who searches for the answer to a question.</p>
<p>It is similar to what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Usenet</a> forums used to be back in the 1990s and early 2000s. People would post questions on those forums and volunteers would answer.</p>
<p>There were some great forums back in those days that I used a lot such as comp.lang.c++, however recently I've noticed a turn to people asking questions in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slack</a> channels related to the technology they are using.</p>
<p>There are Slack channels for C++, AWS, F#/.NET, etc., but the problem with this is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>They are walled gardens. If someone answers your question in there that information is not shared with the global community. In fact it's lost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It relies on the that person being available to answer the question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, I've used some niche libraries written in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F#</a> and got answers directly from the author of that library in the relevant Slack channel, which is great for me, but the problem is that person who is an expert in that library won't be around forever, and will probably lose interest in a few years and stop being regularly on that Slack channel.</p>
<p>So my question is: Is there a way that a plugin can read data from these places and somehow integrate it with Stack Overflow?</p>
<p>Of course, this can also apply to other Stack Exchange sites as well.</p>

"354848","Feedback for rude comments","<p>I participate in a site where people are very sensitive about... well, everything. I've had comments of mine being deleted ever since I can remember, and I used to be ok with that because a) we need to keep things civilized and b) comments are ephemerous at best anyway.</p>
<p>Today however I noticed a case where a potentially constructive comment was removed as rude. Some context: OP was asking about things that could cause political instability in a fictional world. Another user commented something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You could have a look at the general history of pre-WW2 Europe for a real world example of such a scenario.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not the comment verbatim. I don't have access to it because I am not a moderator, and my memory is not perfect. Maybe it was really rude, but let us suppose that it was written exactly as above.</p>
<p>Also, I see how some people can view this kind of commenting as an error. It does not ask for clarifications and it does not suggest improvements to the question; rather, it is an answer in the form of a one-liner. The user who made the comment could have posted a proper answer. But that is not what I'd like to talk about.</p>
<p>In a meta discussion in the site, a moderator said that <a href=""https://worldbuilding.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8050/why-was-my-comment-suggesting-studying-history-deleted"">the comment was deleted for being rude, and not following the &quot;be nice&quot; policy</a>. Fair enough. I am okay with deleting comments if they are seen as rude. But what is rude to a group of people may be customary to another group. Having your comments deleted without warning or notification does not help bridge that gap.</p>
<p>So what I propose is a multipart feature:</p>
<h1>Boilerplate notification</h1>
<p>When you have a comment deleted for being rude, you would receive a notification like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of your comments was deleted for being rude:</p>
<p>[Original comment here]</p>
<p>Please remember that in order to participate in Stack Exchange, you need to observe our policies about <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/behavior"">being nice</a> to other people. Be welcoming and patient, especially with those who may not know everything you do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or some similar text, and the link would point to the same help section but for the relevant site (specially for localization in the case of non-English stacks).</p>
<h1>Custom notification</h1>
<p>As an extra, moderators could have the option to add some text explaining what in the message was rude. The user would receive some notification as above, but the moderator in charge of the deletion could <strong>optionally</strong> also type something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello John Doe. I understand what you meant here but please notice that [some expression here] is considered condescending in many places. Please try to communicate in a way that is more friendly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please notice that I have never been a moderator; I don't know if moderators can already do this when contacting a user, so if that is the case, please ignore this part.</p>
<h1>Comment Review Queue</h1>
<p>Last but not least, it would be nice if regular, non-mod users could handle flags on comments. This could take some load off moderators, and call the community's attention when someone is actually being rude. This could be a queue for users with 10,000+ reputation, which is generally <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-tools"">when you are trusted enough to have access to moderator tools</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have seen a similar question: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/323060/221728"">Could we provide some automatic feedback on (enough) unfriendly/rude comments?</a> But that one is about warning when a user has had too many comments marked as rude so that they think before commenting. This one here is about letting people know exactly what comments of theirs are being considered rude so that they can learn about improving their comments.</p>

<p>You want to share some piece of knowledge you've been searching for. You finally took the time to look it up; you tested it, and it works; you're a generous spirit, and you want to share it with the world. You take the time to write up the whole thing – as a community wiki answer, no less. Seconds after you post the whole write-up (question + answer), another user decides to downvote the question for some reason. No comment, no explanation, no nothing – just one singular downvote.</p>
<p>The next five users who see the question also see the &quot;-1&quot;, so they think there must be something wrong with either the question or the answer – they neither upvote, nor downvote. The next five users do the same. The next five, the same – and so on, until someone breaks the chain.</p>
<p>But there is no chain. There is only a single downvote, cast by that singular first user who decided for some reason to downvote at first sight. The &quot;chain&quot; is just the accident of having a negative person notice the thing first – there could also be a positive &quot;chain&quot; if the accident happened the other way around.</p>
<p>I looked up similar conversations related to hiding votes for questions or answers, and I understand why it's important to give people feedback soon after they post either a question or an answer. Self-answered questions, however – and especially community wiki self-answered questions –, I think people are really making a free effort (both as in freedom, and as in beer) to offer their knowledge to the world. These people don't care about reputation points by definition, or else they wouldn't choose to post a community wiki answer.</p>
<p>If you think that maybe their question/answer content is genuinely crap, there are two separate counter-arguments to that:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the whole thing is just garbage, it will end up being downvoted so badly that it gets naturally kicked out – I'm only proposing temporarily hiding the vote count, not ignoring it;</li>
<li>if only the wording is crap, the content might still be valuable – since we're talking about a community wiki answer, there's still hope someone will rewrite the answer. But if not, see above.</li>

With that in mind, I'm wondering if there are plans for this to change in the future?</p>
<h2>Yes</h2>
<p>The priority is very likely to be low, but is there a target date?</p>
<h2>No</h2>
<p>I assume there's a valid reason, what would that be?</p>
<hr />
<p>My assumptions are that the answer is no, and that the reasoning is the difficulty behind removing everything but <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code> plus additional Unicode characters adds very little value to Stack Exchange while consuming a lot of time to implement.</p>
<p>My question then becomes what's the reasoning behind the restrictions in the first place?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I added the emoji to the question title to test a theory, and remarkably it worked. Why does it work there, but not as a display name?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Wow, I really underestimated how much the general public hates emojis. 😅</p>
<h2>My Thoughts on Commented Points:</h2>
<p><strong>Mentions</strong></p>
<p>The mention system is as simple as typing <code>@</code> and then the user's name. If that user has an emoji in their name you can hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> on a computer if their name is highlighted, or click on it if there are multiple matches. If the user's name is simply an emoji on its own, then that's the one being mentioned's problem as they just won't be able to be notified, since they can't be mentioned.</p>
<p>One possible solution to this issue is to automatically supply emoji only users in the list automatically upon entering <code>@</code> to ensure users can mention them.</p>
<p>Another issue with mentions is the mobile view in web browsers. This has a bug overall that it just doesn't work. It can be adjusted in the future to actually begin working, in which case it would fall back to the desktop functionality.</p>
<p><strong>URL Encoding for User Profiles</strong></p>
<p>URLs are currently encoded anyway since there is nothing to prevent a user from entering a valid character (such as <code>'</code>) that would be encoded with a percentage sign. Take my suggested display name for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taco's-On-Titan = Taco%27s-On-Titan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that even today, users can, and do have encoded links for their Stack Exchange profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Abuse</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is covered in the CoC isn't it?</p>

"356597","Support logging in with Apple","<p>Title explains all.</p>
<hr />
<p>SE currently supports logging in with GitHub, Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>In terms of tracking user behavior, Apple <em>seems</em> to be a better login option to me than Google and Facebook.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reverting to the concerns stated in response to the question:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What benefit it will have?</strong></p>
<p>With users having an option to use a different login service than FB/Google/GitHub, I think they will be able to keep their privacy. At the very least they will be able to decouple their activity on Stack Exchange from Google and Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The feature development is going to cost time.</strong></p>
<p>I can't argue against that. If there are other pressing items to work on in the pipeline, go ahead with them. However, I have worked on security and authentication myself and fairly understand the time this login option can take. Most of it is research than development. I found that after I implemented the first one, others were quicker to implement. I have never implemented Signing in with Apple, but if Single Sign-on with Google and FB is present, Apple should not be hugely different.<sup>*</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is that option going to benefit a substantial number of users?</strong></p>
<p>That's better answered by people working at SE. Or those of use who have access to site's analytics, they can see how many users are accessing SE network from macOS/iOS/iPadOS. I think if properly implemented, a majority of SE users on Apple's OSes will gladly make the switch. A &quot;proper&quot; implementation could be along the lines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow new users to Sign in with Apple;</li>
<li>Give the current users an option to move to Signing in with Apple;</li>
<li>After migrating the existing users delete their older login info;</li>
<li>Alternate to step - 3, have people create new account by Signing in with Apple and then merge their current account with that.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way they retain the profile and rep but trackers can't link their activity on SE with their activity elsewhere on the web. Apple's users are generally very quick to adopt the latest. This is something that Apple proudly states in their events too.</p>
<p>Of course this is based on the faith that SE does a good job of deleting PII that users have provided earlier.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>We had to de-ship Open ID.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in hindsight it may well turn out that Signing in with Apple was not as popular as thought. So this effort becomes a risk that doesn't pay off. However, as people are becoming more and more aware of their privacy online, when they will see an option that gives them convenience (Single signing on with Google / FB / GitHub (aka Microsoft)) and an option that gives them convenience and privacy (Single sign-on with Apple), then if they can pick the second option, they will pick it.</p>
<p>Even if the existing users do not migrate, the new users will use it because for them Signing in with Google or FB is exact same effort as Signing in with Apple.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Creating an account on SE sells you out to only SE.</strong></p>
<p>Not true. There are multiple trackers embedded in SE pages. In fact <strong>on this very page that you are reading there is one tracker each from the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Google;</li>
<li>Quantcast;</li>
<li>comScore.</li>
</ol>
<p>On a 'Hot Question' on a Stack Overflow page that I opened, apart from the three above, there were two trackers from Google.</p>
<p>However, it is true that to block those trackers you do not need a full-fledged Sign in with Apple. Latest Safari (v 14.0.1) blocks them today. If you're not on Safari, you can install DuckDuckGo extension on whichever browser you are using and hide your ass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>To make a stronger case of why this option is something to be taken seriously and could be well worth developers' time, this is a screenshot of the latest spam I received. The only place I have even used the word 'vacuum' is in a comment I made on this question itself. Otherwise I have no issues with my vacuum cleaners and have not spoken about them to anyone.</p>
<p>Because I visited this page a few times to respond to the activity on it, 'selling a vacuum cleaner' was identified to be a critical thing for me by data harvesters.</p>

"356819","Could the bounty system be more fair when bounty owners are ""forgetful""?","<p>Nowadays, bounties are often set on very specific, complex questions that are subject to require more work from those who will provide answers, and which would probably be of lesser interest to other SO users.</p>
<p>In this regard, bounties play two roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the person's posting the question and offering the bounty, it helps grab more visibility on their question, since it will be promoted to a distinct list of questions.</li>
<li>For persons answering the question, it provides an incentive in putting more efforts on that question, rather that on some other that might be easier to answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the second role is <em>required</em> for the bounty system to be coherent for that type of question. It is in some way a <em>promise</em> made by the bounty offerer that they will reward a good quality answer. Otherwise, there would be little interest from the answerer's point of view in putting <em>significantly more effort</em> in answering a question <em>that would help only one person</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once the bounty has been set up, there is absolutely no incentive for the bouncy offerer to react in a timely manner in regard with that bounty. From their point of view, they gained the extra visibility they wanted, and they will benefit from an answer, no matter if it comes before of after the bounty's expiration. Unfortunately, that means that very good answers, posted well in time, may get accepted a few hours or or a few days after the bounty has expired.</p>
<p>It has been said <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/160151/237776"">elsewhere</a> &quot;Just don't start a bounty when you're not sure you can award it in time&quot;, and I also think so, but this claim is taken from the bounty offerer's perspective. Now, as an answerer, I have no way to know that the bounty offerer will show respect to those who will take time to do research and answer his question.</p>
<p>Could there be some work done in order to make it more fair for users that have contributed answers on bountied questions when the bounty offerer doesn't honor is duty to review and accept answers before the end of the bounty's grace period?</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it possible for the bounty offerer to award the bounty some time after the expiration of the grace period if the bounty was not automatically awarded.</li>
<li>Add a &quot;request for bounty moderation&quot; flag so that a moderator can review the timeline and determine if a deserved bounty was lost because of a fault from the bounty offerer's part.</li>
<li>Grant some badge to those who have contributed answers to bountied questions, which got accepted after the expiration of the bounty.</li>
<li>Penalize bounty offerers that do not &quot;review&quot; submitted answers before the expiration of the grace period.</li>

As it stands right now, users can vote on an election that might not be particularly active. While I can understand that, I also believe there should be the ability for users to recommend a user. I'm not quite sure how this should be limited, perhaps based on reputation, recent activity, or even limited to current (Former?) moderators on the site. </p>

<p>Some time ago, comments were allowed on an election post. These comments could be voted on. The comments were kept throughout the election process. I believe something like that is beneficial.</p>

<p>This would somewhat counter the person who is well known because they answer a lot of questions, but would make a horrible moderator, or perhaps the quiet person who is always in the background, but can't write a compelling vote for me speech, and isn't as well known.</p>

<p>In summary, here's a few quick thoughts on the idea.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should be short (No more than about 2 sentences worth)</li>
<li>Should a way for others to indicate their approval/disapproval.</li>
<li>Should include both favorable and unfavorable endorsements.</li>
<li>The name of the user making the endorsement should be visible.</li>
<li>Perhaps a 5 star rating of the candidate? Or at least a thumbs up/ down.</li>
<li>These should be limited, perhaps to those with more than 1000 reputation or something? I'm not quite sure where the dividing line should be. Ability to vote on them should be similarly limited. Both should be higher than the normal voting limits.</li>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Fleshing out my thinking in response to the first response I received below.</p>

<p>Their business models are different, but in a general sense, the two are here to educate.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange mission statement: <a href=""https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/09/five-years-ago-stack-overflow-launched-then-a-miracle-occurred/"">Make the Internet a better place to get expert answers to your questions.</a></p>

<p>This being the Internet, we have the option of networking resources, for the potential enrichment of all. If a Stack Exchange question is locked, it becomes more or less canonized. It is less pliable than Wikipedia at that point. Thus Stack&nbsp;Overflow becomes less QA at points, and more encyclopedia-like.</p>

"276201","Automatically delete negatively-scored answers after a time","<p>Downvoted, unanswered questions have been subject to automatic deletion for a long time. The same is not true of downvoted answers.</p>

<p>On Super User, we have <a href=""https://superuser.com/search?q=is%3Aa+score%3A..-2+created%3A..1-1-2016+isaccepted%3Ano"">almost ten thousand non-accepted negatively-scored answers</a> posted before the beginning of this year still in existence. Over two thousand of those are scored at -2 or below, having been downvoted by multiple people.</p>

<p>I see no reason to keep these answers around. Based on the votes, they have helped nobody. They're just sitting there, being pointless, borderline-NAA, or otherwise bad. Low quality (but not flag-worthy) posts aren't actively harmful, but don't provide a good image for the site. Additionally, I think people would be a lot more likely to downvote bad things if they knew there was a good chance for the -1 to be refunded in the future if somebody else agreed. (And hey, the poster would get the -2 refunded as well.)</p>

<p>To prevent people from adding single downvotes to cause quick deletion of things they don't like, it would probably be good to require a score of at most -2 before an answer is eligible for auto-deletion. Accepted answers (that aren't self-answers) shouldn't be deleted, since they helped someone. A reasonable time frame for the deletion of -2 answers would be a month after they hit that score; the process would optimally be accelerated by additional downvotes and slowed significantly by any upvotes.</p>

<p>I understand now that some downvoted answers should stick around to show an example of something subtly bad. To prevent those from going away, the presence of numerous comments or somewhat-highly-upvoted comments could be a factor against deletion. I still believe that many downvoted answers are just mediocre/useless and not representative of any common misconception. (See the Super User search linked above.)</p>

"276240","Format or highlight file:/// strings in yellow, denoting folders/file-locations","<p>There needs to be a way to make the content more scannable by adding a filesystem highlight formatting option to posts.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a zoomed-out post, where the yellow line is there to mark out a filepath location.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/M0A6Z.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/M0A6Z.png"" alt=""An long-text, fully-zoomed-out SE article is shown, a folder name is highlighted in yellow by wired-marker, and the question &quot;whereis&quot; is written in purple across the top of the image.""></a></p>

<p>Here's an example on <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-program-used-open-email-links?esab=a&amp;as=aaq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Mozilla support article with a more readable format</a> where they use highlighting for filenames and other items (buttons, menu items), making the steps easier to visually encode.</p>

<p>Currently I'm using a workaround of installing <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wired-marker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wired-Marker</a> add-on for Firefox.</p>

<h2>Justifications</h2>

<ul>
<li>Typically a linked URI is shown in blue, underscored text; therefore, a more global work-around would be links containing the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""file"" protocol</a> <code>file:///</code>, which could then be used in coding blocks to minimize ""abuse cases"" (e.g., <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>file:///</code></a>.)</li>
<li>Minimizes abuse cases for tag, sub, sup, and code blocks</li>
<li>!Increases accessibility for low vision and speed reading</li>
<li>Decreases reviewing time for content being reviewed for memorization or reference</li>
<li>!Makes content more aesthetically pleasing (articles seem less intimidating and are easier to enjoy reading)</li>
<li>The community <strong>is</strong> intelligent enough to use a more complicated interface, so 'why not'</li>
<li>Obviates the need of browser extensions to work around the <em>slovenly</em> default-interface</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Past content should be left as-is unless being (actively) reviewed</li>
<li>Prefer using actual file locations when they are handy</li>
<li>!Use with <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/local-filesystem-links/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Local Filesystem Links</a> on Firefox</li>
<li>Simple to code and does not require washing of existing content; users can simply use the new feature on future posts, old posts can be left as-is and updated only if the author deems it appropriate</li>
<li>Programmers love syntax highlighting meaning the community will likely be very satisfied with the update; so, 'why not'</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design indication</h2>

<p>Readers want their eyes naturally drawn to important content when scanning for meta language (a frequent practice in <a href=""https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/gist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reading for the gist</a>).</p>

<p>Notice how the eye is naturally drawn to the yellow text in the image first. This is because the object moving during scrolling is the yellow object in human perception; our peripheral vision moves to this item implicitly, as an instinctual defense action (tracking fast-moving objects to notice predators).  Coded blocks require more searching.</p>

<h2>Comparison exercise</h2>

<p>After noting how long it takes to find the yellow text on the first image, do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write down the time it took to find the yellow text: (ex. <code>Yellow-find=0.01sec</code>.)</li>
<li>Read the comments by the Sundanese-named author,  ᔕᖺᘎᕊ (pronunciation needed)</li>
<li>Select which number the emboldened text is next to, as quickly as possible</li>
<li>Write the time it took to find the <strong>emboldened</strong> text in the image: (ex. <code>Bold-find=4.7sec</code>.)</li>
<li>Publish your results if nobody else has and answer the following: ""Could you tell the difference between the bold and non-bold text?""</li>

"276621","I suggest a mechanic to improve quality of life for questions that could be improved","<h2> Problem </h2>

<p>A problem I've noticed on certain networks is that questions which have potential, need improvement, and could be salvaged are quickly down-voted and closed <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/312062/is-it-possible-to-systematically-port-other-languages-to-javascript?noredirect=1#comment658780_312062"">and even deleted</a> within the first few hours. </p>

<p>This kind of self moderation skips the possibility of training users to ask better questions over time in a constructive way. By instead leaving a comment suggesting how questions could be improved when applicable, instead of being cut down instantly for asking a ""bad question"", users can instead be educated on how to make their questions better. </p>

<p>I've experienced this myself with great success on many sites where my questions showed effort to meet the scope definitions, but I needed a little help here and there to really get the feel for how to mold my curiosities into good questions on various networks where the scope can be a bit odd. This avoided the negative feelings of a bunch of down-votes being laid on my questions, and I felt like I was in a friendly place where people where willing to help teach me to become a productive member of their community. </p>

<p>But with current mechanics for voting I find the opposite can happen, depending on the behavior of a community's most active members. Even one or two users who like to pull the trigger and kill questions rather than improve them can, over a long period of time, cause a lot of damage instead of the alternate possibility of improving the question output quality of thousands of users. This effect is compounded, when you consider the looming factor of the first positive or negative or close vote greatly increasing the likelihood that the next person will follow suit. Basic human psychology. </p>

<p>Anyway, I've created my case, now I'll suggest a potential solution.</p>

<h2> Solution </h2> 

<p>When people view a new question in the question queue, they want to either answer it, close it, vote on it, or a combination of the three. And if they don't do that right away, the question moves down the queue, and more pile up, so leaving a comment suggesting improvement may be forgotten and a poorly worded question gets through. That's probably why some people down-vote and vote to close without suggesting improvement, creating the bad effects described above. </p>

<p>But what if we had (and this is a very open, rough draft beginning to a solution) a mechanic for allowing users to vote to put a question in a temporary ""potentially improved"" state where the question could be salvaged if the user follows commented suggestions for improvement. </p>

<p>During this state:</p>

<ul>
<li>negative votes are not shown until the state ends</li>
<li>the question is hidden from being displayed in the unanswered question queue</li>
<li>the question will be put on hold automatically at the end of the period, and the negative votes cast will be shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>and if users vote that the question has been improved before the state's timer ends, negative votes cast are discarded, never having been revealed to the user, and everyone wins. People can cast the votes when the question gets into the queue, and the negative actions are tallied but withheld temporarily, meanwhile the user gets an opportunity to improve his question with no bad feelings, follow the advise in the comments, and potentially improve his question and have a good experience on the network. </p>

<p>With a mechanic like this, or something similar, maybe a twist, such as including this mechanic as an option when voting to put the question on hold, perhaps would be intuitive and require fewer changes for the UI.</p>

<p>A benefit to this strategy is that it's purely user driven, doesn't require an advanced algorithm for each site on the network to launch as a feature like a related solution in the comments would, and a few users with enough rep can effectively and proactively utilize this tool to protect its newer users from the itchy trigger fingers of other users on their network, creating a more friendly environment while not damaging the effectiveness of self moderation in any way. </p>

"277009","Can you add superuser and stackoverflow hosts?","<p>The logging-in between Stack&nbsp;Exchange sites that have different domain names does not consistently work.</p>

<p>Can you just add superuser and stackoverflow hosts, so that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>superuser.stackexchange.com</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>stackoverflow.stackexchange.com</p>
</blockquote>

<p>will work?</p>

<p><em>(And of course add hosts for the other Stack&nbsp;Exchange sites that have their own domains.)</em></p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE #1:</em></strong> I performed some research, and the above-described failure is likely due to browsers being configured to not accept third-party cookies. Since this is very common nowadays, I recommend just adding a few more hosts to the stackexchange.com domain.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE #2:</em></strong> It looks like the most upvoted answer is incorrect. That answer claims that adding superuser.stackexchange.com and stackoverflow.stackexchange.com ""wouldn't do any good"". But there are 100+ other Stack&nbsp;Exchange sites that show that it does work perfectly (for example <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"">https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/</a> and <a href=""https://android.stackexchange.com/"">https://android.stackexchange.com/</a> and <a href=""https://apple.stackexchange.com/"">https://apple.stackexchange.com/</a>), so I'm not sure why this erroneous claim is being promoted.</p>

<p>Given that this technology <em>does</em> work (which we can't always say!), how do we make it help Stack&nbsp;Exchange instead of hurting it? The answer is simple: add the new hosts (such as <code>superuser.stackexchange.com</code>), but also keep the existing sites exactly as they are (i.e. <code>superuser.com</code>). Then add a simple user-preference toggle to allow users to choose whether to route to <code>superuser.stackexchange.com</code> or <code>superuser.com</code>.</p>

<p>This can be a win-win. The content on <code>superuser.stackexchange.com</code> will be identical to <code>superuser.com</code>, and it will allow people who actually contribute to Stack&nbsp;Exchange (which is a tiny minority - most people only visit but don't contribute) to have a more seamless experience.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, <code>superuser.com</code> and <code>stackoverflow.com</code> will still be the primary advertised sites. But for those contributors who don't allow third-party cookies (really, does anyone still allow those?), we will have a more seamless and usable Stack&nbsp;Exchange experience (which will lead to even more contributing, which helps build Stack&nbsp;Exchange).</p>

<p><code>superuser.com</code> has had a review backlog for quite some time. As a top 10 reviewer of that site, I can tell you I would perform many more reviews if I didn't have to provide login credentials again just for that site.</p>

"278214","Deleting others' work","<p>Recently a question was posted on MathOverflow, which received (I think) more than an average number of upvotes. There was an answer to the question, by someone other than the OP. Next day, the question was deleted by the author (without me seeing any reasons for that), and the answer got thereby deleted as well. I then looked at the OP's page, and he seemed to have gotten a ""Disciplined"" badge for this action! </p>

<p>It does not seem right to me when a person can so easily delete others' work. Moreover, this seems to contain a serious potential for abuse. E.g., it is easy for one to get an email account, open a new MathOverflow account with it, post a question, get an answer, then delete both, and retain and use the undocumented answer. </p>

<p>I am not sure what would be the best way to deal with this problem. I know that, e.g., once a paper appeared on arXiv, it may be withdrawn but never deleted (as I recall, arXiv says it is done in the interests of good scholarship).

"281033","Should the accepted answerer also be able to change the accepted answer?","<p>Probably one of the largest problems I regularly see with the Stack Exchange model is that most people asking questions don't really understand how the system works.  Often questions never get an answer marked as being the answer, which isn't a big deal because the highest voted answer still gives meaningful feedback to anyone viewing the question.</p>

<p>The slightly more rare, but arguably worse situation is when an asker understands enough to mark an answers as the answer, but then goes away and someone else comes along and posts another much better answer.  If the question is kind of on the fringe, it can take quite some time for the vote count to swing in favor of the new, better answer and the OP has long since left.  This leaves a question in a less than desirable state where the inferior answer has both more votes and is marked as the accepted answer.</p>

<p>One possible solution to this would be to allow the accepted answerer to reassign the accepted answer to an answer they feel is better than their own.  People that answer questions tend to be much more active on the site and have a vested interest in trying to make sure that we have the best possible answers to questions.  Additionally, if the answer's answer has been marked as accepted, they clearly had a solid understanding of the question and the details needed for the solution, so it seems like they should be qualified to make changes to the accepted answer.</p>

<p>This came up in response to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33306/why-on-earth-would-anyone-use-the-top-secret-option-of-ipv4/"">this question</a> where the answer provided by Falcon Momot is head and shoulders above my own answer.

"281457","Why is Stack Exchange biased against casual and cosmopolitan users?","<p>The combination of reputation score requirements for site interaction and the heavy splitting of the website into many similar but slightly different sub-sites with independent user accounts creates a frustrating situation for non-power-users.</p>
<p>Here are examples from some situations that I frequently find myself in:</p>
<p>Situation A:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A search for answers to programming-related topics leads me to a page on a Stack Exchange website with a posted answer that seems promising</p>
</li>
<li><p>The posted answer does not work for me, or I could use clarification on the answer; posting a comment on the answer would help solve the issue</p>
</li>
<li><p>It turns out that I am not allowed to post a comment because the question is posted in an obscure Stack Exchange site for which I have no reputation points, and my only option is to post a new question when all I really need is clarification on the previous answer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Case in point: <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/13875/boxplot-for-several-distributions"">Boxplot for several distributions?</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Situation B:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I find answers to relevant questions on an obscure Stack Exchange site which I have never used before, and I decide that it would be an appropriate place to post my own question on a similar topic</p>
</li>
<li><p>After doing a lot of research on the question, I try to put together a quality post with plenty of cross-references to help keep the site's content cross-linked and to help with Google searches</p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to my lack of reputation on said site, my ability to include links in my question is restricted, leading things such as this embarrassingly butchered post: <a href=""https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/95430/private-development-to-do-list-for-an-organizations-public-repository"">https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/95430/private-development-to-do-list-for-an-organizations-public-repository</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this really constitute the site designer's intentions for the site, or is this an unfortunate side-effect of what Stack Exchange has grown into? Take my own account, for example: <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/users/6989882/user5359531?tab=accounts"">https://stackexchange.com/users/6989882/user5359531?tab=accounts</a></p>
<p>I am currently a member of 17 different Stack Exchange sites. 9 of these are directly related to programming in some way (possibly more, subjectively), all with very similar content. Yet I can only post without restrictions in 2 of these sites. I have maintained this account for almost a year now (SO) and use the website daily; the fact that I still cannot post without restrictions on topics I am familiar with or seeking help on seems quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to simply post more answers and get more reputation points, but this begets the title question: &quot;Why is Stack Exchange biased against casual and cosmopolitan users?&quot; If I do build up rep posting answers to R questions in Stack Overflow, I find myself unable to even post a comment on an R question in Cross Validated. Posting worthwhile answers and questions is no small task either, considering that the sheer size and amount of covered by Stack Exchange sites means that in most cases, your question/answer has already been posted.</p>
<p>Is this a topic that the site designers care about enough to devise a solution? Or have we just accepted that &quot;this is the way it is on Stack Exchange&quot;?</p>

"283154","Down-vote reputation penalty is too big","<p>Over my time using many of the Stack forums, I have of course asked questions that others thought weren't adequate. I could hardly see why and frankly, it felt somewhat unfair as I could spot many far worse questions than mine which were getting lots of up-votes.</p>

<p>This conundrum has meant that I have been almost incapable of getting my reputation above 5, making it very difficult to effectively contribute to the sites. I have seen my reputation go from almost 100, all the way down to 20 overnight because of one question or one answer (this is an exaggeration).</p>

<p>It's also not explained well how a question is defined as fitting for this site. Nearly all questions except research-able ones have some degree of opinion tied to them - be it in choice of method or choice of answer where there may be multiple. As a result, almost all of the questions I've had have fallen into this category and have received almost cruel responses. What few comments that are left tend not to offer suggestions for improving a question, but instead simply name a vague problem which is of no help what-so-ever.</p>

<p>This could be improved in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Increasing the reputation penalty to a user who down-votes a question or answer, or add further requirements to allow a down-vote to be acknowledged.</li>
<li>Decreasing the reputation penalty to a user when one of their questions or answers is down-voted.</li>
</ol>

<p>The definition of a good question on this site could also be made more clear and understandable. I've asked questions and gone through the entire page on asking a question - making sure I've ticked every box - and then logged on the next morning to find it's on hold for not being specific enough, despite me virtually spoon-feeding all the information I have to the reader and all of the points related to an answer.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
A slightly more significant change that could happen is that questions could enter an admission phase in which questions may be approved or edits suggested. Once 5 suggestions have been completed or the question remains fully approved for an amount of time, it is published to the forum to be answered. This then makes the down-vote virtually obsolete as all questions would be approved.</p>

<p>My question is what would happen to those edits made by the user after reaching 2K rep points?

"286129","Making Stack Exchange a more inviting place for new users","<p>Stack Exchange is a wonderful and invaluable community... once you're part of it. New users who aren't familiar with how SE works may have a different impression of our community though. For instance, I know a couple programmers with 10+ years of experience that are too scared to post on SE because of how the community responded to their first questions. There are also a number of blog posts / forum topics discussing how pedantic the community can <em>appear</em> to be (<a href=""https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/741.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here is a well-mannered example</a> for instance).</p>
<p>As mentioned in that blog post, Stack Exchange has two main purposes: short-term help with questions and long-term repositories of good questions and answers that can help people in the future with similar questions. Low-quality questions are a serious issue for the latter of the two, and can be aggravating to deal with i.e. &quot;I've closed countless questions today -- why can't users do something as simple as read question asking guidelines before posting?!&quot; In consequence, low-quality questions are forcefully evicted from the site.</p>
<p>If we're looking to improve new user experience, this is a place we can work on. The below items may seem trivial, but UX can have substantially more impact than it appears to have at face value.</p>
<h1>Negative feedback lingers even after questions are revised</h1>
<p>I asked <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/344021/wishful-thinking-to-the-point-of-lunacy"">a question</a> a while back and it ended up coming off slightly rant-y despite my intentions. Someone commented that this was a potential issue, and the question ended up being downvoted at least once. I agreed with the comment, revised my question, yet to this day I still have a downvote on it. It doesn't make much of a difference when weighted with the upvotes and the activity on the question, but this may not always be the case.</p>
<p>Imagine I post a question that isn't particularly noteworthy but my wording is off. I get a couple downvotes, I revise, but the negative feedback still lingers. As a new user, I would feel shunned. When it comes to downvotes, even though I tried to improve myself and my question, the community spit on me and didn't look back.</p>
<h1>Downvotes aren't always accompanied with explanation</h1>
<p>In the question I linked in the previous section, it may have been the case that the downvote lingering isn't actually because of my initial wording of the question. Maybe it's something completely different. I have no clue why it was downvoted though, and as a result, have no idea what I can improve. Will my question forever have an issue because I don't know what's wrong with it? A specific and arbitrary example is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35779178/what-is-the-equivalent-of-string-in-c"">this question</a>. It has downvotes, but no one bothered to explain why. How is the asker supposed to know what's wrong with it?</p>
<h1>Closing topics gives off the wrong impression</h1>
<p>As a new user, say I post a low-quality question and it gets closed. For discussion's sake, let's say it was too broad. This gives me the impression that my <em>question</em> was bad and that it shouldn't be on SE. The true issue was that my presentation was wrong and that my question is still valuable. Even as someone who's used SE for a couple years and understands that closing, revision, and re-opening of questions is standard procedure and nothing personal, I can't help but feel bad inside and slightly ostracized from the community. Using the wording &quot;on hold&quot; instead of &quot;closed&quot; for the first five days doesn't make me feel less bad either.</p>
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<p>I've been a member of SE for two years, but I'm not an avid user of SE. I'm not so presumptuous to claim that particular ideas are the best solutions for these problems. The following are ideas that are meant to be taken into consideration when developing solutions to the above issues rather than solutions meant to be implemented as-is.</p>
<h3>Negative lingering feedback</h3>
<p>I think moving question feedback to behind the scenes would be a good idea. As a non-participant viewer of the question, whether I found it from a Google search or I'm just browsing SE, I want to see a discussion that is relevant — not idiosyncrasies of SE like &quot;please use the right tag&quot;. As someone answering a question, I'm also not concerned with those same things.</p>
<p>Moderation-related topics like tag usage, duplicate suggestions, etc are only relevant to users interested in moderation, and as such comments aren't really the most appropriate place for these kinds of topics. In the perfect SE, I see discussion of moderation in a separate environment from Q&amp;A. A similar feature can be found in wikis in the form of talk pages where the contents of the page are discussed. This will ensure that moderation doesn't interfere with Q&amp;A, new viewer bias due to comments pointing out issues is no longer an issue, and the question isn't branded as &quot;that bad question&quot;.</p>
<h3>Downvotes without explanation</h3>
<p>This could potentially be resolved by augmenting downvotes with flags. Flagging would have to be expanded to support this though. See a question that's too broad? You could downvote it, but optimally you'd flag it as too broad, the question is automatically downvoted, and the poster is notified specifically how their question can be improved. This could also help with the previous point — if a question was flagged+downvoted 5 times due to being too broad and put on-hold, if and when the question is revised and re-opened, poof all of the no longer relevant downvotes are removed.</p>
<h3>Closing topics gives off the wrong impression</h3>

"286145","Question Deletions: Why does Stack Exchange not want to be Reference of Answers?","<p>19 days ago I asked a question on the apple.stackexchange site. It turned out to be a fairly niche question and got no answers, but yesterday I found the solution and, trying to be a good citizen, I went back to the question to answer it so that it could act as a reference item - a solution for people in future who have that problem.</p>

<p>Of course it had been automatically deleted, and needs 5 votes re-instate it (which is obviously never going to happen because it's a niche question). But clearly other people are going to have that same problem, and now they've been denied the solution their problem.</p>

<p>Another example: On <a href=""http://jyaml.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://jyaml.sourceforge.net</a> there is the following notice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice: I am no longer maintaining JYaml. See this this Q&amp;A for a list of alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Q&amp;A referenced is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/450399/which-java-yaml-library-should-i-use"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/450399/which-java-yaml-library-should-i-use</a></p>

<p>This question, and all the answers, has been deleted. The message on the page reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question was removed from Stack Overflow for reasons of moderation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The reason is most likely is that the question asks for an opinion about the relative utility of the libraries, which is clearly a total outlandish and unreasonable thing to do, and which obviously no-one would find useful).</p>

<p>Two points: Much of the success of SO has been based around the perception that it is a reference resource of solutions to problems, and yet by arbitrarily deleting (not closing, deleting) questions the SO maintainers are setting out to undermine SO's usefulness as a reference resource.</p>

<p>Secondly, the internet is built as a network of links spanning multiple domains. By deleting Q&amp;As, SO is consciously breaking the Internet and being a bad citizen.</p>

<p>So, since deleting whole Q&amp;As is a bad thing to do, for multiple reasons, what is the driving force that makes SO believe that deletions are necessary?</p>

<p>[Edit: to clarify, I'm asking why deletion is the preferred option rather than removing the article from search indexes (which wouldn't break the Internet), or just making bad questions rank much lower than good questions. Deletion is such a crowbar solution.]</p>

<p>[Edit #2: Good old archive.org. Here's the archived version of the deleted page <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20141017030258/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/450399/which-java-yaml-library-should-i-use"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://web.archive.org/web/20141017030258/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/450399/which-java-yaml-library-should-i-use</a></p>

<p>Isn't this issue long overdue for some community love?  Isn't it time to consider automatic Graduation?</p>

<p>Specifically, can't StackExchange replace its constraint based process that poses criteria for graduating from <strong>Beta</strong> to <strong>Live</strong>, a process that assumes sites will FAIL and looks for difficult-to-establish evidence of their success (where evidence of success is hard-to-define), with one that recognizes that most sites that have already made it to <strong>Beta</strong> are succeeding to some degree, and are well on their way to going <strong>Live</strong> and instead look for much more tangible evidence of their failure?</p>

<p>The proposal is to have sites automatically graduate to <strong>Live</strong> after a trial period unless some clear constraints are met that suggest the site is failing.</p>

"292876","Update old returning users with changes to Stack Overflow/Super User/Stack Exchange intended usage","<p>So I stopped using Stack Overflow, Super User, and Stack Exchange maybe a year after Stack Exchanges came into existence. I recently had a need to start reusing the sites again and <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1192001/how-do-i-disable-the-lock-screen-on-windows-phone"">asked this question on Super User</a>. At the time that I stopped using the website, this was definitely the appropriate place to ask the question as there were no alternative places to ask. There weren't even that many promoted Exchanges yet and certainly none that were Windows Phone specific (I was fairly active on the early Area 51 website). So it came as a bit of a shock that I was immediately downvoted and told to post elsewhere.</p>

<p>This may seem like a niche use case, but shouldn't changes to the intended usage policy be told to the user in a banner of some sort? Especially when it comes to Super User since that was basically the <em>de facto</em> place to post most non-programming questions prior to Stack Exchange existing.</p>

These are usually very elementary level questions / answers as well, so of course they get the most traffic from beginner folks.</p>

<p>Not to bash anyone specifically, it's no user's fault the scoring is linear, but here's an example: <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11285961/how-to-make-a-background-transparent-20-in-android/16890937#16890937"">How to make a background 20% transparent on Android</a></em>.</p>

<p>I mean come on. The top answers for this are basically half the reputation points for the two users that answered it. Yes, it's helped a bunch of folks, but it will continue to rake in the reputation dough for eternity.  Even the Beatles (or whoever owns the rights) don't pull in the same royalties per song played as they did when first released and were top of the charts.</p>

<p>The whole idea of a point system encourages competition, but this almost discourages folks spending time on difficult/challenging questions (outside those which have hefty bonuses).</p>

<p>How about a logarithmic scale that kicks in after say 100 votes on a question or answer?</p>

"296084","Where can I ask this? (computers, networking, routers, TCP/IP)","<p>I have a technical question about a network problem in an industrial production environment.   They didn't like it in the <strong>Network Engineering</strong> because we use what they called ""consumer grade"" devices.   We make manufacturing equipment that runs 24/7 in the aerospace industry and if you've ever flown a modern aircraft there's a good chance it was built using our ""consumer grade"" equipment, but it's still not up to their standard.  They didn't like it on <strong>Software Engineering</strong> because I asked  what tools I could use to analyze the problem and tools are off-topic.   And since it's not about coding or programming languages (and also might involve tools) it's not a good fit for <strong>Stack Overflow</strong>.   <strong>Super-user</strong> seems to be more for enthusiasts and hobbyists than for production environments.   <strong>Server Fault</strong> seems more enterprise IT oriented.   I've attached my question below -   where does this belong?</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>My company makes industrial manufacturing equipment which is
  controlled from a Windows 7 PC. We also supply a ""remote control""
  which is an Android app running on a Samsung smartphone that we
  supply. The Android device talks to the PC via a WAP (wireless access
  point) - we've tried this with DLinks and Buffalo Air Stations, which
  is connected to the PC via an ethernet cable. So...</p>
  
  <p><strong>PC</strong> =====cable==== <strong>WAP</strong> - - -WiFi- - - <strong>ANDROID DEVICE</strong></p>
  
  <p>Most of the time this works fine but on one particular system (which
  happens to be my system) if there is no activity for EXACTLY 1 minute
  then when the PC attempts to send a TCP packet to the Android it gets</p>
  
  <p><em>Err=10053,Desc=Connection is aborted due to timeout or other failure</em></p>
  
  <p>from winsock, and on Wireshark we see</p>
  
  <p><em>10.1.2.1 10.1.2.11 TCP 60 40574→181 [RST] Seq=14 Win=0 Len=0</em></p>
  
  <p>... where 10.1.2.1 is the IP address of the Android and 10.1.2.11 is
  the PC.</p>
  
  <p>So it would seem that the Android is timing out at 1 minute, right?
  (like a battery-saving strategy). <strong>BUT</strong> -</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>This only happens when talking with my PC and WAP, not with other WAP/PC combo's we have here.  We've tried this with several Android
  and PC/WAP setups.</li>
  <li>The Android is set to leave WiFi ""always on""</li>
  <li>If I interrogate the socket on the Android while this is happening, it still thinks it's open and listening.</li>
  <li>if I try to send a packet to the PC from the Android after the 1-minute mark it, the Android/Java socket reports ""Exception ...sendto
  failed: ECONNRESET (Connection reset by peer)"" (i.e., it seems to
  think the <em>other</em> side reset it.)</li>
  <li>Also, we can still ping the Android from the PC when it's getting RSTs (granted ping is ICMP, not TCP).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>So something is timing out, but what? Can my WAP time-out? Can the
  WiFi layer of the connection time-out, as opposed to the socket layer,
  and why would that only happen with my PC/WAP and not others? (and how
  could I detect this?) What kinds of tests, tools or experiments might
  illuminate this? Is there a way to ""listen to"" the TCP communication
  between the PC and Android?</p>

"296184","Set a minimum reputation for editing","<p>Yesterday, on Travel.SE, I stumbled in a sequence of edits to reviews that were just ""user removed post content and substituted with spam content"".</p>

<p>At first I thought the user was defacing his own posts, then I realized he was editing other users posts ('cause he edited one of mines). Then I noticed he/she/it had just one reputation and I thought that maybe he found a way to hack the site, so I asked on Travel Meta and got confirmation that everybody can edit everyone's post, because there is the review queue to filter out spammer.</p>

<p>Now, I'm confused.</p>

<p>On the SE network you need reputations even to be allowed to breathe; there is a entry level for everything apart from spamming the site? Seriously? I need a minimum rep even to add images to <strong>my</strong> questions, but I can choke the review queue with just a bunch of freshly registered accounts?</p>

<p>I think, I strongly think, that editing someone else's post should be allowed only with a minimum rep, let say 20. There is no way a user that never posted a question, that never posted an answer, then never ever used the site, has any real interest in spending its time editing other peoples posts apart for malicious intents.</p>

"297455","Criteria for earning moderation privileges should include time spent on the site","<p>Based on reputation earned, SE sites give different types of privileges to users.</p>
<p><strong>I am only talking about moderation privileges, which have some serious impacts on the community.</strong> For example (editing, close and reopen votes, access to moderation privileges).</p>
<p>The privilege will also be lost if the rep goes below the required limit.</p>
<h1>The Scenario</h1>
<p>I have seen many users, mainly on Stack Overflow, that have just created an account less than 10-20 days and already have reputation of more than 1000 earned from bounties.</p>
<p>A person, with 9 days on the site, earned almost 850 and another one, from 23, earned 1.8k.</p>
<p>In such a case, within a week, they may get the privilege to approve suggested edits and also edit inline.</p>
<p>Within some more days, they will be able to cast close and reopen votes.</p>
<h1>The Issue</h1>
<p>As said, they are noobs in SE and they may mot have an exact idea of how the community works.</p>
<p>To make it clear, assume that a person earned 2k rep in 10 days from bounties, he can edit inline. But he may not aware of when a post should be edited.</p>
<p>There may be chances of misusing the privileges. It is not their fault but they may not aware of the flow of community from experience.</p>
<p>Also there may be chances of people editing other's posts to abuse (It has already happened on SO many times).</p>
<h1>The suggestion</h1>
<p><strong>Along with reputation, have some other criteria in order to gain a privilege.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Edit Questions And Answers - 2000 rep and should have at least 100 approved suggested edits.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cast Close And Reopen Votes - 3000 rep and should have at least 100 helpful flags.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access To Moderator Tools - 10000 rep and should complete 1000 review tasks in at least one review queue.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><em>This happens only in rare cases. But I found people with 4k rep in 40 days too.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>So, giving such privileges to Rep Hunters is not a good idea because there may be chances of misusing the privilege.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One more feature request - Trusted user privilege should be obtained only if they have a Marshal, Copy editor and at least 2 steward badges.</strong></p>
<p>Marshal - raise 500 helpful flags.</p>
<p>Copy Editor - Edit 500 posts</p>
<p>Steward - complete at least 1000 review items in one review queue.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a side request, don't apply this on beta as well as small sites.</p>
<p>Please implement it in SO as an experimental/beta feature to see the result.</p>

"297529","Can we help users avoid ""mark of shame"" badges?","<p>Several badges are effectively a ""negative"" tag on a user. For example, Peer Pressure is a permanent mark that a user had a post with unusually high numbers of downvotes at one point; the fact that they deleted it may be encouraging, but if they'd baited other users to delete it (or better still, edited it so that it attracted upvotes to cancel out the downvotes), there'd be no such black mark in the user's profile.</p>

<p>There are some other similar badges:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Fanatic family (indicating that a user wastes time on Stack Exchange continuously rather than taking breaks), which could potentially cause problems for future employment (I know that I intentionally have to take a break every now and then rather than risk getting anywhere near being awarded the badge, in case it causes trouble for me in future);</li>
<li>Famous Question, on many sites, is an indicator that you submitted a question that's excessively subjective and not a good fit for the site (these questions tend to get more views), and the badge can be followed to find the offending question in question;</li>
<li>Promotor/Investor without a matching Altruist/Benefactor can give the impression that you don't award bounties, making your future bounties less valuable (and can happen naturally if no answers are given to the question); this is a lesser issue because it's not permanent, but it can still be an issue temporarily</li>
<li>Tumbleweed implies that a user has asked a low (but not ""very low"") quality, uninteresting question, which is typically a bad thing</li>
<li>The Publicist family implies that a user has used Stack Exchange referral links; this is (perhaps unsurprisingly) seen very negatively by many people outside Stack Exchange</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the badge that prompted me to ask this question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scholar, on a site where accepting answers is deemed to actively drive away users from the site (source: <a href=""https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/10140/62131"">1</a> <a href=""https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/8363/62131"">2</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently accidentally misclicked on an ""accept"" button (on my own solution, at that!), and got the Scholar badge, even though I've been arguing that accepting answers is a bad thing for the Code Golf site (basically because we expect every question to have multiple good answers, and accepting one makes other people feel like their contributions aren't wanted), and although I undid the accept as soon as I realised, the badge is now stuck there permanently, making me look somewhat hypocritical. (I guess I could delete and recreate my account; getting back to 20k rep might be fun. However, it would likely cause confusion as a result of all the disassociated posts, and I'm not keen on causing that much harm to the site.)</p>

<p>I can see several potential fixes to this problem: allowing users to opt out of receiving specific badges just like they can opt out of receiving Winter Bash hats; allowing users to recalculate their badges to remove ones that they no longer meet conditions for (thus allowing users to redeem themselves from, say, Peer Pressure or Scholar badges, although probably not Fanatic); or at least warning users before they do something that will gain a badge that they may not want. Do we need to do something to deal with this problem? If so, what should it be?</p>

many people browsing through <code>Newest</code> section would notice that my question has actually 2 answers already and may be tempted to not even read it anymore.</p>

"302311","Allow sites to choose whether comments should cost reputation in relation to how many visible comments by the same user on a post","<p>This is, possibly, a crazy idea, but I'm going to float it mostly just to see what happens. Please bear with me and read this through <em>before</em> voting.</p>

<p>Different sites have different community opinions regarding comments. Some are pretty easy-going, others are very strict. Some sites get lots of comments, some get very few.</p>

<p>However, even when the commenting culture is reasonably lax, a large number of comments can easily hide the relevant ones. Flagging and cleaning up after the fact (sometimes automatically, in response to the number and type of flags) is supposed to help with this, but it is mostly reactive.</p>

<p><strong>Suppose instead that each site could choose whether comments should be free</strong> once you've reached the reputation limit (the same way they are today), or <strong>whether comments should come at a small reputation cost.</strong> I'm thinking <strong>one rep point per previous, still visible, comment by the same user on the same post.</strong></p>

<p>So the first comment on any question or answer is free. If the same user wants to keep their first comment around, but post another, posting that second comment costs them 1 rep. A third comment with both of the previous ones visible would cost 2 rep, but if they delete the first one, the cost drops to 1 rep (because there's one comment by them visible on the post). The cost starts over from zero if they comment on an answer to that question on which they originally commented, or for that matter when they comment on a <em>different</em> answer. One might even consider upticks on the comment to refund the reputation cost, up to where the total cost for that comment becomes 0 rep, but that has the problem that people very often vote up witty comments that don't add much to the post, the posting of which is exactly what one might hope to discourage with this.</p>

<p>It doesn't even have to be exactly 1 rep per visible comment, but <em>more</em> than that would probably not be reasonable, and fractional rep points would likely complicate a lot of things plenty more than it's worth.</p>

<p>This would hopefully encourage commenters to clean up comments that are no longer necessary, and to restrict commenting to the temporary post-it notes comments are intended to be.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on this?</strong> I realize it'd take some developer time to actually make this happen, and that there are some things that would need to be worked out before the idea qualifies as an actual spec (for example, what happens when comments are deleted later?), but even those things notwithstanding, <strong>is it a good or a horrible idea, and why?</strong></p>

"303648","Can we change the minimum character restrictions on edit suggestions on the math sites?","<p>I think that we should do away with character limits on edits to Math Stack&nbsp;Exchange and MathOverflow. My main reason is that, in a mathematical post, a one-character error can cost a reader a significant amount of time and confusion, and I think this outweighs the amount of time it would take for these edits to be peer reviewed.</p>

<p>Also, in a math post, you cannot gauge the triviality or non-triviality of the edit by the number of characters, making the reputation-requirement for 6+ character edits quite arbitrary. This may be the case in some non-math areas as well, but I'm only venturing to address the parts of Stack&nbsp;Exchange that I use a lot personally.</p>

<p>In this context, we are not just talking about spelling corrections or adding a comma, or the like. Rather, an omitted negative sign (for instance), or other error in a symbol that indicates a more advanced concept, is often an obvious typo to one person, but very very confusing to another.</p>

<p>If I see something like that in a question pertaining to a topic that I specialize in, I am unable to change it, even though I know that people who do not specialize in the topic are going to see it and be misled by it. I think anyone who has studied math significantly can think of a time when a tiny typo in a book cost them a few days work. I think we should be able to rise above that obstacle via the technological advantage of interactive text.</p>

<p>There are even high ranking questions on this site about how to ""trick"" or work around the situation where your edit cannot be accepted for lack of sufficiently many characters, and people actually discuss methods for doing this. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of the rule, if there was in fact a good one in the first place.</p>

<p>You will also notice that the community tends to prefer, in other posts on this topic (via votes and selected answers), posts saying we should do away with the rule. This adds democratic support to my perspective, for what it's worth.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I am able to write the question in a good format on Stack Overflow or Code Review (posting some code how I do right now, and asking help), but this is a workaround to an existing problem. I just not sure why we should post questions which are related to programming in another community. </p>

"305965","Shouldn't there be an appeal process for (wrongly) rejected edits?","<p>I'll pose this one as a question for an open discussion because the issue really bothers me: </p>

<p>Shouldn't there be an appeal process for (wrongly) rejected edits?</p>

<p>First I have to give you some background for <strong>context</strong>: Almost all of my reputation score on SO comes from answering questions related to Bootstrap 4. Also, according to SO, I'm currently in the top 5% of folks who answer questions on that particular topic. In other words, I actually know a few things in regards to this particular topic. </p>

<p>Now, I have recently made an edit to an old question concerning this particular topic, Bootstrap 4 (i.e. my area of expertise). I'll link to that at the bottom because I want to keep the question and discussion general here. </p>

<p>My edit was rejected by 2 individuals who clearly have NO knowledge in regards to Bootstrap 4. But that's not even the most annoying part. The most annoying part are the justifications they have given for their rejection. Those justifications are completely and utterly 100% WRONG! </p>

<p>More context: </p>

<p>I <em>as a guy who is in the top 5% of folks answering Bootstrap 4 related questions</em> initially saw that old questions and didn't know what it actually meant (based on its title). So, I clicked the question because I wanted to find out what the asker actually meant. I then read the actual question. Nothing changed, the question was still unclear at that point. I then looked at the comments. And it was only then where I saw a clarification comment from the asker! </p>

<p>In the first comment to that question, someone asks: <code>What does ""multiple items carousel"" mean?</code> </p>

<p>That's exactly the question I would have asked because to me (someone who is in the top 5% answering Bootstrap 4 questions and actually KNOWS stuff about this subject) the asker's question was totally unclear. ""multiple items carousel"" is a term I have never heard before and at best this term/description is very ambiguous. Even to someone like me who is dealing with Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 4 related questions every single day. </p>

<p>It is, therefore, <strong>highly advisable</strong>, helpful and recommended to add the necessary clarification at least to the <strong>question's title</strong> and possibly also to the text of the question which is exactly what I did. </p>

<p>So, here are the issues I'd like to start a discussion about: </p>

<p>1) People reviewing edits often don't have any expertise on the topic at hand. </p>

<p>2) It seems that if a question has comments attached to it, those comments are NOT shown to the individuals reviewing the edits! WHY? Those comments were essential for a context in this case and would have shown even to someone who is inexperienced with Bootstrap 4 that my edit was in fact, relevant and correct. </p>

<p>3) There is no appeal process for cases of that nature. </p>

<p>So, my question is, once again: </p>

<p><strong>Shouldn't there be an appeal process for (wrongly) rejected edits?</strong></p>

<p>I'd like this to be an open, general discussion about this issue but for those mods who are interested to look up my particular case, it's my edit to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40393210/bootstrap-4-multiple-items-carousel"">this post here</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. 
I had promised to mods to never post anything on meta ever again but have now decided to make an exception for this issue because it really bothers me when someone accuses me of wrongdoings <strong>when it is objectively NOT the case</strong>.</p>

"306496","Show moderators which platform duplicate questions were asked from (mobile or desktop)","<p>When a user has multiple questions closed, the system sometimes notifies moderators, who might contact the user.  There is a template for mod messages that covers this case, so it seems we're supposed to (sometimes) send such messages.</p>

<p>A good duplicate helps the site, but a lazy duplicate, or one that is worded essentially the same as the original, is something we want to discourage. Fortunately, the system suggests possible duplicates as you're asking, so the user can avoid asking a clear dupe -- if he's using the full site.</p>

<p>Someone asking a question using the full desktop version of the website is shown a list of potential duplicates as they ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/mUDHZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mUDHZ.png"" alt=""""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, someone asking same question using the mobile version of the website is not shown possible duplicates.</p>

<p>Therefore, what platform a user asked a duplicate question on affects what a moderator should tell them, in case the moderator needs to contact them. If they used the desktop site and still repeatedly ask a poor duplicate, we want to point out that they should cut it out and how they can find previously asked questions before asking.  If they used their phone, we'd need to tailor that information to someone who doesn't have the list appear when he asks.  Knowing which platform was used also may affect, in some cases, how much good faith the moderator should ascribe to the asker.</p>

<p>It would be helpful, therefore, for moderators to be able to see what platform each closed-as-duplicate question was asked on. Ideally, this would appear in the multiple-closed-questions list, and perhaps also accessible from each question.</p>

<p>Now the association bonus does not allow people to downvote. So what they instead do is try to persuade others to downvote for them! Which means that the meta discussion under the post is now suddenly hijacked by people trying to argue the answer, often without any constructive criticism to the answer.  This is a bit annoying, I would be much more inclined to get downvotes at least that would send a more usable signal to others. But this may not work as many people are quite negative voting averse.</p>

<p>So my naive idea was that: could we change the rep needed somehow so that those coming from other networks could downvote once per site, so that we don't accumulate disagreements in the comments below the answers users don't like? Or something better could be suggested.</p>

<p>It's not like the accepted and voted answers writers can actually do anything about the voting result. So even if the author would agree that something else may be more deserving in the queue, they can't change the accepted status. Also, there can be many reasons not to do too much edit anyway, so as not to just post rationalize somebody else's more deserving answer. At least by allowing down voting, something would happen.

However, the Community user's edit list during a few days during early 2017 is cluttered with <em>thousands</em> of edits changing old links from HTTP to HTTPS.

<p>The main question: is there or should there be some waiting period for the original poster to review an edit before the edit gets approved?</p>

<p>If an edit is made to an answer, perhaps years after the original answer was posted, there is or was a <strong>timing window</strong> where the original poster starts receiving upvotes or downvotes on the edited answer before getting a chance to review the edit to see if the edit should be reverted or improved.</p>

<p>In the cases where the edit improved the answer, I don't see an issue, but if the edit degraded the answer, the degraded edit bumped the answer to the front page before the original poster had a chance to revert or improve the degrading edit.</p>

<p>As an example, one of my answers was degraded with the removal of a descriptive link which was a key part of that answer (explaining how name mangling is used in C++ to overload functions). I only noticed the edit due to a downvote, since the edit notification did not trigger an alert. I corrected the edit by restoring the descriptive link.</p>

<p>Suppose I notice that a bunch of existing questions are about a particular grammatical topic, but we didn't yet have an appropriate tag for that topic.  I have enough rep to create a tag, and I can go through the relevant questions and start adding the new tag; but I get hung up at the stage of creating the <em>synonym</em> in the other language.  In other words: suppose I create the new tag in Spanish.  I would also like to create a tag in English for that same topic, and I'd like to set up the synonym relationship.  This has always proved messy, largely because of the requirement to have a minimum score in that tag. </p>

"309514","Inclusion project - Emphasize Stack Exchange's culture of inclusion","<p>One of the more common defenses I've seen for rude/discriminating behavior is justifying it with multiculturalism.</p>

<p>I know that sounds odd on its face, so let me explain... </p>

<p>Users seem to be justifying behaving badly by claiming that it's the norm in their neck of the woods. Sometimes that's even accurate, but I suspect, more often than not, it's just a lame excuse. </p>

<p>Admittedly, some places seem to be ok with some kinds of discrimination, it's a sad fact of the world.  Some places have made a little more progress, and while that's great, they're still fighting to make it a little better... Stack Exchange seems to have become one of the latter places.</p>

<p>I'd prefer that Stack Exchange communities put their own culture first. As in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don't care where you come from, you still have to treat people like people here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems to be a corner stone of the Be Nice policy, at least as far as my reading of it. Although this can apparently be interpreted more than one way. </p>

<p>To flatly come out and say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not ok to treat X that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can be considered rude in some cultures, if you're going by the standard set by a given culture. How they feel about how X should be treated is culturally ingrained, often backed by eons of tradition, religion, and so on. This obviously creates a big stumbling block...</p>

<p>What I would like to suggest is plainly saying that Stack Exchange is a community with its own culture, and the norms and rules of our culture come first.</p>

<p>We don't want to offend users from any part of the world, from any religion, or culture, but when it comes to some things... Well...  That's just how we do it here. This is what <strong><em>our</em></strong> community feels is <strong><em>right</em></strong>.</p>

"309600","Have posts start at 3 upvotes","<p><strong>I suggest that new posts (questions and answers) should start at +3 votes by default</strong> rather than at 0.</p>

<p>This is meant to have no mechanical effect on the website. It is just a psychological display trick, with two effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Askers who have a question downvoted will not think <em>Wow, my question is so bad that it has negative value for this site</em>, and will be less discouraged. This is merely a psychological trick, but hey, haven't we all inconsciously been tricked sometimes, for instance by a price set as $9.99? I have had experience that, for instance, when setting the mark scale for an exam, it feels better for a student if their vote does not go into the negative; this can be achieved for instance setting values such as 1 point for a missing answer and 0 for a wrong one rather than 0 and -1.<br/> On SE, people sometimes feel the need to <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/256350/should-i-delete-my-question-if-it-got-negative-votes"">delete questions outright if they get a couple of downvotes</a>, which is not a good thing: maybe they can be salvaged, or they only contain a minor mistake by a new user. Or maybe that downvote comes from a grumpy user that randomly happened to be the first to see the post, and it will soon be cancelled by several upvotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Voters will think twice when they downvote a question from 1 to 0, or from 0 to -1: <em>is this question really that bad? Aren't those 2/3 downvotes enough to send a message that this question is not OK</em>? A question should be downvoted more than 2-3 times only if it is egregiously bad. On several SE sites long-time users exercise some restraint with downvotes already, but this trick would make it more natural.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another argument is that starting at 0 is not necessarily the correct thing: one could argue that there is at least one person who finds the question/answer useful, the poster, so it should start at 1. I believe Reddit posts start at 1, for instance.</p>

"310560","Can we get more recognition for canonical questions?","<p>I've only asked one <em>very broad</em> question (according to popular consensus, and I agree, though it seems to now get upvotes for some reason), and it is on Stack Overflow: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43255053/how-can-i-dynamically-create-and-execute-machine-code-at-runtime"">How could I generate and execute machine code at runtime?</a></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/203348/267500"">similar meta post</a> asking whether or not a particular set of questions is too broad references <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questions"">help/closed-questions</a>, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>too broad - if your question could be answered by an entire book, or has many valid answers (but no way to determine which - if any - are correct), then it is probably too broad for our format</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Please edit the question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer. Avoid asking multiple distinct questions at once. See the How to Ask page for help clarifying this question.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It is quite clear from this definition and the answer provided in the meta post linked above that being too broad is unacceptable here at Stack Exchange, however, it is not very clear as to what is or is not considered too broad, and I believe there may be questions that, although they fit this description of being <em>Too broad</em>, they do, however, have an answer that can work for other questions of the same nature. </p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25110510/why-doesnt-css-feature-work-in-browser-but-works-in-others?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">this canonical question</a> as a ""canonical duplicate"" for very similar CSS questions of the same format. It also makes it quite clear, with a disclaimer,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the canonical duplicate for all questions solvable completely by adding vendor prefixes. Stack Overflow questions should not be this broad unless discussed on meta and a canonical answer created thereafter like <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267634/what-to-do-with-css-prefix-questions"">this one was</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there exists a sufficiently broad question, but its answer and question are sufficient for all esoteric questions of the same nature, should not this format of questions be permissible for all Stack Exchange websites? I believe a change that better distinguishes and clearly defines what exactly a canonical question is and facilitates their creation and dissemination amongst non-canonical questions, or if that is not possible, an official clarification in the help section, would benefit the Stack Exchange community.</p>

<h1>Criteria</h1>

<p>I believe the best criteria for a question with this nature must answer yes to each the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>This question does not fall under the category of <em>too broad</em> as defined in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questions"">help/closed-questions</a> page, or the question <em>does fall</em> under this category, but has sufficient evidence to suggest or prove that this question can be answered comprehensively without extensive explanation and taking up no more than the length of a short to medium length article or blog post, i.e. can be answered with a short essay, but not a couple paragraphs.</li>
<li>This question has an answer that sufficiently answers every possible question for its specific category or sub-category.</li>
</ol>

<h1>In a Different Paradigm</h1>

<p>The <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/documentation"">Documentation trial</a> ended for various reasons, but these types of questions described here in this meta question are not the same, although they are similar in nature to how the Documentation questions work. They are different primarily in the sense that these questions are not intended to document a certain feature, nor does the nature of these questions intend to be ""as broad as possible for a specific subset of questions"", but are best defined as: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To describe, as <em>fundamentally as possible</em>, without ambiguity, the means of accomplishing a group of related problems or tasks that require the same process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is to my understanding that Stack Exchange, in general, expects questions to be as specific as possible; to answer specific problems in specific scenarios that others may come across as well, regardless of the obscurity of the problem. Considering how these ""<em>fundamentalist questions</em>"" are meant to solve a specific problem without being ambiguous, yet acting as the abstract template to concrete children of the same problem, I believe it may also be good to separate these problems from the problems that are currently common on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>I do not believe another Stack Exchange site is necessary for this, nor do I believe there needs to be a secondary site for every Stack Exchange just to separate these problems, but that these problems should be distinguished in some way and separated from the crowd, perhaps with a tag of some sort, with a description that says, when hovered: ""This question is intended to solve a specific category of very similar problems.""</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that, although the description for ""too broad"" states, ""has many valid answers (but no way to determine which - if any - are correct)"", answers are usually sorted by the community with the voting system anyways, though not always perfectly, which is often the case, or at least in terms of conflict between voting up because ""it is useful"" or voting up ""because this answers the question"". Often times, I see questions with answers that are accepted, but another highly upvoted answer directly answers the actual question, and in the comments you usually find, ""Why isn't this the accepted answer?"" or ""This should be the accepted answer because [it answers the actual question]"", and for the answer that is accepted: ""Why is this the accepted answer? This doesn't explain how to solve [X] problem because it expects [Y] when this answer only explains [A through X, and Z, but not Y]!""</p>

<p>One idea I have for this might be to have question hierarchies wherein this question has a list of specific questions that answer your specific question. Sortition of questions that are already related is accomplished by labels, and the aside already contains similar questions, but a link to a page containing a list of questions with the same nature as the problem at hand, but answering specific audiences, might be a good approach. A top navigation could also be added, in spite of this, showing a label hierarchy or question hierarchy, for example, in the pattern: </p>

<p>[language-or-technology] > [feature] {> [sub-feature(s)]} > [specific-problem]</p>

<h1>Potential Benefits</h1>

<ul>
<li>Such kinds of questions can help to eliminate questions that, although not considered duplicate questions, are questions with duplicate answers.</li>
<li>Can reduce the number of questions necessary to arrive at a single solution, for example, if a series of questions are required to be asked to solve a fundamental question that can be asked more easily, but might be considered too broad given the current guidelines for what is and what is not an acceptable question or answer.</li>
<li>Promotes higher quality answers and a greater number of answers. These kinds of fundamental problems can promote a greater number of answers because there are usually multiple approaches to a single question.</li>
<li>Relating to the previous bullet point, this provides questions that benefit a greater portion of the population for the problem at hand.</li>
<li>As mentioned in the summary, often the accepted answer is not the answer to the question, but answers a broader question beyond the scope, or somehow answers the question, but not as described by the question. If we allow questions of this nature, however, this will not be a problem, as anyone can state a procedure, and it can be verified (and sorted by the voting system).</li>
<li>The number of duplicates and low-quality questions is already a prevalent issue on the network. Allowing for more fundamental questions can eliminate duplicates and low-quality questions by providing a solution for a variety of cases that are the same or very similar.</li>
<li>Less search effort - since these questions will have a broader scope than just a specific feature, but can in fact cover a number of features, the questions linked from this question can be presented as solutions for a specific case, and this way, obscure and common answers and questions alike can be preserved and reach their appropriate audiences more effectively than they would have, as I often find myself searching through the search results quite a bit if I have a specific question, or a broader question that requires a different resource to find the answer.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Potential Drawbacks</h1>

<ul>
<li>A greater number of closed questions with the reason ""too-broad"" for the same reason that questions are commonly already being closed (failing to read and follow the Q&amp;A guidelines for making a question or answer; these kinds of questions ought to have their own guidelines to be very clear as to what is or is not ""too-broad"" or ""too-specific"" to be labeled as a ""fundamental-question""). Also due to what the community judges to be ""too-broad"" or ""too-specific"" (ah, the fault with democracy... tsk! Tsk!)</li>
<li>Too many answers - while having many answers, in this case, is a good thing, duplicate answers might be a new problem introduced by this sort of question, and even having too many answers. It might simply be that a certain answer is a duplicate of another answer that is worded differently, so you end up with a subtle duplicate. A problem shouldn't have an encyclopedia of solutions.</li>
<li>Inadequate answers - a question that isn't flagged or closed as ""too broad"" may have a few, or many, answers that do not adequately answer the question in question (heh heh) because the question may be borderline ambiguous yet specific. Such questions are more likely to have been missed by the community as needing to be flagged or closed, or need to be put on hold for further review, and common instructions (please correct the following identified errors...) to improve the question and get better results.</li>
<li>Greater moderation effort; the need for more moderators - this is a new type of question with its own rules and regulations. It needs its own team of moderators or existing moderators, though not necessarily a big problem. Adding anything to anything will obviously increase the workload and the required amount of time and effort to build and maintain a service.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, these questions are intended to solve non-esoteric questions that have canonical answers, or a solution to ""multiple questions, one answer"", that can exist alongside other questions and in current Stack Exchange sites without requiring extensive modification or development. This doesn't mean that existing, specific questions would be deleted, but simply referenced from the question. If examples are needed, I am glad to provide some in this post as real questions that would best fit this category, but would not be considered suitable for regular Stack Exchange. In one word: polychotomous.</p>

<p>Back to the original question then: what would be too broad a question for Stack Exchange? At what point does a question become too broad, and how might a canonical question be too broad?</p>

<p><em>To be clear: I am asking what the limits of specificity are for any given question on Stack Exchange. I am not asking about</em> how to make, answer, etc. <em>a canonical question.</em></p>

"311803","Should the ""can no longer be reproduced"" off-topic close reason on meta be changed?","<p>Here on Meta Stack Exchange as well as on Meta Stack Overflow, we have an off-topic close reason that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem described here <strong>can no longer be reproduced</strong>. Changes to the system or to the circumstances affecting the asker have rendered it obsolete. If you encounter a similar problem, please post a new question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This close reason was only supposed to be used for unresolved issues that are ephemeral or user-specific, or have to do with outdated features of Stack Exchange. In other words, it's a replacement for the old ""too localized"" close reason.</p>

<p>However, users seem to be using this on <em>every</em> solved bug report, especially since the wording implies it's OK to use it on such questions. However, that's not the intention of this close reason.</p>

<p>Thus, I think it should be changed. What should it be changed to? Please suggest. (In my answer below, I suggest splitting the close reason into two; feel free to make similar suggestions.)</p>

"311885","Why do we allow new users to comment on their own questions/answers?","<p>With the ongoing discussions about <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311737/lets-hold-language-in-comments-to-the-same-standard-as-posts"">commenting standards</a>, and about being <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"">welcoming in general</a>, a point I've seen raised a couple of times is the hostility and defensiveness that we sometimes see from new users.</p>
<p>They don't want to read the tour.  They don't want to be told the rules.  They don't want to hear why what they posted is off-topic based on meta discussion.</p>
<p>They just want the codez/answer/chatty discussion they were looking for.</p>
<p>This sometimes plays out in the following fashion:</p>
<ol>
<li>New user posts a bad question</li>
<li>Question receives downvotes</li>
<li>Experienced user attempts to help by leaving constructive comment telling new user what they should do differently to fix the question</li>
<li>New user posts frustrated, or perhaps even hostile comments that not only don't fix the question, but make experienced users feel attacked</li>
<li>More downvotes appear on the question</li>
<li>New user escalates complaints</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure how often this scenario plays out, but I've seen it more times than I can count.</p>
<p>Others have commented on the hostility from new users, as well.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a better use of time would be discouraging hostility from new users when they encounter enforcement of quality standards. There'd be a ton less snark if there was valid recourse against the new users who just don't care and want their question answered, quality be damned. As it stands, they have no skin in the game, so they're free to be as hostile and rude as they want. And all we can do is take it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your house has a sign outside that says &quot;Do not track mud in&quot;, because you want to keep it clean so that it's a nice environment for everyone who uses it; and someone walks in tracking mud, and you ask them if they read the sign, and they say &quot;Lol no didn't bother&quot;... are you not going to be in the slightest bit peeved?</p>
<p>Are you not, perhaps, going to respond to the rude mud-tracker with a somewhat snarky comment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I understand the privileges for comments, new users are able to comment on posts they &quot;own&quot;; i.e. the questions they ask, and any answers they create.  Once they get to 50 reputation, they can comment elsewhere.</p>
<p>Presumably, the benefit to allowing them to comment on their own posts is to provide clarification in response to requests for such from other users.  But if the new user does provide additional information, shouldn't that be edited into the question/answer?</p>
<p>Sure, new users may not realize that they can edit this way, but is giving them the ability to do it &quot;the wrong way&quot;, so that a more experienced user can take the information from their comment and edit it into their post for them, gaining us anything?</p>
<p>Why not just force them to edit the information directly into the question or answer themselves?</p>
<p>Are there any other benefits to allowing &lt;50 rep users to comment <strong>at all</strong>?</p>

<p>That question is not answered by <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28238/is-there-any-trace-of-my-closed-proposal"">Is there any trace of my closed proposal?</a>. I already went down the path in this other question, and the proposal was still closed because in the admin's opinion, U&amp;L SE already dealt with that. I don't know how long after that the proposal was deleted, but if others have made that proposal before or since, there is no way of knowing that, which makes resolving the issue more difficult. Additionally, when a proposal is deleted, all relevant questions about it on the Area 51 Discussions site are also automatically deleted.</p>

<p>I am going to make an argument of why I think it is being turned down due to the administrator not knowing about the domain much, and why placing the kind of questions that would belong on my proposed site on Unix and Linux, Super User, or Server Fault is not appropriate.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Linux is not UNIX, it is a Unix derivative</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Linux is a UNIX derivative, and most end users' questions relating to getting their desktops running properly are Linux questions. UNIX hardly features here. Consider the chart below, from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX</a>. Linux is one out of 13 operating systems belonging to the UNIX family. When one uses the word <code>unix</code> those older and little used Unices is what most people have in mind. <code>unix</code> generally means HP/UX, AIX, ATT, Solaris, SGI and a few other obsolete and hardy used Unices.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/93Nwi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/93Nwi.png"" alt=""Chart of UNIX History - Wikipedia""></a></p>

<p>The users of those systems are a minority working in specialized areas and they will also have specialist administrators to help with their problems. You won't see one of them coming here to ask about getting Wine or Steam to work on their systems. </p>

<p>Consider this table about Unix adoption with supercomputers from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption</a></p>

<pre><code>| OS         | Number | Share |    
|------------|--------|-------|    
| Linux      |    497 | 99.4% |    
| Other Unix |      3 |  0.6% |
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know that relevant numbers are with desktops, but I suspect they will be even less flattering with the <code>proper</code> Unices.</p>

<p>If most questions here are related to getting things to work on Linux, then the name of the site should be Linux and Unix Stack Exchange (with Linux mentioned first) and the domain name <code>linux.stackexchange.com</code>. A number of potential uses probably see UNIX in the domain mentioned first, and probably ignore it believing it is more UNIX focused.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>You can't mix end users' problems with administrators problems</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Even after this issue is sorted out, there is still separation between low level utilities and desktop related issues, something which I brought out in the comparison between Windows server administrators and Windows end users.</p>

<p>My issue is that the admins of Area 51 don't seem to grasp that you just can't lump end users who just want to get their stuff running and hopefully learn something extra with administrators who have even more complex issues to deal with and need more specialized knowledge.</p>

<p>Linux is an area where end users are forced to be administrators, but they only go so far and can't be lumped with proper server administrators, who are also sent to Server Fault and in some cases Super User as well. How does one judge if a Linux/UNIX administration question is better answered on Server Fault rather than Unix &amp; Linux? If they are better handled on Server Fault. then why U&amp;L, and why should end users go to U&amp;L rather than Super User if Ask Ubuntu has no interest in non-Ubuntu issues?</p>

<p>This is why the repeated response (I don't know how many times) that Unix and Linux SE covers the need for every thing Unix and Linux seems ill-thought out or understood.</p>

<p>Of course if you feel that the Unix/Linux debate belongs in U &amp; L Meta or Area51 that is fine, but the main question here is <strong>what should I do if I believe an Area 51 proposal was closed incorrectly or prematurely due to the administrator not knowing much about the domain in question?</strong></p>

"317009","What should be done here on Meta in case the close vote queue gets filled with questions?","<p>Currently, there are a lot of old SO-specific meta questions laying around on this site, asked back when this site used to accept them, before the MSO-MSE split. While many of these have been closed accordingly, quite a bit are still open, and I'll gladly vote to close one if pointed out to me.</p>

<p>On this site, users are limited to 24 close votes per day. (It was increased to 50 as a result of a big wave of off-topic questions; to be fair, I'm to blame for letting them know a long time later that they forgot to change it back and they did so per my request.)</p>

<p>Our Close Votes queue generally only gets 0-5 questions per day. This leaves people with the ability to vote to close other questions as they please without running into limits, and allows users to deal with things like blatantly off-topic questions, hammering duplicates, etc. There are generally only a few users (~10-20) who do that on a daily basis on this site.</p>

<p>But occasionally, the close votes queue gets filled up with dozens of these old SO-specific questions. Users without enough rep to vote to close can flag questions for closure, and if they have a <em>long</em> history of good flagging, they can add <em>up to 100</em> questions to the queue per day. On this site, I had raised 400 helpful flags, mostly recommend closure flags, enabling me to cast 50 flags a day, before I gained enough rep to vote to close. On Stack Overflow and Super User, I can cast 100 flags per day despite not having enough rep to vote to close.</p>

<p>As I said, I don't disagree with those flags; I think it's great that the user(s) who is/are flagging those questions is bringing them up to our attention, so that they can be closed. But the daily close vote limit can leave us few users who deal with them daily with very little power, after we've spent some time handling those review tasks. After taking care of the queue yesterday, I came across two blatantly off-topic questions that I was unable to vote to close, and judging from the low amount of close votes after some time (they generally get closed very quickly), I guess many others also had the same problem.</p>

<p>What should be done about this? Should users without closing privileges be limited to casting 24 recommend closure flags per day, limiting them to adding only the same amount of questions that a 3k+ user can add to the Close Votes queue? Should we raise the daily close vote limit to 50 on this site? Some more complicated solutions are to increase the daily close vote limit in case the queue gets filled above a certain threshold on a given day, or to make close votes cast through review not affect the daily close vote allowance. (These seem like generalized solutions to localized problems, since this issue reported here is specific to MSE.)</p>

<p>Also, another thing: if the queue size goes over 150, the daily review limit gets increased to 40. This can happen if 2-3 users with great flagging histories flag a bunch of these old questions. But that doesn't make mathematical sense if I can only vote to close 24 of them, and that can leave my close votes altogether depleted.</p>

<p>To be clear, the issue at hand here is about users who vote or flag <em>many</em> of those old questions that don't have an <em>immediate need</em> to be closed, and are very likely doing so in the name of cleanup, per Nathan's answer below.</p>

<p><strong>For now, I'm going to tap Leave Open on old SO-specific questions that have no close votes and have no recent activity; others please join me in doing the same so that flags get declined and the user(s) who floods the queue will get the message.</strong></p>

"317024","What is the views:upvotes ratio for clickbait?","<p>In response to the recent <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/316934/revisiting-the-hot-network-questions-feature-what-are-our-shared-goals-for-ha"">problems with the HNQ</a>, I think we need to rethink how the Hot Network Questions are ranked. As @E.P. pointed out, in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/316961/400527"">their answer</a>, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, problem with the list is that it is filled with clickbait.</p>

<p>Featuring clickbait on the HNQ just attracts new users that enjoy clickbait. These shouldn't be the people we are trying to attract. We want users that actually care about the site and will uphold the quality standards. This goes along with what @NicolBolas said in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/316966/400527"">their answer</a>. Showing clickbait just makes other users think using clickbait to get upvotes and views is OK.</p>

<p>What we really need to do is sort out which questions are clickbait and which aren't. That way we get good questions that encourage people to join the site and leave an insightful, helpful answer, instead of getting people who take a look at it and then leave or join just to post a spam answer. The kinds of questions that should be on the HNQ should be in need of answers, with a sufficient number of answers having a high score.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, click-bait-y answers get a lot of upvotes by virtue of having more views from more people clicking it, so votes is not an accurate indicator of whether the question is a good one (non-clickbait). The best way to tell whether the answer is clickbait might be based on the proportion of upvotes to views.</p>

<p>To combat clickbait, we should explore the possibility of a views:upvotes ratio to determine if a question is a good one. It would be simple enough to implement because it uses metrics we already have without needing checking for clickbait keywords.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>What is the ratio of views:upvotes in popular clickbait questions compared to the ratio for a non-clickbait popular questions? Popular meaning these questions meet the objectives for a HNQ. These proportions will be important in determining the relationship between the two metrics, and will tell us if it is possible to determine what is and isn't clickbait.</p>

<p>This question asks for a ratio backed up by hard evidence. Please do not provide ""Well I guess X because Y"" answers. I know the answer will be a little subjective based on how you define clickbait, and it may require some digging and searching, but I think the results will still be accurate enough to be of use.</p>

<p><strong>If you don't agree with this question</strong></p>

<p>A lot if users have pointed out that, in their opinion, cickbait is not an issue with the HNQ, or that the views:upvotes ratio won't be helpful. Thank you for the feedback, but I am not asking about feasibility here.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question, I do not want to argue about whether this metric will be helpful/accurate. If you think there is a problem with gathering the data I described, I am open to that. If you think the HNQ has a different problem, please discuss this on the HNQ post I linked to. Please do not complain about this question because you think the metric will be unhelpful. Also try to think about that if you are planning on downvoting or VTC-ing. All I am asking for is this ratio, my analysis of the HNQ issues is only provided as a background for the question.</p>

<p>If you are downvoting, it would help if you could please leave an explanation of why in the comments so I can improve this post. I have tried to edit this post multiple times, but it seems that there is still a problem.</p>

Are these really good practices?","<p>I asked <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/402639/mbnm-measuringbynotmeasuring-thought-experiment-is-this-wrong-if-so-how"">this</a> question which I later learned was apparently preposterous and was heavily downvoted.</p>
<p>I was still positive that someone will one day come across my question who will be generous and patient enough to look through my question and help me understand it better.</p>
<p>So a few days ago I wanted to check the status of the question, but to my surprise, I did not find it in my list of asked questions. And then I looked through my &quot;all actions&quot; tab and &quot;reputation&quot; tab entries. <em>Nowhere!!</em></p>
<p>After like 30 mins of search, fortunately, I found an old conversation of mine, in a chat room, where I had mentioned the link to my question, So I was able to retrieve the question. And it said to undelete the question it required votes.</p>
<p><strong>How are the upvotes from others are possible if you hide the question from everyone?</strong></p>
<p>So I commented the link to this question, on my other questions requesting users to analyze it and <strong>upvote for the undeletion</strong> if they found it right. But then I get a private  message from moderators, that such commenting is not in line with the spirit of the website and I should instead ask in meta site or a chat room, which I found completely justified, so I messaged them back apologizing and told them that I would delete the comments that I posted on my questions requesting the undeletion and I go onto delete the comments, again to my surprise all of my comments are <strong>deleted without my permission.</strong></p>
<p>I find this totally wrong on so many levels.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, we already have the privilege of downvoting the question. If we find someone's question to be inappropriate we can downvote it vehemently, but we should not have the privilege of deleting the question for who knows, after some time there may come new visitors who will upvote the question more, so by deleting it you are preventing the self-correcting mechanism of society. By deleting a question you are removing a data sample from the public access and I believe it is a violent invasion of freedom of speech. And the reason that is given is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abandoned, unanswered questions can be a nuisance for readers when
they appear in search results. While every question deserves a chance
to be answered, at some point the annoyance to those searching for a
solution outweighs the increasingly small chance that an answer will
be provided.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Community user will automatically delete old
abandoned / dead questions in the following circumstances:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;at some point the annoyance to those searching for a solution outweighs the increasingly small chance that an answer will be provided&quot;. This is dangerous as this chooses <strong>practicality over truth</strong>. That is not how science works, we will have to examine extremely annoying ideas and take on ordeals, to come to the truth of reality. <strong>Instead of deleting the question, question with high downvotes can be shown in the end, therefore fixing nuisance problem.</strong> And people who are searching the answer will notice the downvotes and will not engage in that question. Why don't we let people decide for themselves? Rather than saying here is a question, which many people think is bad, see if you want to spend time on it, it is objectively worse to hide that question from the &quot;those searching for a solution&quot;. A question is not an atomic statement. The question and its description can layout an unprecedented way of thinking which can bring forth valuable insights. By deleting the question all this organic nuanced dynamic is thrown out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, even though we can delete the question, why are we removing every reference of the question, almost obsessively, from the website. In my personal profile, the question is deleted from my list of asked questions. How can we do it? Not just that, every reference of the question, from &quot;all actions&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot; entries is also erased? This was absolutely unnecessary, if I did not have the link to my own question somehow, I would have lost my question, I could have had some potentially valuable information or insight into that question. This is absolutely not acceptable, as this is almost equivalent to the destruction of my private data and infringement of my privacy and my access to my own data.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, I can't ask any question, because if I try to ask a question it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You have reached your question limit Sorry, we are no longer
accepting questions from this account. See the Help Center to learn
more.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? If we think that someone is not contributing to the community, we can take away that person's reputation. It is one of the purpose of reputation. But we simply cannot excommunicate the user. It seems to be a redundant functionality. And it's also not very effective, because all that someone needs to do is create a new account and start asking questions. This does not fix anything. Instead if we feel like someone is not genuine we can take the reputation off or make his/her reputation negative.  So that particular person will obviously be neglected. And if some one spams with like 100 questions, I think we already have a system that you cannot ask more than one question in a fixed window time period. And lets say if a person just goes on asking gibberish, there should an upper-limit of questions for given reputation-downvote based history of previously asked questions. This is way better solution as compared to ban someone who has asked like 10 questions in my case.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong> I agree there should be some measures to ensure the ease and quality of the website. And we do have such measures like downvoting, flagging, reputation loss. But I argue that deleting someone's question, and also banning that person from asking questions and obsessively removing references of the question thereby effectively taking away the access to the question, even to the person who asked it, is a blatant invasion of privacy and a violation of freedom of speech. A conflation of moderation with censoring. And a set of redundant unnecessary features which are arguably not the best practices in the field of Science, where truth is of the highest value.</p>
<p>I predict that this question will be met with rigorous downvoting, will be put on hold as off-topic or opinion-based, and in a couple of days closed and in a week or a month deleted and wiped clean from the face of this website. <strong>And then someone writes a blog on why stack exchange is hostile to newcomers. Seriously?</strong></p>
<p>And I also speculate if <strong>Einstein</strong> was to be born in this day and age and asks something which is non-populistic, he will not be discussed with, instead his questions will be downvoted, he will be banned from asking questions, his questions will be wiped clean by the &quot;routine&quot; in turn operated by &quot;moderators&quot;. This is not Science, this is online-mob-censoring.</p>
<p>P.S: Please do not confuse this with me blaming moderators and SE users. I am aware that deletion and banning happens automatically by present routine. And that is exactly what I am talking against here. This is me trying to point out that the present rules which guide the routine as of now, allow for blatant invasion of freedom of speech and privacy.</p>

"323557","Automatically move comments to chat if the author already posted a few comments on the same post","<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Force comments to chat if the author already posted <em>n</em> comments or is replying to such a comment.
This should considerably reduce moderation load of long comment threads.</p>

<h3>Proposal</h3>

<p>Automatically force comments to chat in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Somebody who is not the post’s author and who has already posted <em>n</em> comments on the post makes another comment.
This shall include any deleted comments, except self-deleted comments or comments that were flagged obsolete and deleted (presuming a separate obsolete flag).
Exclude any comments made from review or by diamond moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>Somebody posts a comment that @-pings a user to whom the above criteria apply (has already posted <em>n</em> comments on this post; not the post’s author). This includes if the new comment’s author is the post’s author.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With <em>forcing to chat,</em> I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of the intended comment, leave a comment by the Community user indicating that the discussion has been moved to chat. If the new comment contains an @-ping, let the community user use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not tell the user that their comments would be moved to chat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy</strong> all existing, undeleted comments to chat (except those by Community).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Move</strong> the new comment to chat. If it’s heuristically part of a multi-part comment, move the other parts as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the new chatroom the target for all further comments moved from the post (be it by the proposed mechanism or moderators).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not block comments</strong> that do not match the above criteria.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>One of the reasons why we move comments to chat is to make room for (existing or future) relevant comments that would otherwise get buried under irrelevant ones or long discussions that hardly anybody is willing to read.
Separating the wheat from the chaff here is very tedious for moderators and one of the major sources of disputes when moving to chat.
Therefore it would be helpful to partially automatise this:
Moderators waste time on this, are inevitably slightly biased, and are perceived as strongly biased by some users.</p>

<p>Now, the above certainly doesn’t completely automatise everything, but it should apply to quite a lot of cases and have a low number of false positives, i.e., relevant comments forced to chat.
If a user has something relevant to comment, they will almost certainly do it in their first few comments.
Later comments are very likely to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>part of a back and forth (a.k.a. discussion) that has a good chance of continuing for quite some time,</li>
<li>answers in comments, be it as comments on a question or opposing another answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intensive back-and-forths often start with relevant comments and slowly degrade in quality over time, which makes it difficult to draw the line of the last comment that is not moved to chat.
Since every party in the discussion want to be the one to have this last word, this is also a source of disputes.
Therefore having an automated decision here is particularly valuable to moderation.</p>

<h3>Tuning the Criteria</h3>

<p>I would suggest <em>n</em> = 3 for most sites for now (on metas, it should probably be higher).
One might consider adding a criterion of a minimum number of comments on the post.</p>

<p>With some data crunching, it should be easy to find a good value for the parameters:
Just look at all cases where moderators moved comments to chat, deleting most, but leaving at least one standing (or undeleted shortly afterwards).
Then determine how many of these comments would have been caught by the proposed criteria depending on the parameters.</p>

<h3>Potential Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>All of this is written mostly based on my experience from moderating a comment-heavy site (Academia). It may not translate well to some sites, though I don’t see why. Anyway, I am aware that long comment discussions are hardly an issue on many sites.</p></li>
<li><p>“Doesn’t this kill even more discussions?” – Please see my answer <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/323328/255554"">here</a>.
Briefly: I am not sure whether killing discussions by moving to chat is a “bug”.
Moreover, it may even be that moving discussions to chat earlier is beneficial to their continuation.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be possible for users to exploit the mechanisms to intentionally get the last word in a discussion, by intentionally not pinging their opponent.
However, this is already possible to some extent today: If you do not ping your opponent, there is a considerable chance that they never look at the comment thread in question again and thus do not respond.</p></li>

After questioning whether there was a real consensus about this issue, I got the following ironical response from ""Bhargav Rao"": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a consensus meeting held yesterday in the mod room just to
  make sure that the moderators on Stack Overflow agreed with what
  DavidG said. We authorized Cody Gray to be our representative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the point of the argument (whether anyone's point is right or wrong) is irrelevant, but the fact that 2 moderators intervened, where the first one claiming that all other moderators agreed with what one person said, and the second one stating that they met the day before said person commented and agreed that they will agree with his comment (that was not yet written), and authorizing ""Cody Gray"" to be their representative, indicates a level of non-professionalism that SO is sinking into. It seems that some SO moderators are not taking their mandate seriously.</p>

<p>My question is: Should such behavior be tolerated on SO? And if it's not, how do moderators address such situations where one moderator acts unprofessionally (who will moderate moderators? If it tolerated, then what is the limit? I understand that everyone wants to be ""funny"" from time to time and make other people laugh, but this is a professional site, and, IMHO, moderators should set an example.</p>

<p>The conversation is presented here, but exists currently in the comments section on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/election/11?tab=nomination#post-55017097"">rptwsthi's nomination</a>:</p>

"325745","Why shouldn't existing answers that don't match the typical pattern of good answers be skimmed only?","<p>I understand generally one should read existing answers before giving another one. This can avoid duplicated answer, add more votes to them, and even when the existing answers miss your point, they can still provide useful information that you can use in your answer. However, is there a case that it is acceptable to not doing that, especially on questions about research/theory/concept?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/21404/86"">this example answer</a>, after skimming the existing answers, I don't see how it matches the typical answer for this kind of question. Usually the very first sentence of the answer will point you to the concepts with links, in an affirmative tone, and rest of it just elaborate it more. On the other hands, answers that are just speculations from the answerer can't start with that tone, and however it tries to be concrete it cannot touch on the very core of the problem. This is the pattern I see in all of the existing answers.</p>

<p>What I mean is that, although technically you don't know without actually reading it, it is not worth to know either. There is a difference between not wanting to do homework because you want others do it for you, and not doing it because you have something more efficient to do than doing homework. The phenomenon that without giving the correct concept at the very beginning the reader will be confused is called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4HHCgFmkcI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">schema</a>. I think Buddhism also describes it as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_proliferation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conceptual proliferation</a>.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that reading them wouldn't help me write a better one, and I think you can actually know where it goes without reading them. Even if they have information that is useful or duplicate to my answer, that information usually should be rewritten completely, so it's hardly called as duplication. </p>

<p>Is this a good reason to not reading existing answers before giving your own?</p>

"326725","Moderators’ behavior in small Stack Exchange communities","<p>Lately I have been visiting some Stack Exchange sites like Italian Language and similar, and I saw a lot of people (moderators included) tend to comment chatty things like “Welcome to ...”. I know it’s friendly, nice and whatever, but isn’t it against the rules? When I first registered on Stack Exchange, I only used Stack Overflow and I always got downvoted/had my questions closed/etc., for less important things.</p>

<p>Plus, they even ask/answer weird things that on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com"">more serious websites</a> don’t exist (if not for just a few minutes) or, if they do, they get downvoted.</p>

<p>There they even get upvoted by a few people (probably just because the ones asking them have a lot of reputation or something) and it’s really confusing seeing this kind of difference between those websites. I love Stack Exchange because, unlike all other Q&amp;A websites, it is constantly being controlled, so you only find quality content; but I think those uncontrolled (or controlled by a few people) communities tend to ruin this brilliant web site.</p>

<p>So my main question is: why do moderators, the ones that more than anybody else should know how to use this website, make such errors?</p>

"327125","When a comment doesn't contravene the CoC but gets deleted all the same","<p>I often delete my own comments when there are typos, when they might be interpreted in the wrong way, or their wording needs improvement. I also do my utmost to delete comments that are no longer needed, so I am not a ""comment whore"" (I think ""whore"" is an expression popular in the US for people who crave attention at all costs. If someone is offended by the term, apologies, a more effective expression does not spring to mind.) Yet, on several occasions on Meta, I find perfectly harmless comments of mine are deleted when I return to visit a page. </p>

<p>A  now-deleted comment of mine on this <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/327018/stack-overflow-has-engaged-in-ideological-censorship-and-unwelcoming-behavior"">post</a> attracted a couple of upvotes, I didn't keep count, yet it was deleted for it being ""chatty"". It was not the only victim of the culling. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
The comment which was deleted was, I felt, useful, it was not idle chatter. It was useful to point out that the incriminating post was invisible for users like myself who do not have 10K on Stack Overflow, it was complimenting the OP on the amount of care and attention they spent in composing the question and at the same time reminding users that a post so well thought out and argued takes considerable time. Then there was something else, but I've completely forgotten what it was, too bad, I suppose. If ever there was a more conciliatory comment then that was it.</p>

<p>On a closely related issue,  anything can be interpreted in the wrong light by one or more users, this inevitably leads to prejudicial treatment, and that risk increases  when the person commenting is a non-native speaker.  A number of non-native users' posts and comments are weak on nuance, tone and ‘diplomacy’, and some languages adopt a more direct, perhaps brusque, approach than the pleasantries the English language employs. <strong>This missing tone can make or break a post or a comment.</strong> </p>

<p>Here is one such <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/327041/4"">question</a> which I recently edited because the downvotes seemed to be a knee-jerk reaction to the OP's original title. After the not insignificant edit, the upvotes started to arrive. </p>

<p>Mods and CMs alike should always be fair, even towards users they may personally dislike or find particularly annoying, and recent events have led me to believe that I fit into that category. I have been warned of misusing comments and the veiled threat of suspension has been used as a stick to dissuade me from actively participating. This sounds like sour grapes, doesn't it? It's not. My reaction on finding that a comment (which did not violate CoC and was not off-topic) of mine was yet again deleted is of stunned disbelief. </p>

<p>I thought comments on Meta were viewed differently from those on the main site. I found the following <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/270427/when-should-comments-be-flagged-deleted-on-per-site-metas"">topic</a>, posted in 2015 by a highly respected mod on  a number of  SE sites and very recently also appointed as a mod on Meta.   </p>

<p>[Emphasis in bold mine]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all know what comments are for -- and aren't, but that guidance is, naturally, geared toward main sites, where we want to keep things clean and focused. Meta, on the other hand, is a site's ""second place"", with some different rules and conventions. For example, questions on main sites can be closed as primarily-opinion-based, <strong>but meta is all about opinions. There's a ""discussion"" tag and such questions collect many opinions. Meta is different.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OP of <em>Stack Overflow has engaged in ideological censorship and unwelcoming behavior</em> also expressed perplexity on the deletion of several comments beneath their post. The mod who undertook this action, replied 
 [Emphasis in bold mine]     </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anything that provided context, potential clarifications/requests that didn't feel like they'd fit into an answer that was on topic but were useful or talked about possible reasons to close (since they are automatic)- and a few more that felt like they wouldn't be answers. I <em>could</em> have purged them all, and it was tempting, but if you're going to argue out points in comments, that's not what they are there for. <strong>And now, I'll be doing a second round of cleanups</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, they added this further explanation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, We'll be rather agressively pruning the comments here. Its not social commentary, just housekeeping - <strong>but feel free to post any substancial information that's of interest on this topic as a <em>post</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I 100% disagree, it is still social commentary. Only the comments agreeing with the deletion of the answer were allowed to stand. How is that not social commentary?</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that it is impossible to post an answer on a question that has been placed on hold, so that comment was poorly thought out. It happens. </p>

<p>Henceforth–<em>lovely word</em>–I shall be taking screenshots of every comment I post on MSE, especially those which express disagreement with a decision undertaken by the team and <em>do not</em> violate the CoC. The two can be achieved.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems to me that the arbitrary deletion of comments follows no fixed criteria.</p>

"327876","When there is a mismatch between the question title and question content - is an answer off-topic?","<p>I am addressing the situation when there is a mismatch between what the question title asks for, and what the question body asks for. Given the mismatch, any answer can address either the title or the body, not both, so there is possibility to be marked as off-topic in either case.</p>
<p>I have read <em><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/178762/what-to-do-with-overly-general-question-titles-on-specific-questions"">What to do with overly general question titles on specific questions</a></em>, and I noticed that a new title can be suggested, but let's suppose an answer is already provided, and is flagged as off-topic. How is this resolved?</p>
<p>Let's take the concrete example of <em><a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/37177/how-to-explain-intravenous-drug-abuse-to-a-6-year-old"">How to explain intravenous drug abuse to a 6-year-old?</a></em>. While the <em>title</em> asks for an explanation about the <strong>drug usage</strong>, the <em>body of the question</em> is rather asking for how to explain the <strong>presence of needles on a playground</strong>, and <strong>why a child should stay away from touching needles</strong> (or at least that is my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong). Key phrases that highlight the intent of the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I couldn't explain was why the syringes and needles were there</p>
<p>I almost went ahead and explained intravenous drug use (proves that drug discussion is a sub-topic)</p>
<p>I've also explained that neither needles nor syringes must be touched because they carry infection. (parent is worried about child safety, not about explaining drug use)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a mismatch between what is intended in the title, and what is intended in the body of the question. While the drug-discussion and the needle-discussion aren't necessarily unrelated, I feel that the drug-discussion <strong>is a sub-topic (therefore not mandatory to be addressed in an answer)</strong> of the main topic, which is about explaining needles presence on a playground AND effectively keeping a child away from touching needles.</p>

"331108","Would a positive approach to question validation help with the friendliness/quality divide?","<h1>Friendliness/Quality Divide</h1>
<p>OK, that question probably does not make a lot of sense on its own, so let me at least explain the last part. With &quot;friendliness/quality divide&quot; I mean the currently apparently opposing goals of being welcoming to newcomers vs. maintaining a high quality standard in questions. There's been <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/18/building-community-inclusivity-stack-overflow/?cb=1"">a post in the SO blog about this</a> that illustrates the issue well.</p>
<h1>The Negative Approach</h1>
<p>Maintaining a high quality standard is achieved - more or less - by rejecting bad (often just &quot;not yet good&quot;) quality questions. However, this currently works in a <strong>negative</strong> way: A question is posted in all its glory, and at that point it's a &quot;complete&quot; question; people can see and answer it.</p>
<p>Then another user comes along and says why it's not good enough. We can sugarcoat it as much as we want, ultimately the message is &quot;your question sucks because X&quot;. It might very well be closed for that reason. At that point that feels more like <em>demoting a question that was already there</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Your question sucks because you didn't do the research&quot;, &quot;Your question sucks because you don't have a verifiable example&quot;, you all know these reasons. They are <em>valid</em> reasons and changing those is not the solution to this problem. IMHO, a user (and often a high-rep on, at that) telling another user &quot;what you did sucks&quot; is  what causes friction.</p>
<h1>The Positive Approach</h1>
<p>I imagine a &quot;positive&quot; approach as one where a question starts out as a &quot;prototype&quot; (or however you want to call it). The point is, it's not yet ready, not yet a &quot;complete&quot; question - and there's a checklist of steps that have to be verified in order for it to get <em>promoted</em> to a &quot;complete&quot; question. A &quot;complete&quot; question can then be answered.</p>
<p>We already have <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask"">a &quot;quality checklist&quot;</a>. These could be &quot;checked&quot; by other users. Imagine a question where it's unclear what they are asking. A user might see this feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>appropriate amount of research - YES</li>
<li>has a verifiable example - NO, BUT DOES NOT NEED ONE</li>
<li>has a clear, answerable question - (no votes)</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Your question sucks because X&quot; becomes &quot;Just do X and you're there!&quot; - but most importantly, quality isn't sacrificed to achieve that.</p>
<p>I also don't see any issue with letting somebody who checked these boxes answer the question. It seems that this way, it's not really less convenient to answer a question - it might even be an improvement.</p>
<h1>In conclusion</h1>
<p>Obviously, this is not a 100% worked out system yet, but I see a potential to reconcile friendliness and quality without sacrificing parts of either. Of course, I might be forgetting things. For example, I didn't go into the technical side at all.</p>

<p>Duplicate on-topic questions <strong>whose titles differ substantially from the original</strong> should be preserved even if no answer is posted. Why? Because it will stop future duplicates. How? 1. It will appear in the similar questions window. 
For example,    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/sbYG3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/sbYG3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the first result is quite helpful, if nothing else its title tells me that my question has been asked before. It is not the official response, but I'll be motivated to read that post.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Downvoting an <strong>unanswered duplicate</strong> post whose title is significantly unique, means condemning it to deletion. </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>On MSE there are hundreds of duplicate questions with <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?page=672&amp;tab=Votes&amp;q=duplicate%3Ayes"">scores lower than -20</a> and yet they will never be deleted by the system because they have  one or more upvoted answers.  See the screenshot above for an example. </p>

<p>In fact, here is the <em>first</em> similar question that the system provided in the box:<br>
 <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/81925/why-dont-add-a-comment-when-downvoting"">why don&#39;t add a comment when downvoting?</a>. It has a score of -8 but as it has an upvoted answer, the question will not be deleted. Did it stop me from posting a very similar = identical question? <strong>Yes, it did!</strong>. Of course we are all aware that AI is not infallible, and some users will stubbornly ignore the list of similar questions but <em>not</em> everyone. Some users will find their answer and either not post a dupe or come up with ways to argue why the official response does not answer their query, which in turn will make the question more useful and helpful.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST  </p>

<p>Back in September 2014, the following was posted:
<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/238858/turn-off-the-roomba-for-child-meta-sites"">Turn off the roomba for child meta sites</a>.
 The accepted and only answer posted, explained why this was not such a great request </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a seemingly-endless number of bad ideas; we don't really need to archive them.</p>
  
  <p>Of course... If someone writes up a really good explanation for why an idea is bad, that can be worth keeping around.</p>
  
  <p><em><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/244733/223820"">So if you see a meta question you don't want lost, write a good answer to it.</a></em><br>
  @shog9 ( Dec 5 '14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue there is <em>one</em> exception that should be made. <strong>Unanswered questions that are duplicates</strong>. </p>

<p>It's my understanding that these posts can be deleted even when the correct <em>answer</em> supplied  is closing it as a duplicate of an older, usually highly upvoted, question. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Note that abandoned questions that are duplicate targets are still subject to automatic deletion by the Community user if any of the criteria apply.) <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/10844/32"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's an advantage in protecting dupes from deletion when their titles are significantly different from the older question. Take for example the recently closed question </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>""Could someone help me understand why I can't post on Stack Overflow?""</strong>   </li>
</ol>

<p>The title above is <em>vastly</em> different from the original older post, which is the site's official response. Yesterday, if you typed the key words <strong><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=why%20%22can%27t%20I%20post%22"">why ""can't I post""</strong></a> using the site's search box, you would not have found the original question. </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>""<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86997/what-can-i-do-when-getting-we-are-no-longer-accepting-questions-answers-from-th"">What can I do when getting “We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account</a>”?""</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p>Nonetheless, it's easy to see why veteran users would downvote the former; the request has been asked many times before, the OP doesn't seem to have done any research, and the original probably shows up in the sidebar. However, downvoting a duplicate into oblivion is detrimental to the health of the entire network for two main reasons. </p>

<p>First, it leaves a nasty impression of the community. It suggests that its most valuable members hold a painfully low opinion of the querent (<em>""..., reposts of the same question by the same user? Sure, why not. Punish the wicked, I say.""</em> as one user said).  It informs the OP that experienced users view them as time wasters and/or slackers, if not worse. Secondly,  but equally as important, protecting  a dupe from deletion  will stop future duplicates.  </p>

<h2>In Defense of Dupes</h2>

</ul>

<h2>When should a duplicate be deleted?</h2>

<p>There is a duplicate post with a score of -80. Objectively, it is a hugely unpopular Feature Request, it has been soundly rejected by the community. It survives by virtue of it receiving five answers. Let's compare its title with the older canonical title. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Badges for trolling/ridiculous behavior [duplicate]</strong> (-80)</li>
<li><strong>temporal Anti-badges with negative side effects to discourage bad behaviour</strong> (-16)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only significant term that the duplicate question has over the original is ""trolling"" other than that it is a perfect duplicate. </p>

<ul>
<li>I propose that <strong>heavily downvoted</strong> questions or requests with almost IDENTICAL titles to that of older posts should continue to be closed as duplicates and <em>then</em> deleted. If there are any answers posted, these can be migrated to the older question. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Clarification</h2>

<p>Comments below have alerted me that some users believe this request is extended to every site on the network. It could well do, but initially I was <em>thinking</em> of child meta sites and in particular,  MSE (Meta), hence that first link. Apologies for any possible confusion created.</p>

<p>Should Stack Exchange staff be allowed to vote in any of the: community elections, meta Q&amp;A, base site Q&amp;A?</p>

<p>Should Stack Exchange staff get to alter what is shown and not shown in any of the: community elections, meta Q&amp;A, base site Q&amp;A? This can be either by altering what is visible in the question tabs, or by altering user permissions.</p>

<p>Finally, should Stack Exchange staff get to alter pages on a specific Stack Exchange site, thereby altering the rules by which they follow?</p>

<p>Note that all of the questions above assume that not the community nor the moderators have given consent to said actions.</p>

<p>As per request of  πάντα ῥεῖ:</p>

<p>One may compare the legitimacy of staff voting in community elections to the US Federal government having a say in state and local elections.  This is not something that is wanted by the United States themselves, nor the federal government.</p>

<p>The same analogue follows with Meta Q&amp;A: Why should one person in the US west coast be telling another person in the east coast how to live? That's not a community. That not what Stack Exchange claims to praise.</p>

<p>Altering what is shown is also a big no-no, and the reasons for this should be obvious. Why should some be hard and others silenced? Obviously, that's a be- all end all. On a smaller scale, things like shadow edits have been enacted on posts which don't show up in edit history, once again removing the power of the users.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a single language related site and use tags when asking questions about a specific language. Stack Overflow already does something similar for programming languages.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic support for minority or endangered languages.</strong> There are thousands of languages that will never have enough support to create their own SE site. Yet many have a core group of learners and researchers that would benefit from being able to ask and answer questions just by adding a new tag. </li>
<li><strong>Cross-language questions.</strong> Many languages are related to each other. A common site would make it easy to ask a question about something that covers two languages. Just add both language tags.</li>
<li><strong>Cut down on the proliferation of new SE sites.</strong> I don't know that having lots of sites is necessarily bad, but sometimes less is more.</li>
<li><strong>Better search engine results.</strong> I can't guarantee this one, but it seems likely. Stack Overflow is always near the top for programming language questions, but I rarely find SE language sites when I search for English or Chinese related questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose that everyone is too entrenched in their own communities now to change, but I thought I would suggest it anyway.</p>

"333215","What is the reason behind not gaining reputation for a user when upvoting, but removing reputation when a user downvotes?","<p>I am trying to familiarise myself with SO (company)/SE, reading posts such as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation"">""What is reputation?""</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/how-does-reputation-work"">""How does reputation works?""</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/17198/why-does-my-reputation-decrease-if-i-downvote-another-post"">""Decrease of reputation on downvote?""</a>, etc.</p>

<p>I've split voting elements per users' activity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passive change, reputation change based on prior user action.</li>
<li>Active  change, reputation change based on current user action.</li>
</ul>

<p>If links are up to date, the table should look as follows for users over 15 rep (upvotes) and 125 rep (downvotes):</p>

<pre><code>+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|         Passive change        |         Active change         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|| ACTION  |  RESPONSE  |CHANGE||| ACTION  |  RESPONSE  |CHANGE||
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| asked    |  UPVOTED   |   +5  |   ask    |   NONE     |   0   |
| asked    | DOWNVOTED  |   -2  |  answer  |   NONE     |   0   |
| answered |  UPVOTED   |  +10  |  accept  |  REP GAIN  |  +5   |
| answered | DOWNVOTED  |   -2  |  upvote  |   NONE     |   0   |
| answered |  ACCEPTED  |  +15  | downvote |  REP LOST  |  -1   |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|| OVERALL CHANGE IN REP|  +26 ||| OVERALL CHANGE IN REP|  +4  ||  = +30
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>So by this table, it seems that user is mostly rewarded to be passive (long term game) in actions. Make good answers and wait for initial <em>+10s</em> to arise. From active side of users, it seems that the main subvention is to accept answers, and rarely downvote, and with no incentive (or repercussion) for upvotes. <strong>I didn't count bounties at this table since they are offered at 75+ rep, but they don't generate change in rep, but they shift it from one user to another.</strong></p>

<p>After users grasps 500 rep, they have a clear way to help in moderation by using the review queues, and even though these rep changes can have benefits/costs earlier in rep (didn't find information at which rep you can edit posts), I am choosing to count it at 500+ rep:</p>

<pre><code>+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|         Passive change        |         Active change         |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|| ACTION  |  RESPONSE  |CHANGE||| ACTION  |  RESPONSE  |CHANGE||
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|edited Q/A|  ACCEPTED  |   +2  | edit post|    NONE    |   0   |
|edited Q/A| !ACCEPTED  |   0   |          |            |       |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|| OVERALL CHANGE IN REP|   +2 ||| ACTION  |  RESPONSE  |   0  ||  = +2
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Again, it seems that passive action is best suited for an every day user. When I looked into this I didn't count penalties (6 offensive/spam flags) or site association bonus (since rep gains don't affect the rep of users in total).</p>

<p>Most of these stats do seem logical to me. SO (comp) as a knowledge base has most value in quality answered questions than general questions, and I understand that there must be an incentive to check our work and not to downvote rashly and to accept valuable answers than have bunch of error prone.</p>

<p>What confuses me the most is that active voting down can cost you rep, but active voting up doesn't do anything. I am guessing that there is some trade off with accepting answers, but why is that? <em>I personally don't have an opinion on this manner.</em> but I do find it curious.</p>

<h2>Main Question:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the reason behind not gaining reputation for a user when upvoting, but removing reputation when a user downvotes?</strong> I am looking forward for both sides of the conversation.</p>

<p><em>Questions if you have some time on your hands</em></p>

  made no attempt to be exhaustive.  Ancient laws gave guiding
  principles, or samples, rather than complete descriptions of all
  things regulated.  Ancient people were expected to be able to
  extrapolate from what the sampling of laws did say to the
  <em>general</em> behavior the laws in their totality pointed toward.
  Ancient judges were expected to extrapolate from the wording
  provided in the laws that did exist to <em>all other</em> circumstances

"333910","Licensing question: Should Stack Exchange delete all my questions and answers when my account gets closed?","<p>While Stack Exchange can claim that all posts here are automatically CC BY-SA, that would fail when a user deletes their account (or gets banned) as they then become user5876892 or whatever. So instead of the real username, Stack&nbsp;Exchange would show a fake username. As attribution would be required, it would also be impossible for Stack&nbsp;Exchange to conform to this license. Thus, if an account is deleted then all questions, answers and comments by this user need to be deleted also, or they don't conform to the license.
Am I right?</p>

<p>So if an account gets deleted, it would become a copyright violation for Stack&nbsp;Exchange and other users to use any contributions by this deleted user. This means that this content can't stay online and will have to be deleted as well. And I mean complete removal, not just hiding them.
The alternative could be to keep the user name with all content but just disable the account.</p>

<p><em>Even though Stack&nbsp;Exchange has an infinite license on using the content, anyone else would have to comply to the CC license and provide attribution, which cannot be done if SE removed the original user name.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Reminder: this question is about the licensing behind Stack&nbsp;Exchange, not about how to delete stuff. The question is if Stack&nbsp;Exchange is allowed to anonymize content when an account gets suspended, as that would invalidate the attribution for the content.</p>

"335222","Prefer only 'they' for personal pronouns due to privacy and security","<p>This is specifically regarding updates to the new CoC (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334900/official-faq-on-gender-pronouns-and-code-of-conduct-changes"">Official FAQ on gender pronouns and Code of Conduct changes</a>) addressing personal pronouns.</p>

<h2>The point, up front</h2>

<p>With Internet hackers, bots, and miners collecting data and metadata on whatever content users put around the world, personal pronouns should be limited as a matter of security on any social media site (including forums like this).</p>

<p>The best solution would be to formalize the vernacular use of ""they"" for social media. Stack Exchange could be a leader in this.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This update to the CoC has been a source of division in the SE community; I started this when the vote count was -666. (I have not voted on it because I want to remain objective when writing this.)</p>

<p>Personally, I live by the rule that division and controversy indicate that there may be a more important question somehow overlooked. So, I reviewed my own beliefs about what I was reading...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I genuinely believe in the good will of both SE users and staff.</p></li>
<li><p>I have every intention to follow the new CoC; I'm not a ""rebel"".</p></li>
<li><p>I want a CoC that is a source of unity and not division because I want what is best for SE as staff, a company, and the community it celebrates.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of all: <em>I want useful online tools to keep users safe.</em></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Personal safety takes precedent</h2>

<p>I live in Asia and often meet people who are concerned about being put in harm’s way, either due to governments that violate human rights monitoring their social media and tracing their information back to the user or from angry mobs and hate groups seeking to beat up people with a different opinion.</p>

<h3>I think it is better for all user's safety if we encourage the good habit of not using personal pronouns in Internet discussion other than ""they"".</h3>

<p>I think we all overlooked this, myself included.</p>

<h2>Possible ways to implement</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>It could be a rule in the CoC to only use ""they"" for users' safety, with the disclaimer that safety and security must always come first and if safety leads to personal offense, that no offense is intended, but safety must be first, even when inconvenient.</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually, an AI could be written to rewrite personal pronouns in the discussion. But, the problem with that is that, if we agreed to this value of ""safety-via-pronouns"", the goal would be for users to develop good habits to use elsewhere. An AI would make it so that the habit wasn't developed, being too dependent on technology to keep us safe without responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know that users would need to be penalized, only reminded and have content corrected. This would be soft-handed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>...But, any good idea needs vetting from the community first. So, I'm posting this for vote and discussion.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am posting this genuinely to receive input from the community, <em>not just to opine</em>. Please, I genuinely invite answers that address better alternatives or reasons this would not be feasible or any other discussion.</p>

<p>Opening this Issue and been downvoted is discouraging too which signals not to contribute in making proposals or reporting annoying situations as a new user.  </p>

<p>That's not OK from the perspective that a user is spending time to reformat source code and improve readability but can't get it saved.</p>

<p>As a user without privileges to edit, this is not a good learning and undermines the process to motivate new users being active.</p>

<p>My proposal would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strike>If a user enters the edit mode, the question is locked for another
user to edit.</strike></p></li>
<li><p><strike>The lock should be limited in time (e.g. 10 minutes) and the

"337847","Increase the reputation gained from question upvotes on Meta Stack Exchange to 10","<p>Yes, I'm aware of discussions, leaks, etc. that have gone on recently regarding potential plans from SE to implement this network-wide. However, for the sake of this post, let's <strong>ignore</strong> those, and consider this as a standalone request.</p>
<p>tl;dr: I believe that here on Meta Stack Exchange, it often takes more effort to write a question, as much as or even greater than writing an answer, and the reputation gain should reflect that.</p>
<p>Here on this site, it often takes much more research, thought, and effort to write a well-received question than it does to write a well-received answer. When writing a question, you have to do a lot of research (e.g. &quot;based on the prior posts and what's going on, is this idea likely to be positively received by the community?&quot;, &quot;has this idea been proposed before? [if so,] what are some arguments against the reasons for not implementing it at this time and new arguments that weren't brought up in that prior post?&quot;, &quot;am I presenting my ideas in the right way&quot;, etc.). Even for a non-<a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a> post, you have to be nuanced in the ways you present your points so that people will be likely to give you a good answer or get a good picture of your idea.</p>
<p>Whereas to write an <em>answer</em>, it's much simpler, as often the question author has already done quite a bit of the work and research for you, so that all you need to do is make an opinion on it, or find the relevant post where something is mentioned. (That's not to say it's <em>easy</em>, but it is, <em>as a whole</em>, <em>relatively</em> easier than writing a question.)</p>
<p>If you were to go through my <em>questions</em>, you'll see that as a whole, they are rather long, containing many nuanced points, but if you go through my <em>answers</em>, they are as a whole shorter, and much of the research behind them just things mentioned in the questions they were answering. When I was writing them, I would take <em>much</em> more time writing a question than an answer on average.</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/86055/377214"">Some similar points were raised back when the reputation gain was changed to 5 in 2011</a>: *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta Stack [Exchange] is already different. The other sites, and even the site metas, are Q&amp;A sites. Here, you're not really writing questions (useless you're using [the <a href=""/questions/tagged/support"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">support</a> tag]), you are writing opening posts. That's because [Meta.SE] is actually a forum, not a Q&amp;A site. On [Meta.SE], a very good point can be articulated in the opening post. It does not work at all like other Stack Exchange sites. On [MSE], &quot;questions&quot; are just as important as &quot;answers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on that, I believe that the fact that less rep is awarded for writing questions than answers here on this site to be <em>pretty lopsided</em>. I'd argue that at least here on Meta.SE, it should be upped.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the same analogy can be applied to <em>all</em> sites, however. On some sites, e.g. Travel, it's more beneficial to retain the current reputation gain, because of the large amount of zero-research questions from new users (about, e.g., UK visa refusals, of which most are duplicates). There are also a bunch of posts already arguing against this being implemented network-wide for similar reasons, but most of those arguments don't make much sense for this site.</p>
<p>If you disagree with this request, it would be very nice if you explained why, so I can edit this post to address potential concerns.</p>
<h3>To those suggesting eliminating Meta reputation</h3>
<p>There was a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312004/what-if-mse-used-a-different-rep-model-for-privileges"">study</a> conducted as to the effects of using a different model for awarding privileges: either the sum of all sites, or the highest reputation on a single site. Both were found to unfairly bias Stack Overflow users, while the current model would help keep things fair. As was explained by Shog9 in the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest potential problem with either of these approaches is simply the raw volume of voters on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>The second-biggest potential problem would be the massive skew between upvotes and downvotes. When considering agreement or disagreement, this could be an issue.</p>
<p>The smaller potential problem... Is that <strong>it becomes even less enticing to actually participate here</strong>. Because there's no reputation, because voting is skewed toward SO, because the only people who <em>have</em> to participate here are rank newbies who can't post on any other meta... And employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, as argued by some folks in the comments, this site is essentially a Q&amp;A site...about Stack Exchange. Stack Exchange is &quot;its own area of expertise&quot; (as put forth by ArtOfCode).</p>
<p>Finally, a bunch of users (including me) derive most of my network reputation from contributions to this site, so they'd stand to lose quite a bit of their network rep.</p>

<p>This user had apparently decided that they could use these pronouns for everyone after learning about them for the first time.

<p>How can we gently educate people (or make people aware if you prefer) when this happens across the SE network that neopronouns are not a game, but are one of the ways we show respect for other people, and that using a pronoun that was not called for is disrespectful?</p>

<p>However, it seems people got bored with Winter Bash.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, I would love to hear suggestions from people that have
  nothing to do with hats. This was the 8th year we've done the same
  thing with different triggers and to be honest, I turned them off this
  year because I've gotten kind of bored with the idea. — <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/321554/suggestions-for-winter-bash-2019/321862#comment1052792_321554"">animuson ♦</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here are obvious questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why can't we have Winter Bash 2020?</li>
<li>If you got bored with the idea, I guess you are also bored with celebrating New Year, Christmas and all the rest of annual events.</li>
<li>Even if you are bored, can't we just change the main topic of the event? Change hats to vehicles for example, like it was <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/337932/403480"">suggested by Rob</a> in Winter Bash 2019 suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I really look forward to having Winter Bash 2020.</p>

<li>The FAQ should be accessible, above all, to newcomers as they are the ones most likely to need that information.</li>
<li>Being a newcomer myself I think there is just too much information in the FAQ and in this particular article</li>
<li>Background information should be hidden from view (via links) so newcomers can decide how deep they would like to dive into a topic and how much time they have available to invest. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible Change</strong></p>

<p>Summarize the FAQ answer in a very short manner which is readable in few Seconds. This answer should be structured like that:</p>

<li>Calm down the newcomers worries</li>
<li>Provide some basic reasons on why the downvotes happen  </li>

"344767","What ways does SE provide to handle complex questions in an agile way?","<p>I have a question which originates on previous assumptions and informations. I formulate this question in a way that contains (from my point of view) enough background information for someone to see its intent. However, there are answers/comments incoming which suggest that the people answering are missing background information or have misunderstood something. Those answers/comments seem to make it necessary to improve the initial question to either mitigate misunderstanding or include more background information</p>

<p>What tools/ways does SE provide to handle such a situation in an agile way?</p>

<p>I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Editing the question to include more background information. </p>

<p>This is bad for complex questions. I want to have the question-answer pair to be easy digestible for someone having the same question as me.</p></li>
<li><p>Splitting the question into different sub questions. </p>

<p>Bad as well. Then the sub questions are possibly answered but I will be the one answering my own complex question. This reduces credibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Clarifying those missing background informations or misunderstandings in comments </p>

<p>Works to some extent. Issue is that most people seem to not read the comments on answers, where the explanation is. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I am looking for a way to handle a complex question like a program in SVN.</p>

<ol>
<li>State it (write the initial code)</li>
<li>See that it's too complex for SE (some functions are too complex and need special handling)</li>
<li>Branch the question (branch the source code)</li>
<li>Merge and consolidate</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal at the end is that there is a distinct question-answer pair which is super easy to digest for someone having the same question.</p>

"344897","Review effect on reputation","<p>I have recently had enough reputation on Stack Overflow to review posts, and it's super exciting. However, I am faced with a bit of a challenge.</p>

<p>Some posts do not meet community standards and require a downvote. Now, I do understand it is important to add a comment so that the person who posted the question or answer at least knows what they did wrong. </p>

<p>However, and in my case for instance, with some posts, there has already been a comment under it to correct them. So I would downvote the post and upvote the comment. For some reason, this still affects my reputation and am deducted 1.</p>

<p>Can someone please tell me why this is still so, and if per chance this has not been considered or noticed, we could consider doing a check after a downvote if any relevant comment was upvoted.</p>

<p>I honestly do not see why I should comment again. I might just end up saying the same thing. The votes are a way of showing approval.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion</strong></p>

<p>Maybe we could have an extra review feature where vote reviews are reviewed again by people with a certain level of reputation in the community. Their review will be focused on the following after a downvote:</p>

<ol>
<li>Was there a relevant comment after the downvote?</li>
<li>Was the comment upvoted?</li>
<li>Could the reviewer have said something else? (This is to prevent people just voting down and voting up a comment to skip actually reviewing.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>Turns out downvotes affecting your reputation score has nothing in particular to do with if the action was done in review or not. (Thanks to all the comments and answer that clarified for me).</p>

<p>If so, my question stil remains that;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are we then being ""forced"" to comment even if the conditions do not require further commenting? As in the case of a bad post when one person makes a comment to list out the problems. Shall we also comment and say ""Yes he is right"" or repeat and bash people? Wont that make the platform uncomfortable and unwelcoming for new people?</p></li>
<li><p>If we are to return to each post we downvote to see if post is fixed, and if so, we upvote to get our reputation score back, how will someone with a daily 20+ genuine downvote decisions resolve?</p></li>
<li><p>I understand without going back to the post to check, you get your reputation points back on condition that the post is deleted. What if it is not deleted? There is a number of downvote requirement before a post is deleted. what if it never got there? </p></li>

<p>I think this looks awkward, particularly when you consider the space wasted when a user moves to the Answers tab from the All tab (the little mark saying that the listed posts are answered remains there, while serving no apparent purpose). It made me question the purpose of having an All tab in the first place. Questions and answers are on completely different levels, which is why we had these markers added in the first place.

<p>Over the last several months we've seen stackexchange ""the company"" use/abuse power, push/disrespect boundaries, cause community unrest and backlash and finally lawyer up (how sad).</p>

<p>I feel the turmoil occurred in part because there's no clear understanding, internally and externally, of those powers/boundaries are.</p>

<p>But what are the boundaries, exactly? What rights and obligations, if any, do the various types of people (visitors, users, moderators, employees, management, owners, etc) involved in the organization have?</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">constitution</a> embodies the definition of such concepts.</p>

<p>Note: This goes beyond a revamped moderator agreement. This is about everyone.</p>

<p>Given recent communications and decisions made by Stack Overflow management, needless to say the constitution would be toothless unless it nominated an independent body to resolve disputes, which would specifically exclude courts (even though suing seems to be a national sport of the US, second only in popularity to playing the “credit score” game) because getting a fair result should not depend on how deep ones pockets are, and which may include the collective community voting to determine the outcome, or selecting jurors from the community.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>users can recognize who has completed extensive work on subjects</li>
<li>users with certifications can use them to help others come up to speed, spreading the knowledge</li>
<li>users can know which answers have more weight to them other than the weight that the Stack Exchange ranking system gives to experienced &amp; active users</li>

"355596","Hide new Constituent badges on the all-badges page for current election until after the election (show to the user tho)","<p>One of the reason that some places in the not-Stack Overflow-universe don't share that or when someone voted is to help prevent voter intimidation. On Stack Overflow it's probably not as big of a deal because of the sheer volume of the site, but on smaller sites it can leak information that can lead to bad blood.</p>
<p>I propose that we not show who voted until after the election. Yeah, it's a lot of code for a small badge, but it shows that we have peoples' privacy in mind. Otherwise I can know who has voted so far in the election by just looking for the most recent Constituent badges on a given site.</p>
<p>As <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/361484/luuklag"">Luuklag</a> points out, it should not be shown on the user page either as part of this request for the current election. It's fine to show to the user, just not to the not-user.</p>

"355962","Cross-language site use and suspensions","<p>Imagine that a user was currently suspended on the Stack Overflow site in one language (currently English, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish, as far as I'm aware). Should they be allowed to use one or more of the various other-language sites instead? In making that determination, would it matter whether the user actually knew that language or was intending to pass all of their content (any questions, potentially including quotes from other sources, comments or answers) through Google Translate or similar<sup>1</sup>, leading to questions like <a href=""https://es.stackoverflow.com/q/408740"">this</a> and <a href=""https://ru.stackoverflow.com/q/1207878"">this</a>?</p>

sets up the OP, and anyone participating on the post, for a poor

"356077","Is there a policy for a moderator to fix a confusing or contradicting closing?","<p>People ask questions at all sites, and frequently some of the questions are closed by moderators. Moderators are not perfect and occasionally they leave unclear or contradicting closing information that confuses fixing. There is <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questions"">a clear policy</a> to draw a moderator's attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a moderator (user with a ♦ symbol after their name) closed the
question, then you may flag it for moderator attention. Again, do this
only after editing and include a detailed explanation of why it should
be reopened. There is more than one moderator, and moderators do
reconsider their decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I find a grey area even after the author asking in a comment and its meta as the policy suggests. If a moderator still doesn't reply to it intentionally or unintentionally, then the author will have no choice to fix their question based on confusing information, and could fix wrongly.</p>
<p>For <a href=""https://fitness.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/838/please-clarify-a-contradicting-closing-of-question/839?noredirect=1#comment1499_839"">example</a>, one moderator may leave contradicting messages like please narrowing it down in comments and send an off-topic closing private message. The narrowing-down's correct classification is <strong>require focus</strong>. It contradicts with off-topic.</p>
<p>This contradiction causes a real problem because</p>
<ul>
<li>Officially speaking, even one narrows it down as commented, a moderator can
still close it down for being off topic because a closing message is private, but official, and a public comment is not.</li>
<li>Publicly speaking, if one fixes the medical part as the closing
message suggests, it can still be closed by a moderator for not fixing the narrowing-it-down part and no one
knows it because it is a private message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both seem to lower down fixing quality for a user not knowing how to fix it exactly, and giving moderators too much power for allowing them leave a confusing closure without regulation, and no one can do anything about it. So, is there a policy if moderators still don't reply to a questionable closing even after author flagging, asking in a comment and meta as policy suggests?</p>

"357542","What does it mean when we say ""be nice to new users""?","<p>Today a brand new user to the SE community, asked a question about graph theory. This is the full text of their question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let G be a bipartite graph with 2n vertices exactly one perfect matching. Show that |E(G)| ≤(n+1). 2 Show that this bound is best possible for all n ∈ N≥1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moments later, an established Math SE user responded with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It appears that you are pasting your homework questions exactly, hoping to get someone here to provide you with the solution. If that is what you're doing, it is probably a violation of your school's academic integrity rules. If it's not what you are doing, you should explain in more detail what is actually going on and what kind of help you are looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To recap: this was the new user's second post on the SE community, and because they clearly asked it without fully understanding the norms and cultural conventions of SE, they are being accused of violating academic integrity rules, downvoted into oblivion, and found their post summarily closed.</p>
<p>In the ensuing discussion, the new user wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not an University student just want to have knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, they were self-studying, got stuck, and then tried asking for help on  a Q&amp;A site.</p>
<p>So, what does it mean exactly to &quot;be nice&quot; to new contributors? I ask this because I see brand new users on the Math SE site who fail to properly dot all their i's and cross their t's encounter accusations, downvotes into oblivion, and (what I read as) hostility pretty much any time I passively browse the site.</p>
<p>I know that it's common for people to dump homework questions here with the expectation that others will do their work for them. But at the same time, it's probably more common that brand new users don't actually know the cultural norms of SE, don't know the ins and outs of the site, and find themselves genuinely confused to be met with accusations of academic integrity violations for asking a question in a Q&amp;A community! It's no wonder that the vast majority of people I know don't consider Math SE to be a very inviting place to ask questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, it would seem that &quot;be nice&quot; should imply &quot;assume good faith&quot;. What am I missing here?</p>
<p>With regard to the thread that some have suggested this is a duplicate of, I don't find them to be similar at all. This thread is specifically about new users, and in particular about assumptions of bad faith on the part of new users. The suggested thread does address some points about hostility to new users, but not really the point about bad faith. Further, it doesn't ask wheter assuming good faith should be part &amp; parcel with &quot;be nice&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can a rainbow unicorn do?</p>

<p>And there's an answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can live in the 5th dimension</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it a problem if I post an answer starting with &quot;<em>I don't know the answer to the question; however, I'd like to respond to the answer about living in the 5th dimension</em>.&quot;?</p>
<p>I see some benefits for this rather than making it as a chain of comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better formatting and unlimited length</li>
<li>Voting</li>
<li>More attention and discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>I've seen many upvoted answers that state explicitly that they are just long comments to the questions. <strong>I also think sometimes the responding idea is important to be considered, and thus should be given an equal opportunity to be considered as the responded idea.</strong> I think this opportunity can only be equal when it has the same position, i.e. be an answer. I think while in general it is not recommended to put comments into answers, there are cases where the benefits outweigh the  disadvantages.</p>
<p>However, this raises two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Who gets to decide that the benefit outweighs the disadvantage? Different people have different views. The person about to answer may find it necessary if they think the existing answer has a bad analysis yet receives a good amount of upvotes because it sounds good. But even when we assume good faith, that is just only one point of view. What if the person who actually has a bad analysis is themselves?* It would be chaos if everyone started posting answers to comments.</p>
<p>(*My own response to this is that if their analysis is bad, then it would be downvoted.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>What about a response to a response? I think one way to solve this is only permit one level of response as answer. Response of response should only be in comment or chat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be easy to say that we just should leave comments in the comment section, because that's what it's for. But as I mentioned earlier, there seems to be cases where the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Motivation: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I had to do a triple-check that I wasn't imagining earlier versions of the comment that was edited after I flagged it. Also, an edit to the tone of the comment removes appropriate context to (the tone of the) comments that follow. At least when there is a time-stamp signifying such a change at a later time, one knows there have been revisions after what followed was written. The site ALREADY keeps a time-stamp of the comment. Why not keep the time-stamp of the latest (super-rare) mod's revision? </p></li>
<li><p>A user has only 5 minutes to revise a comment (one could still update a time-stamp though a number of revisions could suffice) but a mod can do it days later - so a time-stamp update seems appropriate.</p></li>

This is more common on the IT sites than say History, English Language &amp; Usage, Seasoned Advice, etc.</p>

<p>I don't know what the final wording should be, something like ""This question is lacking some vital information"". If the level of quality we want is at least 1, then the current ""unclear question"" message really only applies to quality below 0.5. I'm proposing a new message to apply to quality of 0.75 to 1, where the remainder (0.5 to 0.75) would go into one or the other as quality can be rather subjective anyway.</p>

<p>The current thinking seems to be that 99% clear == 100 % unclear. Yes, there is that 1% that is not clear, but there is a big difference between ""I can't even understand the gist of what you're asking"" and ""I can understand what you're getting at but I need {this specific information} to be able to start answering your question"". Most vote-to-close-ers don't leave feedback as to exactly what is missing, regardless of whether the entire question is low-quality or if it is generally high-quality except for one or two points, leaving it as an exercise for the OP to try and guess. So differentiating between these types of posts would be useful to the OP. Should they totally rewrite (or consider deleting) their question, or is it worth trying to salvage it?</p>

<p>This is what I mean, suppose I am a participant of  <strong>Movies.SE</strong>, <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> etc etc, and I log on to StackOverflow, if I have a notification pop up, it should be notifications that relate only to StackOverflow not any other sites and when I later go on <strong>Movies.SE</strong> I should get notifications for Movies.SE only... maybe with the only exception of their respective meta sites.</p>

<p>The reason I am asking is sometimes we come here with different agendas, like when you get referred by Google to a programming question, or maybe you want to come here and answer questions of certain nature, in order not deviate of your agenda by following these notifications to other sites with different topics I think this is good; because sometimes since that is not the reason I came here even though I see the notifications I ignore them, and when you later come back more notifications slaps you hence you can't keep up with others and it might look you actually ignored them or the question asked or you failed to accept an answer etc etc.</p>

<p>For example, I came here to seek an answer from StackOverflow and I saw a notification, from Movies.SE and I clicked on it.

<p>On security.SE, I posted <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/posts/116602/revisions"">this answer</a> on <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/116599/why-havent-we-proven-many-things-computationally-secure-yet?noredirect=1"">this question</a> (10k rep required on Security.SE) to <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/33522/991"">a question that later got migrated to crypto.SE</a>.</p>

<p>At least one, probably two or more, commenters to it accused me of it being plagiarism.</p>

<p>After I was pointed to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/160078/232555"">this answer</a> and saw the phrase ""<strong>any</strong> copying and pasting"" in it, I edited my answer to attribute the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zero-width spaces</a> to an old version of that Wikipedia article, since they were the <em>only</em> things in that answer which I took from anywhere else.

Admittedly, I did not and do not remember <em>which</em> version of the article I copied them from. After that (I'm pretty sure it was more than 24 hours after that edit), a moderator deleted that answer and left a comment saying I was refusing to attribute.</p>

<p>I could not reply to that comment <em>there</em>, so I asked on one of that moderator's answers whether I needed to <em>quote</em> the zero-width spaces, as well as asking something (I forget exactly what) along the lines of ""Should I not use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scare quotes</a>?"".</p>

<p>This post could easily have been filtered out on the keywords alone, let alone how they were put together.</p>

<p>It is so offensive it really caused pain for the handful of people who read it. It is taking a while to recover. This post is at the very least a fantasy of written child pornography, at the worst a story of horrific child abuse.</p>
<p>I had difficulty finding someone or enough people to flag it to delete it. Which leads me to the question.</p>
<p><strong>Can we increase the filters of what is posted on these sites to assist in preventing this kind o f thing occurring again rather than wait to be alerted to it after the fact?</strong></p>
<p>This post isn't about preventing curse words on the site, it's about setting a filter to prevent extreme NSFW and material that is so abhorrent it should not be too difficult to filter. As the post I am using as an example, would have been relatively simple to filter on. Or at least make the poster task of posting such matter more difficult. Within the content of that post there were multiple words and phrases that could easily be flagged and especially when put together in such number, there is no reason such content should make it on the site.
At least if content needs to be re-written in such a way that it is not so graphic, it will assist in keeping the site cleaner from the outset.</p>

"279939","Are moderators expected to edit questions for aesthetic reasons?","<p>I just noticed that on one of my sites, I've posted 41 answers, and one particular moderator has made 15 edits across seven of those answers.  None of the edits are for the usual stuff (e.g., spelling errors, formatting mistakes, tags, etc) - they all seem to be aimed at making the posts shorter in length by moving text around and fiddling with the placement of pictures.  Some of the edits are harmless and don't change the substance of the answer in a material way, but others are destructive and clearly aren't what I had in mind while I was writing the answer.</p>
<p>This moderator has made ~8,000 edits total, and about 1,500 edits over the past 5 months.</p>
<p>I reread <a href=""https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">&quot;A Theory of Moderation&quot;</a> to get a handle of the general functions of moderators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moderator votes are binding. Any place we have voting -- close, open, delete, undelete, offensive, migration, etc -- that vote will reach the threshold and take effect immediately if a single moderator casts a vote.</p>
<p>Moderators can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on or changed in any way.</p>
<p>Moderators can protect questions. Protected questions only allow answers by users with more than 10 reputation.</p>
<p>Moderators can see more data in the system, including vote statistics (but not 'who voted for this post') and user profile information.</p>
<p>Moderators can place users in timed suspension, and delete users if necessary.</p>
<p>Moderators can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing in the blog post says anything about making questions and answers suit
the moderator's aesthetic tastes.  In fact, the summary seems to suggest that doing so is not the purview of &quot;the ideal moderator&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The ideal moderator does as little as possible.</strong> But those little actions may be powerful and highly concentrated. <strong>Judiciously limiting your use of moderator powers to selectively prune and guide the community -- now that's the true art of moderation.</strong></p>

"281035","Flags shouldn't be cheaper than downvotes","<p>On Ask Ubuntu we have a very small minority of users who occasionally flag answers where the content might be technically incorrect (a wrong assumption, syntax error, etc), or it needs an small amount of editing to really work. These are cases where removing the post is not the desired final outcome.</p>
<p>They <em>should</em> be <strong>commenting</strong> to let the user know there's a problem, <strong>voting</strong> to add urgency and rank the questions properly or just <strong>editing</strong> to fix the problems in the post.</p>
<h3>Flags make it too cheap and easy to push quality issues off to 10ks and mods!</h3>
<p>So with the exception of the super-important flags {spam, offensive}, can I suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>We &quot;charge&quot; 5 reputation for each flags when the flag is created.</li>
<li>If a mod agrees, or otherwise finds it helpful, the flagger gets their reputation back. Maybe a +2 bonus (like suggested edits) to reward positive flagging behaviour?</li>
<li>If it's a lazy junk flag (and a moderator thinks it's a lazy flag), reject their flag with prejudice, keeping the rep they fronted.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds adversarial but I don't think this is something most of our flagging users would mind. They can afford it. And it would certainly underline the &quot;stop flagging rubbish like this&quot; reject reason.</p>
<hr />
<p>Additionally, the flag dialogue could include a &quot;CC and downvote&quot; this answer checkbox to highlight the need to tell the poster of a problem before it goes to moderators.</p>
<p>And edits should be rewarded for all users. Doesn't have to be reputation. Just a prominent count of edits that you could rank users by would help keep people interested in doing the tough stuff.</p>

"284142","Reduce mod election vote skewing by discouraging passerby users from voting","<p>I have many accounts on SE sites with little or no activity, and I get invitations to vote in their elections despite of that. Sure, sensible users will not vote, but sometimes they will, just out of curiosity or because they don't know how much their vote matters. And many people like that voting on superficial indicators of candidate quality such as candidate rating and the length of their nomination posts, skews the results.</p>

<p>Not displaying the invitation to visit the voting page is a bad idea for various reasons, so I'm not proposing that.</p>

<p>What I propose is for the users who have no recent activity to add a notice at the top of the election page saying roughly this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems like you don't have any recent activity on this site. If you don't have enough experience using this particular site, please consider refraining from voting or researching the candidates to make an educated vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would add something about knowing mods from other sites, and if they were good there, it's ok to vote for them, but that might not be a good idea because they might not be as good as other candidates on a SE site with a different topic.</p>

"284710","A site option to delay appearance of questions in the close vote review queue","<p>I specifically have (the recently graduated) <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/"">Motor Vehicle Maintenance &amp; Repair</a> in mind while writing this, but I'm going to go with the assumption this is applicable to some of the other smaller sites as well. This definitely does not apply to the larger sites. I'm also mostly thinking of the ""unclear what you're asking"" close reason.</p>

<p>This is feature request for <strong>the ability to have a delay between the time the first close vote is cast and the time the question appears in the close review queue, configurable on a per-site basis</strong>. Possibly only for certain reasons, like ""unclear what you're asking"". Order of magnitude is days.</p>

<p>There is often debate on Mechanics about closing questions (<a href=""https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1703/how-soon-should-i-vote-to-close-a-question"">example</a>). Some users prefer to put questions on hold quickly, others strongly prefer to wait. I am not sure what is right, but I would rather see consistent solutions based on site mechanics rather than unsustainable things like conscious clean-up efforts (these work, but rely on a lot of community effort, and run the risk of not working any more in the future if the core members responsible for these efforts move on).</p>

<p>I'd like the community to continue to function smoothly in the long run, and I think this must be accomplished through an effective site mechanic rather than through constant relatively difficult and unsustainable effort (especially as users who put consistent effort in inevitably move on in the future), and so I'm making this feature request with that in mind.</p>

<p>So, at least from my interpretation, the general arguments for waiting to put questions on hold there are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Putting questions on hold <a href=""https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1626/9884"">can be viewed as rude</a>.</li>
<li>Casting a close vote <a href=""https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1641/how-did-this-good-question-even-get-into-the-close-queue?rq=1#comment3013_1643"">can be a conversation stopper</a>.</li>
<li>Putting a question on hold <a href=""https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1703/how-soon-should-i-vote-to-close-a-question#comment3179_1735"">can be jarring to new users who aren't familiar with SE</a>.</li>
<li>It <a href=""https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1703/how-soon-should-i-vote-to-close-a-question#comment3179_1735"">takes users on the Mechanics site longer to respond with details than it does for a question to garner 5 votes in the queue</a>. Once the question ends up in the queue it tends to be closed quickly, especially because the queue is very small.</li>
<li>Reopening takes too long.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the points that seem to come up the most. I'm not including arguments <em>against</em> because I don't believe that's relevant to this post. Of all of the above, I find #4 to be particularly compelling.</p>

<p>This is based on the observation that once a question makes it into the review queue, it tends to get closed <em>very</em> quickly<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>So to that end, one site mechanic change that I think could be useful is to simply add some wait time before a question shows up in the queue. This way:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the question is truly awful, it will still likely be closed quickly (the site has a relatively low volume and most users read most questions<sup>1</sup>). If the delay only applies to certain close reasons (like ""unclear"") it will also help a lot here.</li>
<li>Reviewers won't be notified for some time after that first vote, which gives extra time for the OP to reply and comment discussions to clarify points. If clarification is received, then ""Leave Open"" will be more likely to be selected in the queue.</li>
<li>If a user sees a question with a close vote, but personally wishes to give it more time, <em>they can simply not add a close vote and just wait a few days for it to show up in the queue, thus removing the need for maintaining lists of questions to look at offline or in chat rooms -- which inevitably they forget about and the questions just sit around and rot until we make mass cleanup efforts</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the issues, I think, is that users are hesitant to cast the first on-hold vote, but once the question ends up in the queue, it becomes closed very quickly. That is, there is a bit of reasonable mob mentality, but that conflicts with the general desire to leave unclear questions open, and so that philosophy, while good, is fragile. I do not know if this is unique to that site or typical of smaller sites, but that is why I'd like to have it be supported by a site mechanic.</p>

<p>I think this idea will help back up the efforts there, and is generally useful on smaller, low throughput sites where similar patterns exist. </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>To be clear, even if most questions do have eyes, the fundamental problem for non-awful questions is basically that folks want to</em> wait <em>a few days before closing, which sounds good in theory, but this is difficult to do without expending a lot of effort maintaining lists offline.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Currently, I only have anecdotal evidence from other community members and my observations to back this up; I <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/160981/show-successful-close-reopen-votes-in-sede-regardless-of-if-theyve-expired-or-n"">do not have the power</a> to gather statistics on this.</em></p>

<p>I am convinced by this and the other points, but I wonder about another approach to fill the need for quick answers for that some users have (and don't have the reputation to create a bounty) without reinforcing the wrong behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can pay money to one of three charities (for example) to get points to offer a bounty</li>
<li>The money does not come back to the user if the bounty runs out and no one had answered the question (to stop people from not accepting answers to get their money back)</li>
<li>There is no financial incentive for the users answering the question; they just get points as usual</li>
<li>This does not replace the current system</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Because there is no financial incentive for people answering the questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, and after you answer, if the person refuses to pay up, Jeff and Joel should have to mediate the dispute. Or, maybe we can just migrate the question to LawyerOverflow?</p>

<p>Because the payment is to make the bounty not to get an answer via a bounty.</p>
<p><strong>What this does if allow people/businesses who need an answer an ability to offer bigger bounties to give their questions a better chance of getting answered.</strong></p>
<p>Some additional bonuses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Money will go to a good charity and good stuff might happen there</li>
<li>People who answered might feel better than usual because they contributed to something good</li>

<li>Opportunity for more badges and stats :D</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages I can see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Risk of changing the dynamic of the questioners. They might feel more entitled to an answer than usual.</li>
<li>Charities can be polarizing (especially if they are seen to align with a political party). A curated list of charities would have to be selected. The aim would be to choose ones that would not discourage potential people from answering because they don't like what the charity does.</li>

Comment 1:
<p>Interesting discussions below. I think there is a clear theme in the answers so far and something that I had not got from reading the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25615/offering-actual-money-as-a-bounty"">previous &quot;actual money&quot;</a> suggestion. And that is; <strong>stackoverflow</strong> is held up as an institution close to what Wikimedia Foundation is like. To summarise the Wikimedia Foundation goal ;&quot;[knowledge] to the public free of charge&quot;. This sounds similar to how some of the authors below see stackoverflow. I happily donate money to the wikimedia foundation in the same way as I am happy to pay tax for public services like the library. Interesting.</p>
Comment 2
<p>I would be interested to hear from someone who would like to make a case for the idea - if any exist ;)</p>
Comment 3
<p>One comment I found particularly interesting (from @ramhound)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So somebody who volunteers their time at the local ASPCA 3 times a week can't offer a bounty to their question but somebody who makes more money then that person can provided they offer a donation to the ASPCA. Who do you feel is more valuable, the person walking the dogs, or the person paying for the leashes to walk the dogs? I am the volunteer, if I am going to donate money, I bring in supplies myself. I don't believe in giving money to national charities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a) The price would be up for debate, but you point is still valid. I think it might be possible to overcome economic disadvantages at a regional level in the same way that this is done on Apple's App Store; different countries have different prices for the same thing depending on their economies. But this still does not address economic disparity within a region.</p>
<p>b) (slightly off topic) If the purpose of the charitable act (doing or giving) is to help target (someone/something), shouldn't the measure of the value of charitable act be dependant on the outcome for the target? Consider for example, is a community of volunteers in a suburb each spending 3 nights a week at the RSPCA AND you have Bill Gates who is not only paying for the running of the RSPCA in this subrub but 50 others just like it. From the point of view of the animals, Bill Gates has the most value. A badly waited example I know, but it illustrates the point. <strong>Note</strong>, this does not address the problems discussed in Comment 1 above. I just like thinking about this particular issue (eg, should CEOs of charities be paid insentives etc).</p>

"286702","Is it possible to get all one's questions and answers deleted because of stalking?","<p>If one is in threat of life because of being stalked, could one ask for deletion of all answers and questions? I don't mean simply removing the username; that is not enough.</p>

<p>Questions sometimes indirectly provide personal information that can lead to being identified, and it is impractical to read all posted content again, searching for such information (for example, questions and answers that cite previous works, or link to sites that allow identification). So posts are not really anonymous, and hence there's the need for deleting all user history. Would there be a monetary charge for this deletion? Is it possible?</p>

"287627","New additional Point Rating for users","<p>Currently, the point rating (PR) is the main user success feedback. Have you ever thought about the new <strong>additional</strong> point rating (NPR) based on weights?</p>

<p>That would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>A, B, C, D are users.
...
A has 25 points
B has 1000 points
...
C has 1 upvote from A.
D has 1 upvote from B.
=&gt;
D should have greater NPR than C.
... 
</code></pre>

<p>Also, another thing needs to be taken into account.</p>

<pre><code>G is the user
G has 25 points   
...
If G voted 600 times his votes should play no important role for the NPR.
</code></pre>

<p>Note this is not a fraud. G only tried to get the Gold badge. This is because some people may create accounts on their mobile phones and use them for raffle voting. The NPR algorithm should diminish those and make them look like the little babies. Imagine Google PageRank algorithm. You are losing the substance if you link too much.</p>

<p>Another thing...</p>

<pre><code>H, h1 are users
...
if H received 100 (hundred) votes and 25% of his votes are from user h1
</code></pre>

<p>User h1 should not contribute to the NPR score of H that much. This is not a fraud but should be called some second order fraud.</p>

<p>Note this may be the <strong>additional</strong> new point rating, so it will not remove or hurt the old one.</p>

<p>If <em>B</em> has 1000 pts, he showed possible a great effort to create his reputation. <em>B</em> also knows to value points and provides respectable feedback. The analogy with business success, if <em>B</em> has a great business, you trust him more over the <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>Real life: When you search for the now job position, you typically like better-rated companies over the lower rated. The same here. </p>

<p>There may be many other reasons why this may be smart.</p>

<p>This is just the initial proposal. Technically this can be done in superior quality I strongly believe because modern math theory may wing this idea. I am open if anyone needs more help from me. </p>

<p>This may be the challenge also, but we love challenges if they are smart. I haven't said this is smart. But if you think this is smart, don't care about computational complexity. Modern hardware can probably do that real time, else it can be done once daily or so.</p>

<p>And downvotes should also be in the formula. Not to forget that. </p>

<p>There will be certain coefficients that may change over time. As the coefficients are updated NPR will update. NPR may be something experimental at the very start.</p>

<p>The upvote from 25pts user vs. those having thousands of points should be different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. The problem is how do you act if you change any of the parameters. If a scheme is continuously tweaked, it loses credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A. After the experimental phase, the NPR will not update considerable. Take Google PageRank for instance. If you like the NPR may be something hidden at first. </p>

<p>Is there any usefulness (or maybe playfulness?) in adding a ""facepalm"" tag, or would that more likely be abused to ridicule a question (or the person asking the question) rather than the typical downvote (or vote-to-close)?</p>

<p>Is it because the Stack&nbsp;Exchange network doesn't want to spark controversy by including religious questions? Personally I would love to see a hot question from Christianity.SE pop up every now and then.</p>

<p>The same applies for Mi Yodeya, the Islam, and Hinduism SE sites. Why does nothing from there ever show up in the side bar?</p>

"290673","May a moderator be part of something she is moderating?","<p>I am used to moderators always staying away of issues they are moderating. They may have something to say about it but never do so at the same article/thread/question/item they are moderating.</p>

<p>Is that so here? Is there any convention or rule about this in StackOverflow? May a moderator moderate her own contributions?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q by Mary: How to change unicorn color?<br>
  A by Ted: Use magical elixir because of this and that.<br>
  [Many comments with discussion about it]<br>
  [Comments moved by moderator Jane to chat, she leaves a comment with a link to chat and explains that comments are not for extended conversations]<br>
  Jane follows by posting this comment (not in the chat): Actually about those things there are details which date back to the nineties, you may whatch this video(link) about how they changed unicorn color with so few magical straw. But again, all this is associated with making your own stable. I think you should define up to where you want to learn really and then research more and more regarding this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answers make me realize that there are instances where it is acceptable for a moderator to moderate where she is involved. I'll add another example (the last one) with greater involvement by the moderator.<br>

"291385","Merging all CMS proposals/sites into one?","<p>Currently there are CMS sites for a number of popular Content Management Systems and even more proposals for other CMS sites. Would it not be beneficial to the community to merge all CMS site into one single CMS site.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow could have easily been divided into individual sites for every programming language. Most of these sites would still have thrived, however, by keeping them all together it has achieved more then it ever could have if it divided them.</p>

<p>Would this not be true for CMS related Stack Overflow sites?</p>

<p>My reasoning is that a lot of developers use multiple Content Management Systems. These developers can answer questions related to a number of different Content Management Systems, but might only be active on one CMS site. Even though there are a lot of differences among Content Management Systems the core ideas are the same and they all share the same basic principle of managing content to be displayed on the internet. Programming questions about a CMS are better asked on Stack Overflow as it is focused on programming and you are more likely to get a good answer there.</p>

<p>It would benefit the CMS community to be merged because it would increase the 'available knowledge' of the community. It would also benefit smaller Content Management Systems that do not have a large enough following for their own site as it would give their users a place to ask questions.</p>

"292308","If I am concerned about unchecked sexism across the sites, how would I raise the topic or seek a task force?","<p><strong>Please, immediately and totally note, that <em>this</em> question is not to debate the existence of sexism on SE properties.</strong> I would like to have that discussion but I do not feel I have the tools for it now for reasons I will describe. This question is extremely meta for this reason.</p>

<p>On the bright side, every SE in which such questions come up seems to have a firm grasp of sexual harassment at the level that would be received by the law or by an HR department. I'm more concerned with forms of sexism that have only been modernly identified: ""subtle"", ""systemic"", ""microaggressions"", ""unconscious bias"", etc. I am more concerned with sexism in content (e.g. advice to women) but rarely direct disrespect to users of any identity. These forms of sexism are not safe to discuss openly. They are quite contentious to discuss openly. There is a time for open debate on these topics but it is not even possible to do that constructively if relatively like-minded people on these topics cannot congregate and get on the same page on their own theory and opinions. But, <em>in my personal opinion</em>, these forms of sexism are very rampant, especially in ""soft"" SEs, and there simply is not the tool or platform for the segment of users who would like to constructively challenge these trends to even try to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Another way of framing this is that at present I have a hypothesis or theory that an SE-style open discussion with a democratic structure is not sufficient alone to solve or prevent systemic sexism or other forms of bias. Were this theory to be correct, it would of course be impossible to address this through the community at large since its own platform is the same platform as for the smaller communities in question. So if the theory is wrong there is nothing to discuss, and if the theory is right there is no place to discuss it. So, naturally I've considered raising this issue on the metas of the communities in question, but I have a rather strong feeling there is a critical mass of bias in the communities themselves to even humor the topic.  (And this question is obviously a concerted attempt to break that theorem in the most modest way possible. We will see how it goes.)</p>

<p>What I would like to ask is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the company interested in exploring these questions, and if so may I be included in that discussion, or even just receive a quick status update on what is in the works?</li>
<li>Is there any mechanism, like an existing chat room, that has the attention of pulling in likeminded people to consider this problem, rather than open up a debate or vote to the respective SE communities as a whole? (This is a counterintuitive concept but there is time for fully <em>open</em> discussion and time for relatively <em>focused</em> discussion in which participants agree they share some common opinions for which dispute is off-topic...  of course sites like e.g. Christianity.SE utilize this principle heavily.)</li>
<li>Do I have the tools, short of an area51, to initiate such a task force myself? (And heck, an area51 might be on track, it does sound like a long shot to me though.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I really would like to get into specifics on this topic but I have a strong sense specific questions here and there would basically be shot down, to varying degrees depending on the community. So this question may seem peculiar but if the two bullets above yield decent answers it would be very helpful for me.</p>

<p>I just want to make sure that my question is on-topic and fits the rules in the help center, like it's not too broad, etc.</p>

<p>This is analogous to the idea when you have created an application and you want first to test it in QA and release beta version of that application first before releasing the released version of the application to the customer, because you never can know if you have bugs in the application you are developing or not.</p>

<p>So I never know if my question will get downvoted or not, so I am not taking risks anymore. I want that every question that I ask in this network outside meta won't get downvoted ever.</p>

<p>The main reason that I want to do this is because that many downvoted questions block me from asking questions forever and asking questions in the Stack Exchange community is very important for me and I don't want to get to the state that I can't ask questions anymore ever. Also downvotes decrease my reputation and I also don't want to lose reputations, but I want to gain reputation by upvotes instead, because I need this reputation for several purposes, like creating chat rooms (at least 20 reputations required) adding comments (at least 50 reputations required), downvoting (at least 125 reputations required), creating tags (at least 300 reputations required), starting bounties, which are very important to receive more attention, attract more answerers and increase views.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""home page"" of a Stack Exchange site will filter out all questions that fall below a certain threshold. This is -4 score for main Q&amp;A sites, and -8 for Meta sites. This is because the home page is meant to highlight quality content, so that a brand new visitor will see good stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens on all tabs on the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">front page</a>, including active. Isn't this a problem though? How are we supposed to see new activity on downvoted questions?</p>

<ul>
<li>If a question is downvoted quick enough, it falls off the home page before people see it. I know that some people <em>only</em> use the home page. While I don't know the exact number of people like that I noticed that here on Meta SE sometimes questions get downvoted and drop off the home page before they get enough close votes and when this happens it takes much longer for the question to be closed. I've seen this happen on other sites, where the threshold is much lower since they are main sites. It's just disheartening, especially because I also sometimes see this happen with spam and I don't like seeing such questions stick around.</li>
<li>Heavily downvoted questions that are edited don't get any attention, even if the question is perfect now. </li>
<li>On the flip side, a heavily downvoted question that is vandalized will not get any attention.</li>
<li>New answers don't get any attention. If people don't vote, good content can't ""float to the top"" like it should.</li>
</ul>

<p>And probably most importantly:</p>

<ul>
<li>New activity (both edits and answers) on downvoted <strong>meta</strong> posts will be missed. While downvotes indicate an idea is bad, many of these posts are <em>official messages</em> from Stack Exchange about changes that they're making. As a result, this isn't something that people would not want to see activity on. In fact, this situation happened on dozens of meta sites simultaneously when the new designs were launched (and on most of those sites people expressed how confused the disappearance of the downvoted meta post made them).</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand the desire to not show ""garbage"" to new users visiting the front page, at least on main sites. But I don't think it makes sense to not show these posts to users with some rep (or even an account) on the site. On meta sites, users tend to at least have some stake in the site, so I'm not sure it makes sense to optimize for showing brand new visitors good stuff.</p>

<p>...Or answer it with an answer that presents as a solution code which is irrelevant to the question.</p>
<h3>The answer.</h3>
<p>A genuinely pointless answer that initially mentioned two irrelevant issues, eventually reduced to one that doesn't even remotely address the problem stated in the question. Absolutely useless even as a comment, let alone being an answer.</p>
<p>The worst part is when you see that, you can do literally nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li>flag it for the review? A hilarious suggestion, given the review is for the grammar/language issues only.</li>
<li>flag it for the moderator's attention? The same, moderators do not judge the quality/correctness.</li>
<li>vote to close the question as off topic? Given you'll never get enough voters,  it's a waste.</li>
<li>write an answer? An answer which doesn't answer the question but explains why it makes no sense? These boy scouts from the review queue will be happy to trample it over.</li>
<li>write a comment for the OP? Telling they are outright wrong? One could find a better way to waste their time.</li>
<li>downvote? Yea, -2 reputation is a devastating blow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The despair.</h3>
<p>I cannot tell you how helpless I feel in a situation like this. There is no legal way to reason with such an answer. There is no way to remove such a crap from the site. There is no way to stop Stack Overflow from spreading the misleading information contained in it. So I went loose and just tried to blackmail the author, telling him that his answer is a fraud (the comments I left under the question are now deleted but you can take my word). So it backfired on me. Again, I don't complain for that. But I wish to know, will Stack Exchange ever do something to help those who care for the quality?</p>
<p>On the one hand, I quite realize that if someone wants to run such a populous site, they have to harness the worst parts of the human nature: laziness (encouraging zero-effort questions), greed (for the rep points), vanity (for the badges and other decorations). If zero-effort questions were really banned, the number of questions would drop hundredfold. If those who answer zero-effort questions weren't encouraged, then the traffic will drop, so will the revenue. So….</p>
<p>But OK, let's take for granted that the site is run on the zero-effort questions, occasionally producing good content just as a side effect. But shouldn't be a there a tool to remove at least a blatant nonsense?</p>
<p>There should be a <em>satisfactory</em> way to deal with this kind of contribution. The key word is satisfactory. Means it should be fruitful. &quot;Vote and move on&quot; doesn't count.

"305875","Allow questions to be bountied before two days if they are reviewed as ""Leave Open"" in the Close Votes queue","<p>The rationale of the 2 days delay before a new question becomes bountiable is that the community requires time to close a not eligible question.</p>

<p>The problem is with it, that the worth of an answer typically decreases <em>a lot</em>, if the bounty appears so much later. The motive to sacrifice a lot of reputation is much more weak, if the results arrive 2-9 days later.</p>

<p>My idea is that the OPs could have a possibility to <em>ask for a community review of their question now</em>.</p>

<p>I think it could be done most effectively in the close/reopen queue:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ""start a bounty"" link would be visible <em>for the OP</em> on the spot after he asked the question.</li>
<li>If he clicks ""start a bounty"" before the 2 day limit, the bounty wouldn't be started. Instead, a close review would be started for his question (but no close vote entity would be created).</li>
<li>If the question wins the vote (= 3 ""leave open"" votes are collected), then it would become bounty-able on the spot.</li>
<li>If the question loses the vote (= 5 ""close"" votes), it would become closed as usual.</li>
</ol>

<p>I expect the following results:</p>

<ul>
<li>There will be a little bit more close votes.</li>
<li>There will be much more bounties.</li>
<li>There will be <em>much more</em> users working hardly, but this time not for privileges, but to collect reputation for bounties.</li>
<li>There will be less workload on moderators as they wouldn't need to cancel bounties as often, as the questions will be reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the sites would switch from the current ""work for privileges"" and ""google for knowledge"" flavor to ""knowledge sharing"" direction.</p>

<p>Now, most sites have a per-site mod chatroom for having discussions related to the moderation of their site. That's where you usually go for getting the opinion of your site mods; the TL is for getting the opinion of the network mods.</p>

"306478","why not let question authors remove ""protected"" designation?","<p>It seems that the moderators are too loose with the ""protected"" designation.  I've seen this with questions asked by others and I've had it done to my own questions.</p>

<p>I've seen a number of questions without any down-voted answers become ""protected"".  I do realize that some answers may have been removed, but it wasn't the case for at least some of the questions I asked. Which makes it impossible to answer for new users who just joined the communities where the questions were asked.  </p>

<p>This is particularly impactful when it happen to questions in lightly-visited communities.  In such situations, a particular question may be interesting, but its author would never see many of potentially good answers which would be given by people joining these lightly-visited communities for the 1st time (often with the specific purpose of answering these questions).</p>

<p>Why not give the authors of questions ability to remove the ""protected"" designation?  Sort of as a ""I can handle bad answers better than no answers"" veto?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>After considering the following point made in Catija's answer: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Preventing the bad answers reduces the amount of work that the high-rep users and moderators have to do in order to clean up bad content. You don't get to make others to do this work because you want lots of answers or points of view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to agree with not allowing authors absolute right to ""unprotect"" questions.  However, in the interest of making the community more helpful, as much as possible, rather than coming off censorial, I will propose a feature request as following:</p>

<p>How about giving authors ability to <em>privately</em> unprotect questions?  A <em>privately unprotected question</em> would mean that ""new"" users can post answers and they will not be seen by community until the authors gain enough reputation (similar to how this works with upvotes on certain questions right now)?  Question authors should, however, see all answers -- even the ones hidden from the community due to low reputation of those who answer them.  Answers which are not eligible to be seen by the community should not be eligible for moderation, either.  This should reduce the flow of low-quality answers in the direction of moderators.</p>

"308545","Year-Round Hats for Fun and Profit","<p>Making hats available year-round, rather than limiting them to Winter Bash, would be a natural and powerful extension of Stack Exchange's gamification systems. This remains true even if hats are disabled for anonymous users and easy to disable for registered users.</p>

<h2>Why Would You Suggest This?</h2>

<p>The Xbox Live Achievements system was the inspiration for the original Stack Exchange badge system, in 2008. If somebody was viewing your Xbox or Stack profile, they might see that you'd unlocked some rare achievement, and it could inspire them to work towards that themselves. </p>

<p>But let's get real: most users rarely look at each other's profiles. (We have the view count numbers to prove that.) And while your peers might notice when you unlock your first gold badge, after the first few nobody will notice them ticking up. It's still motivating, but it's lost some flair. Video games faced the same problem. In 2008 it may have been cool to have a couple thousand Xbox Live Gamerpoints, but these days of my friends have so many that the numbers don't even register.</p>

<p>Now in 2018, when players accomplish some difficult achievement, they're often also rewarded with <strong>a cosmetic reward that's visible in the course of ordinary gameplay</strong>. For example, in Fortnite I was just awarded with an umbrella glider for my first win, and I get to show this off to fellow players at the beginning of every game. Hats can serve the same role here on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>If Shog earns the Socratic badge today, I would never notice.  But how could I fail to notice this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/eWY3H.gif"" width=""407""></p>

<p>Being able to highlight your accomplishments to your fellow users in the course of regular site use would be a fun incentive.</p>

<p>A key point to consider is who users are interested in showing-off <em>to</em>. I think that most users are most interested in showing off to fellow Stack Exchange users, since they're the ones who would be most most appreciate the accomplishments. For that reason, I think this would remain almost as effective even if it's disabled for unregistered users, so Stack's interface remains as clean as possible to people who wouldn't care. Likewise, an ""I Hate Hats!"" button should remain available to let disinterested users quickly opt-out.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Profit?</h2>

<p>I hesitate to include this, because of the general concern about mixing anything financial into the dynamic of the site. However, the site needs to make money somehow, and I think that <em>if done with care</em>, paid cosmetic hats could be added without ill effect. The most important point (which should be obvious but bears repeating) is that <strong>paid and awarded hats must be mutually exclusive</strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps we could have a new profile widget which explains how the user's currently-equipped hat was awarded. This would point to a badge for awarded hats, or display a message like ""for donating $10 in Spring 2018"" for purchased hats.</p>

<p>One potential model would be to have a set of exclusive hats that rotate out every season/three months and are never available again. As the user donates within a season, they unlock cooler hats, perhaps following a $5/$25/$125 progression.</p>

<p>This is not an original idea, and users have accepted it elsewhere. I am currently a moderator on <a href=""https://speedrun.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SpeedRun.com</a>. It is a community moderated <strong>and community-funded</strong> website. Users who donate to keep the site running get to pick a little flair to appear next to their avatar throughout the site. Users don't seem to have any problems with this.</p>

"308643","Could we get a filter for non NeuroTypical Thinkers to filter out Directed comments","<p>I know I am beating a dead horse, but that is because it is a topic that is so important to me personally but also the millions of us with autism that can nearly function in society.  </p>

<p>I am having this conversation because I am trying to figure out a way to make a connection with neurotypical people that will allow us to function normally. Think of it as trying to force left handed people to use right handed equipment. There is nothing wrong with being left handed. There is nothing wrong with the way we think it is just different. And we do not want to be excluded.</p>

<p>I believe if I can solve this problem for myself, that this tool will help us to integrate with NeuroTypical people so we can make you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>I believe I communicate most effectively with analogies so I probably over use them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>But I am requesting that we make a change in the rules of SE to allow us to play golf at your country club using left handed golf
  clubs, even though there are not that many of us that are left handed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I have a theory that I believe could be beneficial to the SE environment as a whole.</p>

<p>I exhibit common traits of people with a functional learning pattern. One of those traits is that we take comments directed at our username, as criticisms of ourselves personally.  I believe that by simply removing the @Username from all comments we can evaluate those comments more objectively.  And more importantly properly filter out the trash that neurotypical thinkers do intuitively.</p>

<p>I would suggest that when this option is active it is also important to remove the notification for comments directed at people with the filter enabled.  Another common condition is a compulsion to deal with alerts like the inbox.  I register that as a task that needs to be completed.  As a result it begins to cause anxiety for me immediately when I see the notification.  So the easiest way to relieve that anxiety is to deal with the notification, resulting often times in my feeling a need to reply to those comments.  If you notify me I will infer the @Username in the comment many times.</p>

<p>Please note.  This will not fix the comment problem.  People who want to cause problems will still try to cause problems.  But what this will do, I believe, is to reduce the amount of conflict visible on the site.  I believe that will reduce the need for moderators to deal with those conflict flags.  And will have a lasting effect of reducing this situational stress on the site as a whole.</p>

<p>What happens in my mind, and I believe this is common in people like me, is that we react to the acceptance of the perceived insult in the comment, by lashing back out in a way we feel is analogous to the slight we received.   I know that I am doing it, but doing it relieves a certain amount of anxiety so I do it anyway.  It is so habit responsive now that I often do not recognize I am doing it.  Or forget that I did it when the problem escalates.  And this problem builds until a moderator steps in.  And I believe that is the intent of the argument anyway.  Force the moderator to act.  All because of something I am not equipped to deal with.  </p>

<p><em>Yes this is irrational, and I am aware I should try to adapt, but all efforts thus far have failed, chances are I will take your attempt to help me solve my problem, that is probably obvious to you, as an insult and stubbornly refuse to even consider the possibility that you are right and I am wrong despite knowing full well that is what I am doing.</em></p>

<p>While I believe this feature would benefit me greatly.  What it does is give moderators a tool to deal with people like me, who have the ability to contribute very constructively and positively to the community, but also become irrationally disruptive.</p>

<p><strong>This is not an april fools joke... I have autism, I didn't make the connection that it could be percieved as one</strong></p>

<p><em>If you think you understand what I am asking for please edit this to explain it in a way that does not sound like making excuses.  I am trying to find a solution for people who don't fit in, to allow them to fit in.  That is my goal here.</em></p>

<p>One last attempt to relate my issue to you.  </p>

<ul>
<li>I have a bug in the programming of my brain.  </li>
<li>It is a bug that affects a small but significant number of <code>(systems)people</code>.</li>
<li>That significant number of people inadvertently create corruption of the data in <code>stackexchange.data</code>.(in the form of argumentative comment banter)  </li>
<li>It is functionally impossible to completely prevent those people with those defective systems from accessing the site, and corrupting the data </li>
<li>Dealing with the corruption of the data takes takes an unreasonable amount of the site moderator's time, and causes corruption of the <code>moderator.system</code> too. (in the form of stress)</li>
<li>This patch will not fix the problem with the defective systems, but it will allow this site to greatly reduce the amount of data corruption.  This will reduce the amount of time spent dealing with the corrupted data, and provide an overall more pleasant user experience, at the inconvenience of only those persons who take advantage of the defective programming to cause more corruption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expected results:</p>

<ul>
<li>a subset of people who previously read directed messages as insults are able to read the messages objectively an respond in a more rational, and expected manner.</li>
<li>Other people who see these messages directed at other people and previously perceived insult, no longer feel the need to defend others whom they feel are being picked on.  This reduces the overall conflict level of comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Potential other benefits:
 - This optional feature could be turned on permanently for members who choose to be disruptive anyway.  In this way it would limit the amount of comment discussions these persons can stay active in, because it will require manual following of each thread for updates. This will reduce data corruption.
- removing the ability to create directed comments from individuals who have engaged in argumentative behavior will prevent them from engaging in a prolonged instruction.  This provides incentive not to abuse the system, with out resorting to a ban hammer or gamification penalty that moderators are often unwilling to use.  </p>

<p>Please note: This feature <code>directed message notification</code> is an important part of the SE workflow and for most people this feature is beneficial.  Complete removal of this feature would, I believe, be detrimental to the site and is not being advocated for.</p>

And unintentionally maybe I broke some of them, because logging into today I was totally surprised by the notice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This account is temporarily suspended for rule violations. The

<p>The only reference was to <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/06/a-day-in-the-penalty-box"">A Day in the Penalty Box</a></em>, which does not explain the exact reason(s) why I was punished like that.</p>

<p>And I wonder how on earth we are expected to learn the right ways of doing things around here if we are not given the clear explanation of why we had been penalized in the first place?!</p>

<p>Is there a way to dispute this kind of punishment that could easily be subjective of whoever did this to my account? If not, is there a way to learn my mistake(s), so I don't repeat it/them in the future?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>First of all, thank you everybody who is trying to help me out of this situation. I apologize for not being able to clearly communicate myself. English is not my first language. But I will try my best to elaborate on some comments below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Contrary of some suggestions below, the account was created from a fresh, and there wasn't any conflicting or pre-existing account. I would avoid stepping onto number of mistakes if I was so experienced about using Stack&nbsp;Exchange and if I knew the rules.</p></li>
<li><p>There was no spamming attempt, and I have nothing to advertise. I have only tried so far to being useful and help users with their Drupal problems. Please someone from the mighty moderators review every single of my posts on <a href=""https://drupal.stackexchange.com"">https://drupal.stackexchange.com</a> and you will see there was nothing bad, only spending my own time and efforts to help others.</p></li>
<li><p>I have an impression I am being punished for being successful in helping users to find right solutions to their problems. My account gathered more than 800 points in about a month period. I don't know if that's quick or not, but I made a goal to come to the website every single day and try to find a solution to at least one problem. And my efforts were sincere, there was no any single intention to act on bad goals.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I just did not know all the rules, still don't know, and I don't think it is really possible to read every single letter of TOS to obey them under penalty of such death as my account is going through now. I just knew that to have a good intentions and to help people was good enough and that I would intuitively learn all the rules by time passing.</p>

<p>I do request moderators to read every single post I had and indicate what exactly I did wrong.</p>

<p>Really sad picture...</p>

<p>By the way, here is the screenshot of my <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/topbar/inbox"">https://meta.stackexchange.com/topbar/inbox</a> page:</p>

<p>As you can see there was no any notice about penalty. Nor I received any e-mail notification with regard why my account was penalized.</p>

<p>Also it is worrying that some suggest below that everything is gone. I do hope that my account is just under a temporary penalty and that I will get all the points gathered by putting so much effort will be intact. Please confirm this or I am just walking away as there is really no joy of becoming a member of such unfair environment.</p>

<p>EDIT #2: I see all my posts listed on <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/users/13116337/altagrade?tab=inbox"">https://stackexchange.com/users/13116337/altagrade?tab=inbox</a> intact, however clicking on them I see they all attributed to user83854. If anyone who is power will want to maintain a justice and bring my account back, then I will continue to be a member. Otherwise, I just do not see any meaning to put efforts to help others just to get punished like this for no reason given.</p>

<p>It is totally my fault to add that unfortunate description and I do accept the consequence.  </p>

<p><strong>Poena non adaequat.</strong></p>

<p>However, despite the unfortunate description of the profile, I was in fact the sole person using the account. And I believe ignorant users like myself (who did not read every letter of TOS and so were not aware of certain rules) should be given a warning, a chance to do right thing. Silently deleting their accounts and giving them no explanation does not serve the purpose of making the whole system better. </p>

<p>On the contrary it pushes them away. I will never again spend my time posting helpful answers on <a href=""https://drupal.stackexchange.com"">https://drupal.stackexchange.com</a> unless my account is re-instated in full, which apparently won't happen here.</p>

<p>And just in case if someone in power around here will want to fully investigate this case, here are some additional details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Soon it will be gone, but if you google AltaGrade now, then among other results you will see this one too:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/dQc3H.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/dQc3H.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you see even-though impact is small, my account still got into top 0.92% this year, it had many accepted answers and within a month gained around 800 reputation points. Because I was really trying to help users, giving them hints in comments and offering substantive answers to their problems. </p>

<ul>
<li>Cache for my profile is available at <a href=""https://bit.ly/2qQAscQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://bit.ly/2qQAscQ</a> for now, but here is the screenshot just in case:</li>

<p>I just wish moderators of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com"">https://meta.stackexchange.com</a> were little bit more verbose giving me a slight chance to make it right before silently deleting my account. I do really feel it was unfair decision. And I do hope the referenced rule was not just an excuse to get rid of another successful account that potentially one day could catch up and compete with their own reputations and rankings.</p>

<p><strong>Culpa ubi non est, nec poena esse debet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Systems without fair court where accused ones have a chance to appeal are doomed to all the flows of totalitarian regimes.</strong> I do like and do believe Stackexchange.com communities are really useful resources, however I do not think empowering its moderators with roles of judges and executioners at the same time serves the best interests of the general public and the system itself. So either you, those who have power around here, will start changing things or keep pushing away users with good intentions like myself away.</p>

<p>Farewell my friends!  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4 of April 22, 2018.</strong></p>

<p>I am still hanging around here, because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Drupal Answers moderators have not yet presented the full details of why they deleted my account and what was the biggest crime I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Since yesterday I've learned there are actual team accounts like, for example, this one <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/380926/devexpress-team"">https://stackoverflow.com/users/380926/devexpress-team</a>, which were never deleted. Unlike that account mine was in fact an individual account with just an unfortunate description. So could decision to delete an account be based just on a description without communicating with user, giving them a slight chance to survive?</p></li>
<li><p>Only yesterday I've learned my brother wanted to support my account and upvoted my posts several times. He swears it was only about 4 or 5 times and he did because my answers were right ones. And I am thinking could his actions also contribute to this mess? But then why moderators decided to punish not his, but my account? How on earth someone upvoted by another user can be responsible for actions of the others?</p></li>
<li><p>Per suggestions below I've sent a request to investigate this via <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/contact"">Contact Us</a> and really need to hear conclusive verdict before taking off forever. However I still have a hope the justice will prevail and my account will be re-instated or somehow re-built. I do believe it is technically possible, because as far as I can tell all the posts are there. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>And to make it easy if someone will want to read through my posts here are some links. Tell me I was not being helpful to users and I was a bad user who should be kept away.</p>

</ul>

<p>Strange enough that while trying to collect all my posts I could not find some of them. I do clearly remember posting and having more accepted answers, because I do keep all the code I worked to help other users locally. So probably some answers also got deleted.</p>

<p>For example, I coded a small module and posted it as an answer to this question <a href=""https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/258714"">How to grant referenced user access to Profile page</a> and it is not there anymore. </p>

<p>So why that answer was deleted is another mystery for me. I start having a feeling that someone just didn't like my activity and was looking for excuse to get rid of my account.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #5 on April 23, 2018:</strong></p>

<p>@kiamlaluno has added today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don't discuss in public such details, but the votes you got from
  the other account were enough to be automatically reversed from the
  system. Trust me or not, it doesn't happen for 5 up-votes. Also, I
  didn't say which moderator deleted the account. I would be glad if you
  would stop writing my name. Thank you. – kiamlaluno 56 mins ago</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my immediate reaction to his response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@kiamlaluno, thanks for the update, but do you really want to say that
  if someone wants to kill another account then all it takes for him to
  upvote the victim for 5 times?! It simply does not make sense. Punish
  voting account, but why punish the victim account whom someone else is
  disservicing?! – AltaGrade just now   edit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really do not mind the details of this case discussed publicly! I don't have anything to hide. The secrecy you are building on this could imply I indeed did something nasty. And I am absolutely sure I did not and that the deletion of my account was something totally wrong. Common, guys, spill it out! Why to hide the details if I did something really wrong - prove to public that you were righteous! </p>

<p>Just think everybody: if someone decided to support a new account and did several upvotes, then however his intentions were right or wrong such person's account must be scrutinized, not the targeted account as it is a victim here. Getting undesired upvotes and getting deleted without any notice whatsoever.</p>

<p>Investigating my case will prove upvotes made tiny part of my reputation points collected by trying <strong>really hard for the whole month helping people</strong> with their problems and offering accepted solutions! But the big question to me is <strong>will anyone bother to really investigate this?! Do I stand any chance to get the justice here or I am waiting in vain?! Will SE mods do something about this kind of arbitrariness of moderators?!</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 6: Apr 24, 2018</strong></p>

<p>Every day <strong>things keep changing</strong> and I am getting more and more convinced no justice will be served here.</p>

<ol>
<li>According to @kiamlaluno's confirmation my account was initially deleted for it had unfortunate description that it was a team account. However, after two days of asking questions and learning the true facts piece by piece, the accents has now shifted to something else:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>@user202729 From my side, I will never publicly say this user was a
  sock-puppet of that user, this user was involved in a ring-vote, or
  this user and that user were really the same person. – kiamlaluno 10
  hours ago</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I feel indeed helpless as the moderator's words and accusations weigh more than whatever I say. And apparently nobody will want to understand they are based on pure guestimations. </p>

<p>I am indeed a new SE user and that's exactly why I didn't know some easy rule like you could not have a team account. All I was doing is helping users with their questions. I did not ring-vote! If someone else did something wrong then why I should be kept accountable?! </p>

<p>If decisions on SE portals are based on moderator's personal conclusions, then the question <strong>WHY I WAS NOT PROPERLY NOTIFIED</strong> remains?! How on earth I was supposed to know why my account was deleted? Why it takes so much efforts to learn true reasons behind moderators actions?! Don't you see if users learn their accounts got deleted because some moderator decided so, then maybe they would never go to seek truth?! Not knowing for why you got deleted is the real problem here!</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Another sudden change:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>@user202729 I am just saying what I saw. The account used for this
  question joined Drupal Answers 3 days ago, which means it's not the
  original account the OP is talking about. The new account has not been
  suspended by any site moderator. – kiamlaluno 10 hours ago</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's simply not true. Up until today I the following notice was there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This account is temporarily suspended for rule violations. The
  suspension period ends on May 4 at 7:45.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, today it is not. So someone decided to unsuspend my account. But that belated pity is not useful at all as there is no slight wish to continue to be around here let alone to use it. I am not seeking for half-baked belated actions. I'd like to hear SE mods conclusive decision and then be off. </p>

<p>At this point I just wonder will they go <strong>easy</strong> way staying by an obvious mistake done in this case and so get rid of me or will they indeed investigate my case to at least admit things should've done bit differently here and try to keep me around? </p>

<p>God knows I would like to continue to be helping Drupal users in solving their problems, but decency requires not to eat this kind of mis-treatment to my account. </p>

"309626","Has stack exchange considered a behavior rating?","<p>The Stack Exchange network has individuals that have gained a high reputation answering questions about <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/users"">interpersonal skills</a>.  It would be great if these types of people were rewarded for helping out other sites in the SE network.  Particularly sister SE sites that suffer from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/?cb=1"">interpersonal problems</a>.  </p>

<p>I like how SE uses points to build up trust and reputation.  I'm not suggesting that changes.  When I build up a reputation on a site like Stack Overflow, presumably the majority of people vote based on my technical abilities. In other words, the reward system doesn't consider my behavior.  </p>

<p><strong>There should be a metric to encourage people to increase their interpersonal skills/emotional intelligence.</strong> . Not to punish bad behavior rather reward good behavior.  <em>No downvotes in the behavior feature</em>.  No user visible points.  It doesn't matter if points are required in the backend to implement the system.  The whole thing could be activity based, but it would be great if people could reward others for good behavior.</p>

<p>Would it be wise to implement a behavior rating?  I'm personally not a fan of points on such a system.  I'm not even sure how such a thing would be implemented?  Red to green?  Hitler to Gandhi?  Some class based system where a % fits into each?  Visible to all or just the user?  I dunno.  I feel that to get such a thing right you need to at least make it clear why you have this rating and how you can make it better > best.</p>

<p>Ideally this system will carry across all of SE.  If we could somehow get people with high interpersonal skills (from interpersonal skills site and all SE for that matter) to moderate/assist those that don't (from a suffering sister site) isn't that the highest level of community we can achieve?</p>

<p>Before you dismiss this clearly controversial topic, please at least read the article by Jay Hanlon I posted above.  ""Let’s reject the false dichotomy between quality and kindness"".  IMO, quality and kindness go hand in hand.  If I call into a customer service desk and am treated horribly, but they get the answer right is that acceptable?  Should this be acceptable online?</p>

I think this tactic is creepy surveillance and violates the CoC; it's not nice to keep everyone's comments on record, and then let <em>other people</em> (especially non-moderators) in chatrooms bring up the comments again and again for discussion, causing more and more unnecessary and unwanted drama.  This is particularly important when some users may post comments that they subsequently wish to delete shortly after.

<p>Some questions could be migrated to one of our foreign language sites which is a friendlier approach than trashcanning their thoughts. Other questions are either spam or otherwise unsuitable and should be deleted.</p>

<p>In order to ease the auditor's job I request a feature where a translated version would be available either underneath the question itself or via a link.</p>

<p>My complaint is that I was reviewing questions on Stack Overflow and encountered a question in a foreign language. Per our policies I chose ""Requires Editing"" <strong><em>because</em></strong> the English language is to be used and our CoC requires us to ""be nice"" and ""welcoming"" - it doesn't obligate us to translate questions.</p>

<p>I failed the audit because (it claims) I should have rejected it as spam.</p>

<li><p>We are not obligated to translate - if it was SPAM in English I would have rejected it, it is the obligation of the <strong><em>writer</em></strong> to have a suitable question.</p></li>

<p>I'm not overly concerned about failing one audit, I'm concerned about the fairness and an audit that may be against policy. A link to an automated translation would speed the auditing process, reduce errors and permit us to helpfully suggest migration of useful questions.

<p>In the question asked <a href=""https://meta.mathoverflow.net/questions/638/why-adding-a-comment-requires-50-reputation-points"">here</a> regarding the necessity of 50 reputation as a bar for allowing comments, the most highly voted answer specified that the main reason is spam protection. This makes sense to me, and I completely understand that giving new users the ability to comment right away (or almost right away) will create a flood of comments with no actual value.</p>

<p>From my very limited stackexchange experience, it seems that in some communities, getting 50+ reputation can actually be very challenging. For example, in math.stackexchange, since mathematics is such a huge area, finding new and trending questions one can answer is actually a difficult task, unless one is truly a math expert (at the very least a graduate mathematics student). In addition, it also seems that contributing to older posts (even ones without an accepted or a complete answer) will usually not earn the user new thumbs: there are many posts that are a couple of years old, and these mostly stay inactive even if new and valuable information is added. This is also true for suggesting edits to older posts. I am sure there are other communities that pose similar challenges for responsible beginners who aren't already experts in the field. I want to emphasize that when I say beginners I don't mean high school students: even excelling undergraduate math students will have no chance to answer the vast majority of new questions.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think that considering new ways to earn the basic privileges of the site (mainly commenting), such as time since registration, number of days performing an activity etc' can be beneficial. This will still prevent new users from creating an account immediately after they found a single relevant question and automatically starting to comment on it and related posts. However, users who are responsible, are truly interested in being long-time stack exchange members and didn't join just to ask a question and disappear, will always eventually be able to be more fully participating members. </p>

<p>I am sure such a feature will also lower the amount of content posted as answers posted simply because the user doesn't have commenting privileges, which to my understanding is a relatively common and unwanted phenomenon, which shouldn't be suggested as a workaround. Commenting can also be more likely to properly revive an old inactive post, since it directly notifies the relevant answerer rather than the asker.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: explaining the difference between my question and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267119/split-reputation-into-trust-and-expertise"">this</a></strong>: In my opinion, the association bonus provides a full solution to the problem described in the other question, which was sharing reputation across different stackexchange forums. My problem is not concerned with sharing reputation per se, but with the initial problem of obtaining reputation in a single forum to begin with. For example, many undergraduate students use a single stack exchange forum to help with their studies, and might not have other interests or knowledge relevant to other forums, in which case the association bonus will be of no use. As I stated in the comments, I think the association bonus is still a good partial solution, but it is not a full one. I might accept one of the answers mentioning it since it is significantly better than nothing. </p>

<p>If comments are <em>truly</em> <strong>only</strong> to suggest improvements, then should they only be visible to the OP, commenter, and “@“-tagged users?</p>

<p>Note: new users could and should continue to comment on their own posts outside these rules, this is much less of a problem for the site.</p>

<p>Further ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>How about making them invisible to &lt;10k-reputatiom users? This should retain some self moderation. How about 100 reputation instead?</li>
<li>Could high volume duplicates be mitigated by having a prominent link to chat instead of comment “if you don’t have direct suggestion”? (My understanding is that currently most new users don't even know about chat until asked to join by a current user).</li>

In short, it bases on the broken window theory, which states that minor forms of bad behavior encourage worse ones.

<p>However, unlike off-topic or exact duplicate questions, unclear or too broad ones indicate that OPs are still struggle to learn, and may need a moment of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">insight</a> to fix it.

"318796","Change the title of ""Hot Network Questions"" to make it clear that it's referring to the overall Stack Exchange network","<p>This was a point raised in a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/279661/usability-issues-for-first-time-stack-exchange-users-a-micro-study"">micro-study performed by ArtOfCode</a>, but is even more relevant now because of the recent removal of an entire site from Hot Network Questions for...known reasons.</p>

<p>To quote a part of the study results (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Hot Network Questions - what?</h2>
  
  <p>HNQ was one of the most confusing features mentioned. On a page full of questions about <em>gardening</em>, looking at the sidebar and seeing questions about <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Windows 10</em> next to each other confused my test group. Some sample reactions:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Aren't those questions off topic here?</p>
    
    <p>What's <em>the network</em>?</p>
    
    <p>What's <em>Hot</em>?</p>
    
    <p>Why are <em>these questions</em> here with the gardening questions?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I can tell, this played a rather large part in provoking the original tweet that resulted in the site's removal: a visitor saw links to questions about personal relationships on a site that was <em>supposedly</em> focused only on programming.</p>

<p>When I began my first foray into teaching older, middle- and high-school kids, the first course offered at my university for students in that <em>particular</em> track involved teaching kids as young as first grade. The reason they did so was that you can't assume that those older children have the same level of general knowledge as yourself: the fact that you start off teaching kids who are <em>totally</em> new to reading, math, or science helps demonstrate that perfectly. </p>

<p>Similarly, you can't assume that someone who isn't familiar with Stack Exchange shares the same background knowledge, or is aware that the term ""network"" refers to the overall Stack Exchange network of Q&amp;A sites (or in the case of readers of Stack Overflow or other sites not hosted on a stackexchange.com domain, know that that site is a part of it).</p>

<p>For this reason, I propose that the title of ""Hot Network Questions"" be changed to something that makes it clear to users unfamiliar with the SE network, such as ""<strong>Hot on the Stack Exchange Network</strong>"", ""<strong>From the Stack Exchange Network</strong>"", or per Monica Cellio's suggestion, ""<strong>From our other sites</strong>"". Either one of these titles would directly address the middle two issues mentioned earlier, and a user who looks just a little further will probably get their answer to the first and last issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re not even sure <strong>the internet</strong> was a good idea […] In this case, we set out to rank the websites […] that influenced the very nature of <strong>the internet</strong>, changed the world, stole ideas better than anyone, pioneered a genre, or were just really important to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia, however, chooses to capitalize the term</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> carries a vast range of information resources and services,…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in a separate entry, where the use of the capital I is debated, it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A significant number of publications do not capitalize internet.</strong> Among them are <em>The Economist</em>, the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>The Times of London</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Observer</em>,[12] the BBC,[13] and <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em>. As of 2011, most publications using &quot;internet&quot; appear to be located outside North America, but the gap is closing. <em>Wired News</em>, an American news source, adopted the lower-case spelling in 2004. Media companies like <em>BuzzFeed</em> and <em>Vox Media</em> avoid capitalizing the &quot;internet&quot; similarly. Around April 2010, CNN shifted its house style to adopt the lowercase spelling. <strong>The <em>Associated Press</em> announced that the 2016 AP Stylebook will no longer capitalize &quot;internet&quot;</strong>. <em>The New York Times</em> announced their decision in May 2016 to decapitalize all instances of &quot;internet&quot; for reasons similar to AP's. As Internet connectivity has expanded, it has started to be seen as a service similar to television, radio, and telephone, and the word has come to be used in this way (e.g. &quot;I have the internet at home&quot; and &quot;I found it on the internet&quot;).</p>

<p>Can we please agree that whoever bumps a post because they believe, falsely, that the term <em>internet</em> must always be capitalized, should think twice before doing so.

They deserve a reward! Hats aren't just for fun because getting a hat means that you did something good on the site, and if you get a lot that means you did some <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/48314748#48314748""><em>pretty spectacular things</em></a>. Most of these things are contributions to the site(s), with the exception of a few fun ones. So I propose that <strong>the <em>very</em> best Winter Bashers</strong> get a little boost in reputation for being <em>amazing</em> participates in the community.</p>

<p>Winning places in one community would get you a bonus in that community, and winning the SE Network-Wide Leaderboard would give you your bouns in the community you earned the most amount of hats in (or all communities, but that seems like too much...)</p>

<p>So here we go:</p>

<pre><code>#These numbers are just examples and reputation
#amounts could be changed and lowered as needed.
1st       = +100  
2nd       = +75  
3rd       = +60  
4th &amp; 5th = +45
Top 10    = +25
Top 50    = +10 # These last ones could be too
Top 100   = +5  # much. Maybe remove them?...
----------------
20+ Hats  = +10
14+ Hats  = +6
 8+ Hats  = +4
</code></pre>

<p>Results would not stack up, so for example, 1st place does not mean you get a 2nd place bonus too.</p>

<p>Basically, lots of hats means you are <em>really</em> helpful to the community, so why not reward them with a tiny gift?</p>

<p>I'm aware that the longest possible chat suspension length is generally 9,999 hours, or 417 days. However, I've noticed a couple of chat users recently that are suspended for <em>far</em> longer than that, on the order of 1.1+ <em>million</em> days, or 3,200+ <em>years</em>.</p>

<p>After some digging around, I discovered that the 9999-hour restriction is client-side only; if you defeat the client-side restriction, the server will happily accept any larger value.</p>

<p>I have a few questions:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If the longest suspension of 9,999 hours is not long enough, should that length be increased? Maybe if it's not long enough such that they have to bypass a client-side restriction, since Shog commented that it's not recommended, the limit should be both increased and enforced server-side?</p></li>

<p>Searching on the words ""removed"" and ""deleted"", I found things about pet vacuums, private lists with lifetimes and privileged access.  In fact, there are several places that lifetimes seem to be implicit in the automation associated with ""deleted"" content.  There is also information on features related to ""deleted"" content and time limitations.</p>

<p>Since the documentation uses the words ""removed"" and ""deleted"", and the site behaves as though the content I am trying to access has been removed/deleted, <strong>I am trying to understand why content would actually be removed/deleted</strong>.</p>

<p>I understand that there can be economic and physical reasons for restricting resources.  Do these reasons play an important factor when choosing to delete questions or answers (really, any content)?</p>

<p>I also understand why things get hidden.  I don't want to stop anything from being hidden.  I don't want to change why things are hidden.  I don't want to unhide anything that has been hidden.  I believe it is in my interest that the things being hidden are hidden.</p>

<p><em>I am interested in finding a way to be more liberal in allowing any person to access a hidden thing if the person knows the path to the hidden thing.</em></p>

<p>When I say, <em>I am interested in finding a way</em>...  I mean, I am trying to determine if there is an important system requirement that would prevent a feature change that allowed <em>any person to access a hidden thing if the person knows the path to the hidden thing</em>.</p>

<p>I think that an important aspect of my thinking is hinged on the bit, <em>if the person knows the path to the hidden thing</em>.</p>

<p>Everything I have read so far implies the idea behind hiding is to remove disruptive content from people's view.  For a few people, e.g. the ones that took the time to create a bookmark, the hidden thing is not a disruptive.</p>

This inspires people to come to this meta or site-specific metas to ask ""why were my comments deleted"" (e.g. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/208526/why-were-all-my-comments-deleted"">here</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/222624/when-are-all-comments-deleted"">here</a> and <a href=""https://politics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3859/why-were-all-of-the-comments-on-my-question-deleted/3860?noredirect=1#comment9550_3860"">here</a> and many many others.)  There is even a tag that seems to be specifically for this thing, <a href=""/questions/tagged/deleted-comments"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;deleted-comments&#39;"" rel=""tag"">deleted-comments</a>.</p>

<p>Although I would not go so far as to claim consensus on the matter, almost universally an answer is given and receives upvotes that hinges essentially on a line from the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment"">comment policy</a> ""Comments are temporary 'Post-It' notes left on a question or answer."" This answer generally boils down to, I think ""Comments were deleted because comments <em>are by nature ephemeral</em> and therefore <em>are subject to</em> being deleted."" (e.g. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/208529/341762"">here</a>, <a href=""https://politics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3860/20887"">here</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/312139/2886575"">here</a>).  However, in giving this as an answer to ""why were these comments deleted?"" it seems to suggest that not only <em>might</em> comments be deleted but, in fact, comments <em>should</em> be deleted.</p>

<p>However, at least one of the ""should""s on the comment policy suggests that <em>some comments</em> should possibly be at least long-lived.  Specifically: ""Add relevant but minor or transient information to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).""  The phrase ""minor <em>or</em> transient"" and the example ""a link to a related question"" suggests that there may exist comments whose use is not transient, but is instead minor, and may be useful for longer than it takes for the OP to read and comprehend it.</p>

<p>So, is it the case that <em>all</em> comments <em>should</em> be deleted?  If not, then there exist circumstances in which a comment should <em>not</em> be deleted... what are those circumstances?  How can we tell the difference between comments that should and should not be?</p>

"325583","Question titles cannot be similar to those of a closed question","<p>I wish to ask a question (on any Stack Exchange board) with a similar (or identical) title to a question that is closed. But I'm not able to do this.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this is a mistake.</p>

<p>If the previous question is closed for a reason that doesn't preclude it being a perfectly valid question (e.g. a moderator felt the description wasn't clear enough), then why shouldn't the same question be asked again, with a different description? After all, no answers can be provided to the first question, and yet the question merits being asked, and being answered.</p>

"325872","Is the ability to downvote questions necessary?","<p>I'm wondering whether the ability to downvote questions <em>in the currently implemented way</em> is the best way to handle bad questions. I'm ignoring meta sites for this, as they're far more complicated and voting works differently there.</p>

<p>The benefit of downvoting answers is very obvious to me, if an answer is wrong or simply not a good answer, downvoting it pushes it to the bottom and lets better answers rise above it. For questions it is not as obvious to me, especially as it's far more nebulous what actually defines a bad answer. For questions there is also a parallel quality control mechanism in close votes. And downvoting questions doesn't let better questions rise to the top in the same way it works for answers, it doesn't do anything for question lists or specific tag views, only for the frontpage.</p>

<p>One important aspect of downvotes is that they feed certain automated mechanisms designed to reduce moderator burden and clean up the site, the automatic question bans/throttling and the automated deletion of questions after a certain time. </p>

<p>One drawback of the current way downvoting works is that it is often perceived as very hostile, probably to a largely irrational degree. Even as an experienced SE user I still get a bit frustrated when I receive downvotes that I don't consider justified. And this effect is certainly much worse for newer users. I don't want to open this specific discussion here, but the perceived hostility is a significant issue in my opinion because it likely reduces the number of new users starting to participate, and a steady stream of new active users is necessary to sustain an SE site.</p>

<p>In my subjective observation there is also plenty of spurious voting on posts that are not actually bad. There is no general agreement on several aspects that people consider to make a question a bad question. A single downvote doesn't mean anything, there is too much noise in downvotes to gain any information from it.</p>

<p>Another issue I have with the current downvote mechanism is that there's often an excessive amount of downvotes for really not that terrible questions. The amount of downvotes is driven by attention (just like upvotes), and it often feels like kicking a user again when they're already down when you drive their question far into the negative score.</p>

<p>To me, closing is the primary way of moderating questions. Downvoting questions feels like an inferior parallel moderation system to me. The advantage of closing is that it actually explains to the user what is wrong with their question and gives them a chance to fix it, even though few take it. Downvotes don't tell you what is wrong.</p>

<p>The negative reputation penalty of downvotes also doesn't serve any useful purpose in my opinion. It's too small to have a serious effect on people that ask crappy questions, and it's large enough to simply annoy people. </p>

<p>What would happen if we remove the ability to downvote questions entirely? The question ban and the automated deletion script would likely not work well anymore. I'm not sure the experience for answerers would substantially change. The frontpage would also show questions that would have been below -4 score previously, and the worst possible score would be 0 for any question, so you would not quickly distinguish questions with no feedback from questions with negative feedback (but still unclosed). The asker would receive less feedback that their question might be bad, but only in cases where people don't post that feedback as comments and also don't close the question.</p>

<p>If we assume that community moderation in terms of closing questions works well, I don't see many drawbacks in eliminating downvotes on questions. This is a rather big ""if"", but maybe more an argument for improving the close system than having a lesser, parallel moderation system in downvotes.</p>

<p>Do we actually need downvotes on questions, or are they a superfluous parallel moderation system alongside close votes? </p>

<p>Now, I understand the algorithm is designed to help less active and low attention posts get some attention but the whole process seems counter intuitive to me. Many a times, the Community bot will push multiple older posts to the top leading to newer posts being dropped from the visible section of the screen. Although there could be an argument for the ""Week"" tab being used, we all know how the users interact with such forums. Majority of questions that aren't about mainstream topics or trending topics tend to get pushed down due to the Community bot. Unfortunately, most of these questions that are pushed to the top also tend to be out-of-date, which means the whole idea doesn't work as well as it is supposed to.</p>

<p>Now small chats (between several people) work as archives and commenting usually stops after it is moved to a chat because it is very inconvenient for all users to update a chat page many times without any notifications if it is not an extra interesting big chat with many people.</p>

<p>One recurring theme in the discussions about these issues, reflected even in the headline of <a href=""https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/01/stack_exchange_controversy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the article in the Register</a>, is that the main incidents being discussed occurred in private and cannot be publicized without breaking Stack Exchange policy. This has led to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper?page=1&amp;tab=votes#comment1091856_334043"">conflicting accounts</a> from different parties who were able to witness them.</p>

<p>And, prior to Monica Cellio's dismissal, <a href=""https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1195/1130"">Aza's resignation post</a> refers somewhat obliquely (in my opinion) to private conversations and actions leading to her resignation. In a comment, she wrote,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately I don't think I can be much clearer without posting message logs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I would like to know is, do the benefits of having separate communal areas for moderators, particularly the Teacher's Lounge, outweigh the lack of transparency entailed in this privacy?</p>

<p>This has been discussed a little before, and I found the concerns in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/134025/218334"">this answer from 2012</a> rather prescient. But I have not seen an existing discussion of why the Teacher's Lounge and other private areas for moderators exist.</p>

<p>I do understand that moderation requires dealing with sensitive material, and that moderators may wish to discuss sensitive issues with each other prior to taking action in some cases.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that there is a degree to which moderators form a separate, private sub-community, one where, apparently, quite a bit of drama is hidden from the public eye. I am not sure I see the advantage of this, and I don't see why it is a <em>necessary</em> aspect of moderation. For instance, having a public channel where only moderators can post would still provide a way for moderation decisions to be discussed without non-mod interference, but it would automatically increase transparency of the moderator community.</p>

<p>Even having a separate private channel for discussing things that, for one reason or another, <em>must</em> be private, in addition to a public moderator ""lounge"" channel for general discussion, seems like it would facilitate keeping sensitive information private while giving interested members of the community the ability to see how the moderator community operates and behaves.</p>

<p>Is this logic still sound? Should SE consider rewarding subtle variants of a question? Or at least stop stigmatizing them by calling them duplicates to invite downvotes?</p>
<p>So I feel a parallel question label is the ideal solution - it links your <em>problem</em> to <em>an answer</em> instead of to <em>a question</em> for the OP to rummage around through looking for a pseudo-related answer. First, parallel is the accurate term to describe two things arriving at the same place. Like driving Interstate 10 West and Highway 66 West both will take you to Los Angeles, but certainly they are not &quot;duplicate paths.&quot; The same is true about questions.</p>
<p><em>(The example below is ridiculously simple out of respect for your reading time. A <a href=""https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/951/should-different-questions-that-yield-similar-duplicate-answers-be-closed/956#956"">complete and detailed example is found here</a>)</em><br>
Here are 5 paralel questions which lead to the answer, &quot;1967 Chevrolet Camaro&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the first Chevrolet muscle car?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What was the pace car in the 1967 Daytona 500?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did the Camaro ever have window vents?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What was the black car in <em>Better Off Dead</em>?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What was the Chevy II Nova frame based on?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The band-aid approach used now is to simply link the &quot;duplicate&quot; question to the original and shut down answering for the &quot;duplicate.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The real-world problem for users</strong></p>
<p>To the point, assume I am an expert because I found a note from Gene Roddenberry detailing how the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/120925/what-is-a-zero-point-extraction-system"">zero-point extraction system works</a> in the Star Trek fictional universe.

<li><p>I can't answer Phoenix's led as a dupe. No answers allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A can't answer the parallel question &quot;How are self-replicating mines supposed to work&quot; because my answer doesn't talk about the whole mine, it talks about this magical system used in many things. My ZPE answer would be off-topic and low quality for a question about mines. I would get down-voted. Also, Phoenix will never know their question was answered because answers to the parallel question doesn't alert them.</p>
<p>My trove of valuable information is in an information graveyard created by poorly-connected meta data with an epitaph reading <strong>What is a zero point extraction system? [duplicate]</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Factually</strong> these two questions are parallel, not duplicates. The mines use a zero-point extraction system, which in a good response would explain what that means, but we don't advocate for that. The cycle is here: Q1:How does a mine work? A:It uses a ZPE. Q2: How does a ZPE work? A:[Duplicate - see Q1] Information death.</p>
<p>I feel users like Phoenix who arrive at a common solution by different paths should not be deprived of all reputation. The site benefits from their work in broadening the search effectiveness, yet the answer to their question can never be posted.</p>
<p><strong>Hasty Rough draft of a feature - preventing dupe stigma</strong><br>
Parallel questions can both link to &quot;duplicate answers&quot; as a <em>possible solution</em> as voted by users (A user votes that the question's answer already exists and adds a link <strong>to the answer, not the question</strong>, just like dupe questions do now), as well as add reputation to the parallel poster when the parallel answer is up/down voted. Phoenix can &quot;accept&quot; a parallel answer voted by another user, conveying reputation.</p>
<p>Yes, this does mean one single answer can appear under and be voted on for two distinct questions, depending on how sitable it is to each. Answers do not have rote up/down vote counts instead an u/d count per parallel question is recorded.</p>
<p>Eventually the answer quality encompases a larger scope of questions and is arrived at by many more search terms.</p>

"334771","Why not reward blind voting?","<p>&quot;Independent&quot; expert opinions are always more valuable than consented ones. Would your scientific article be more trusted if ten peers offered completely independent opinions, or if it offered the opinions of ten scientists who sat at a table together and shared their notes? The peer review F.A.I.T.H. model expects each opinion to be IDENTIFIABLE with its exact source. How could we possibly know where an expert opinion came from if that expert offered an opinion only after polling other experts first? I personally would not know for certain unless I knew that the expert did NOT poll others first. Most people do not. So to improve trust, we should give the community an ability to look at independant expert opinions. To that end, we should reward experts who volunteer independent opinions without first polling other experts.</p>
<p>Surveys preferably conceal their results to remove <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">response bias</a>. Blind survey votes naturally induce trust, we should embrace that reality.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of the biases blind votes eliminate, making them intrinsically more valuable than naked votes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Status quo bias</a>: Preference for the current state of affairs or &quot;Bandwagoning&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Outcome bias</a>: An error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known. E.g., &quot;If I downvote this post it will be closed; therefore, I will not downvote.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Omission bias</a>: The tendency to favor an act of omission over one of commission. E.g., &quot;These votes suggest the post is controversial therefore: I will not vote.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In-group favoritism</a>: Favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. E.g., &quot;Moderators like me upvote, I should upvote!&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anchoring</a>: An individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information offered -the &quot;anchor&quot; - when making decisions. E.g., &quot;This post has a -10 score. I will look more critically at this post to decide.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Systematically removing bias promotes trust in new users, which will increase our user base.</p>
<p>For these reasons I feel voters who choose to vote in the blind should earn reputation slightly faster as an incentive to self-abstain from prejudice. As a user preference, vote scores are not displayed on any post until you have voted on it.</p>
<p><strong>Applicability</strong> across different exchanges likely will vary. I feel hidden voting is universally beneficial yet naked votes should remain the default option.</p>
<p>Moderators on this site have confirmed that they use the vote score to decide if they themselves will cast a vote (fallacy could be due to any of the above biases). As such vote scores are influencing site moderation to the detriment of objective post content evaluations.</p>
<p>Some moderators argue a vote score helps make a decision whether or not to close a question. This is another argument in favor of this feature because moderators will have an incentive to cast a vote - they want to see the score. Yet in either case, the option is ...an option. Mods can elect to vote in the clear.  The moderator workload would also be greatly reduced. As a feature it addresses many SE questions, such as these linked below.</p>

<p><strong>Cheating with in-private searches</strong>
Comments bring this issue up and it's not explicitly detailed in this question.
As it stands vote counts are not available to in-private browsers. You only get a differential &quot;score&quot; subtracting down-votes from up-votes. A wholly useless number.  Thus if a vote is split 50/50 with 100 upvotes favoring it, and 102 downvotes disfavoring it, the in-private search shows a very deceptive &quot;-2&quot; vote count, creating the false impression that &quot;no experts agree.&quot; The score currently available to in-private searches provides zero quantitative data and is no more useful than a simple up/down arrow. It would serve searchers more if it were a simple ordinal ranking in the list of responses (An honest vote box should simply show vote majority as either ↑ or ↓ and present responses to the user in rank order: Highest to lowest, accepted on top)</p>

"337993","We Really Love Hats!","<p>Winter Bash is approaching and the general sentiment is <em>meh</em>. I tend to agree, nobody is in mood for festive activities... besides that after having a few bashes, it gets less interesting. </p>

<p>On the other hand, all kind of crazy ideas are going around about making sites more friendly, more approachable, more easy going, more fun.</p>

<h3>Well, if there is one thing fun around here it is Winter Bash.</h3>

<p>I joined Stack Overflow in November. Winter Bash came soon after. And for a new user it was fun. But more importantly it was also an opportunity to learn about the site and its inner working without having to read boring walls of text. </p>

<h3>So, do we really need Winter Bash?</h3>

<h2>Absolutely, YES.</h2>

<p>And not only Winter Bash, but the Summer Bash, Spring Bash... basically</p>

<h3>All Year Bash for New Users</h3>

<p>This is the perfect activity for new users. Give them a more relaxing experience of the site, nudge them to participate more and to learn through fun, without changing (breaking) already established rules and the reputation system.</p>

<p>Besides the usual Winter Bash, we could also have an additional fixed period Summer Bash around the summer solstice.</p>

<p>But more importantly, we could have some hats that promote good actions and learning for new users all year round.</p>

<p>Instead of hiding down votes, or giving more reputation to questions, they could earn limited time hats (valid for a month or two) in addition to actions that reward badges.</p>

<p>For instance: reading the tour, visiting the help center, asking a good question...</p>

<p>Badges are nice but they are just dots on your profile. Hats are more fun and through learning about hats new users could become valuable members faster.</p>

"338915","Low-quality questions should be easier deletable by their OP","<p>There is nothing better than someone, who wants to maintain a high-value account.
In fact, many users do but there are are a few things that complicate that matter.</p>

<p><strong>I think that low-quality, low-value questions should be deletable almost exclusively, regardless of the presence or absence of answers.</strong>
Question posters may have just asked the wrong question.
The inability to delete it, because of the presence of ANY sort of answers is just vile.</p>

<p>Sure, me being totally fine to get my answers deleted by the OP along with the question does not mean others would agree, but if you know that this may happen you will be free to decide on your own, whether to ""invest your time and effort"" in such a falling apart question. Putting your time and effort into low-quality questions have almost no contribution value to anyone.</p>

<p>The new changes regarding question upvote value suggest that question askers are found to be not less important than answer posters, but this also requires a look into their privileges respectively or the whole idea behind that is not what they say it is (or it is, but only partially - i.e it is rationalized).</p>

<p>Perhaps questions voted &lt; 0 should be deletable by the OP.
Another purposed criterion is that the answers are not voted yet if the idea behind this is that radical.</p>

<p>How I would have done it?
If user wants to delete its question - fine. If there are answers to that question with reputation > 1 their author will get notified that the question OP wants to delete the question (reputation unaffected). When and if all answers with reputation > 1 get deleted, the question will get deleted automatically immediately after.
It is a balanced approach that keeps the social factor but also allows users to get rid of their old irrelevant low-quality bad reputation questions.</p>

"341447","Would it be possible to add a “Hey Guys” warning filter/block to question and answer posting on some Stack Exchange sites?","<p>One thing I have noticed over the years of being on Stack Exchange sites is the consistent use of “Hey guys…” as an opening declaration of many question and answer posts. Not everyone who participates on Stack Exchange sites is a guy — or even desires to identify as a “guy” — right?</p>

<p>When I catch them, I remove them while keeping post context in mind. But considering the Stack Exchange network’s desire to make this place a more friendly and welcoming place for all, would it make sense to add a “Hey guys…” filter that would warn or prevent posts from being made of the words “Hey guys…” show up in the post?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Super User</strong>: <a href=""https://superuser.com/search?q=%22Hey%20Guys%22"">Here are the search results I found on Super User</a>. As of this post it shows about 80+ posts with “Hey guys…” very clearly at the beginning of each post.</li>
<li><strong>Stack Overflow</strong>: And when rolling over into Stack Overflow, a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%22Hey%20Guys%22"">similar search shows about 9640+ posts with “Hey guys…” right at the beginning of the post as well</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The type of filter I am thinking of is similar to the one that catches anyone posting a question title with the word “Help” in it. But in this case it would — of course — attempt to detect words in the body content of posted questions and answers.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z3rGK.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z3rGK.png"" alt=""Title filter in action.""></a></p>

<p>What the wording of that red text would be and what would it link to? Unclear myself. And I would not be insistent that posts be completely blocked due to “Hey guys…” triggering a warning; perhaps something like an “FYI” box shows up that allows an original poster to self-edit if need be. And perhaps limit such a filter to the tech-focused sites since those fields — for better or worse — tend to be male dominated.</p>

<p>But I personally find the low-level buzz of “Hey guys…” being posted on Stack Exchange sites something that can be dealt with and lead to positive outcomes for all.</p>

<p>And honestly, it seems to consistently be in the first two words of the body of a post, see screenshot below of the results on Stack Overflow for example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/z9Uh6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/z9Uh6.png"" alt=""Screenshot of search results for “Hey guys…” on Stack Exchange.""></a></p>

"350467","Can questions capture and show how much time the user spends writing them?","<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>There is not much information available when making split-second decisions whether to close or reopen a post. Specialist fields can limit the ability for a Close Voting User to accurately close a post.</p>
<p>For example, meet Bob. Bob is near retirement age and has 40 years of experience in software development. He likes the idea of StackOverflow and is thinking about becoming a major contributor when he retires. He spends 10 minutes crafting a clear precise question after not finding an answer on StackOverflow. He posts it and it is practically immediately closed as duplicate. Bob knows it's not, and with very little understanding of the culture and rules, he decides to quit StackOverflow, and pursue a leisurely life of live art performances underwater with blooms jellyfish. Such a loss.</p>
<p>Incorrectly closed posts have an adverse impact on novice (and experienced) users who humbly reach out, but don't know the rules, or are simply misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>Other ideas</strong></p>
<p>There are probably a few ways to improve these &quot;information famine&quot; and &quot;impaired experience&quot; problems. Any feature that can measure these problems, or word toward reducing the impact are great advancements to the community culture.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The collection and display of more data points on a post provide Close Voters with more context to make more informed decisions quickly.</p>
<p>Bob's life could have been more enriched with StackOverflow. Instead of closing the question, a Close Voter might have instead decided to add a comment. &quot;Welcome to SO, it looks like your question is similar to X, I can see you spent 30 minutes searching for answers, and 10 minutes writing the post, please help me understand how your question is different so I don't vote to close it&quot;</p>

We even got to a point that we now have a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/325416/why-isnt-providing-feedback-mandatory-on-downvotes-and-why-are-ideas-suggestin"">separate question</a> about why these topics are ill received.</p>
<p>With the release of the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/12/how-we-built-it-articles-feature-stack-overflow-teams/"">articles feature</a> on Stack Overflow Teams I saw an opportunity to raise this topic once again. But this time with a suggestion on how we could implement feedback on downvotes while remaining anonymous.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the new articles feature there is a way to provide feedback to the post owner directly and privately. As was demonstrated by this screenshot I took from the blogpost:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/sMGGqm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/sMGGqm.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>With a few adaptions I think we could easily repurpose this into a feature to give feedback when downvoting. (I am explicitly <strong>NOT</strong> saying that this should be obligatory!)</p>
<p><strong>How could we do that you ask?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we <strike> make it so that the default user who sends the feedback is <a href=""https://stackexchange.com/users/-1/community"">User -1</a>, also known as Community♦.</strike> simply don't show your name to the post owner. As Catija pointed out in the comments, moderators need to be able to trace who provided the feedback in case anyone abuses the feature.</p>
<p>Optionally you could choose to have your name attached to the feedback you send.</p>
<p>Giving feedback in this way, without leaving a public comment, makes sure that you are not traceable as the poster of the feedback. Being traceable as a downvoter is currently the biggest downside of giving an explanation as why you downvote, as it opens you up to revenge downvoting.</p>
<p><strong>So are we going to see this screen every time we downvote, making downvoting a two-click process?</strong></p>
<p>I think that would be a really negative experience, as a lot of times you don't feel like leaving any feedback, especially here on Meta. On the other hand new users could really benefit from getting feedback on their first few posts. Hence I propose we make the feedback pop-up automatically when downvoting a post from a user with less then 100 reputation (the association bonus level). In this way we can, to a certain extent, remediate the unwelcoming feeling new users get when their posts are instantly downvoted without them knowing what is wrong with them. Of-course the dialog should come with a cancel button if you don't feel like leaving any feedback.</p>
<p>For posts from users with more then 100 reputation there should just be a button to open the dialog. It could be located right under the downvote arrow.</p>
<p><strong>Will I need to type in the same reason every time I give feedback?</strong></p>
<p>That would be a cumbersome thing to do, I suggest we take a couple of canned reasons. Perhaps we can simply repurpose some close reasons for this. <strike> Together with a free-form text field this makes for a quick way to give meaningful feedback. </strike> Reading the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/353143/361484"">answer</a> by GhostCat and the comment from Catija I think it would be best to not implement a free-form text field, as this gives too much opportunity for abuse that is hard to catch.</p>

<p>As someone listed this question as a duplicate of the canonical question, that I referred above, I'll try to summarize how this is different from the arguments raised in the answer there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downvotes are, first and foremost, a content rating system.</strong> Yes that is very true. The potential of this feature lies in the fact that feedback is anonymous, and thus easier to give.</li>
<li><strong>In the vast majority of cases, nothing needs to be clarified.</strong> If you feel that is the case just click the cancel button on the dialog. But with the downvote tooltip stating:</li>

<p>There is a lot of room for improvement. The message here is overly broad, and hidden in the tooltip. Who goes to downvote his own question to see this message? You don't want your mouse near that button on your own post. So wouldn't a message straight in your face be far superior in conveying the message?</p>

<li><p><strong>Any requirement could be trivially circumvented</strong> Yes, I suggested to place a cancel button in the dialog, hardly possible to circumvent that when it is optional to use.</p>

<li><p><strong>It may not feel that way to you at the moment, but downvoters are doing the site a service, and making voting more difficult would impede the site's most important quality-control tool.</strong> I couldn't agree more. My proposed feature would only create friction when voting on posts of users with &lt;100 reputation. Minimizing the friction to where it is most needed, and where it has the greatest effect. Also such a dialog would be easy to circumvent with a userscript, or perhaps even a profile setting. In that way users that <strong>really</strong> don't want this don't have to have it in their faces, while the more casual users can provide the valuable feedback needed for new posters.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scale.</strong> With canned reasons scale is not an issue here.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If downvoting is made more difficult, then upvoting would need to be made correspondingly more difficult.</strong> A dialog that opens after you downvote a post hardly makes it more difficult, even so when that dialog can easily be closed/cancelled.</p>
</li>

"272279","Can there be some method of clearly stating what functional differences exist on smaller SE sites as opposed to the core SE sites","<p><sup><strong>Preface:</strong> I am posting this here as an adjunct to <a href=""http://meta.scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/7854/proposal-let-there-be-a-very-clear-explanation-of-how-comments-work-on-this-se"">a post I just made on the meta site for “Science Fiction and Fantasy.”</a> My post here will be far shorter and more “high level” since what I ask there is about a communication need and what I am asking here is for the proper tools to potentially sate such a communication need.</sup></p>

<h1>Let’s make the functional/usage differences between core SE sites and smaller SE sites more obvious to casual users.</h1>

<p>Given that many of the smaller Stack Exchange sites have different cultures and given that many of the smaller Stack Exchange sites use the tools of the system to different degrees, <strong>would it at all be possible for there to be some very obvious and clear feature available to all sites that acts as a “Here is what we do differently from Stack Overflow…” page/guide.</strong></p>

<p>I—like many others—discovered Stack Exchange via Stack Overflow and realize that is the main site and many of the tools available to all sites stem from them being “battle tested” on Stack Overflow. Utterly reasonable and pragmatic approach to feature integration.</p>

<p>That said, many of the small Stack Exchange sites simple use the tools available in ways that are counter-intuitive to anyone used to the way the main Stack Exchange sites work. For example, on the “Science Fiction and Fantasy” site, comments often have a much longer—and well respected—life than they have elsewhere across the Stack Exchange network. Expanding the comment management system functionality is truly a can of worms that I don’t believe anyone should touch with a gajillion foot pole. <strong>But I still think some way of conveying high-level usage/site-culture differences like this is necessary to the overall health of the community.</strong></p>

<p>That said it would be nice for casual users—such as me—to have one canonical page/guide/welcome that states something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to this site! While you might be familiar with Stack Overflow,
  this site works like other Stack Exchange sites but with a few
  differences we find work best for our culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Link some icon or menu thing on the top of each page to that page and… Done! A quick way to understand why a site might be different from core Stack Exchange sites.</p>

<p>Now I am using “Science Fiction and Fantasy” as my example here but I can easily see this being useful for some of the other, smaller, more focused Stack Exchange sites.</p>

<p>To my mind, the overall user experience is visually and functionally so similar across all of the sites that when differences appear in basic tool usage, it leads to confusion and potential conflict. Instead of relying on the community to constantly letting users know about “unwritten rules” of usage, why not just be transparent and clear about these differences from the beginning with some very clear and site-moderator manageable tool that allows them to summarize these differences.</p>

<p>It seems that simple functionality like this would be a big plus to the smaller sites as well as the casual users who just want to participate lightly without finding out that “ZOMG! I don’t believe you said/did since we are not like Stack Overflow so don’t think this thing is treated this way!”</p>

<p><strong>I believe being very clear about these differences will lead to better content from casual users which benefits everyone in the long run.</strong> If the barrier of entry to a smaller community is risking stepping on tripwires casual user’s don’t know exist, it will simply alienate them from even casual interaction.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>NOTE/UPDATE:</strong> I have discovered—for example of one site—the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/tour"">“tour” page for the “Science Fiction and Fantasy” site</a> thanks to a comment, but honestly this is not obvious, you have to hunt for it and I dare anyone to look at the “tour” content for “Science Fiction and Fantasy” and find anything past superficial, bureaucratic “glad handing.” A page like that with the wording it has and it’s non-prominent placement comes off as some kind of a disposable afterthought; reminds me of a pamphlet that comes with a set of headphones that gets discarded after you open the package. I doubt most users ever see or read that “tour” content. Perhaps the “tour” page simply needs to be made more prominent and clearly address some deeper site-specific differences? Like I said, I embrace the idea there are differences. But they really need to be made clearer and at a high level in many cases.</p>

<p>And look at the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/tour"">tour page text for the “Science Fiction and Fantasy” site</a>; the broad statement is that “Science Fiction and Fantasy” is not a “discussion forum” and “there’s no chit-chat.” Really? Is that really accurate to what a smaller site like “Science Fiction and Fantasy” is?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This site is all about <strong>getting answers</strong>. It's not a discussion
  forum. There's no chit-chat.</p>

<p>Immediately granting association bonus carries certain risk of destructive impact (comments and votes) from users totally unfamiliar with site topics, norms and culture.</p>

<p>I think it makes good sense to ignore this risk at beta sites which struggle for existence and attention and are desperate for any feedback, especially positive one (upvotes).</p>

<p>But graduated sites have no such need in indiscriminate feedback and upvotes from passers by.</p>

<p>These sites have already proven their ability to sustain and have formed core groups of active users involved in maintaining and curating content. For these sites, it doesn't make sense to ignore mentioned risks.</p>

<p>Given above, suggest to delay granting association bonus at graduated sites until at least after 2-3 <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/visited-days"" title=""Stack Exchange sites keep count of visited days, it is shown (privately) to users in their profiles"">days visited</a>. <em>Want to participate? stick with us (for at least a day or two).</em></p>

"280689","Possible Flaw in Reputation System (Moderation/Downvoting/Editing)","<p>So as a new user, I'm trying to find a balance between supplying useful answers, getting help that I need, and also trying to raise my reputation at the same time.</p>

<p>A really bad experience, and a really incredibly ""good"" experience, today has led me to believe that the ranking or reputation system for Stack Exchange in general, while it's needed and provides that anti-Yahoo Answers community, is keeping some other users down. For instance, <strong>any issues we may have with the community <em>(such as this post)</em>, we could certainly talk about it in a blog, but we don't have the rep for doing that</strong>.</p>

<p>My bad experience today was asking a simple Identify this movie question in the Movies Exchange. Although there is a <a href=""https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/bad-policing-and-constant-down-voting-of-questions-with-the-identify-this-movie"">meta question</a> about what makes such questions good or bad, there seems to be this grey line. Apparently, we should be spending our time searching on other sites rather than ask the community what kind of movie we're looking for, says one of the answers to this meta question. However, given <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/56170/what-is-this-movie-that-includes-bugs-coming-out-of-jewels-gems-and-eating-peopl/56171#56171"">my question</a>, I tried to find my movie online afterwards and couldn't get a result. So while we <em>could</em> spend our time on Google looking for our movie, I believe the point of the community is to help give members the answers (and the first answer was what I was looking for). Thus, because of my ""lack of details"" and the supposed belief that I could simply look on Google, my answer got downvoted to the point where I lost all my rep on the Movies Exchange. Call it a personal problem, but moderators (and I've noticed this in the Sci-fi section as well) are (my opinion, but there may be other reasons) either very picky or very lazy to edit/correct posts, and just downvote or close or put the questions on hold.</p>

<p>My ""good"" experience was simply working on Stack Overflow. I find it incredibly easy to gain reputation simply by editing posts, particular those with bad grammar. While this seems ""great"", we know many of these edits may not have been necessary.</p>

<p>So what is the point of reputation if I can exploit certain parts so easily and yet it seems like a waste of time to do (given the amount of downvoting due to lack of moderation)?</p>

But I'm looking for less of a discussion and more of a clear-cut answer I can use to explain something good on the internet to my jaded friends.</p>

<p>Recently Internet rage and trolling has reached new levels of relevance in people's lives. But Stack Exchange remained untouched (as far as I can see). Questions that on politicised topics could kick up flamewars elsewhere were still met with thoughtful and respectful answers and comments. There is oversight and regulation by peers and advanced members that enables the content to remain relevant to the question asked. The system also appears to stimulate a respectful attitude towards people that get the facts wrong trying their best to answer questions.</p>

<p>The incentivised peer review system is meant to improve the quality of the knowledge being shared and generated, but some may feel their point of view is being ""suppressed"" by it. On the internet that could be a reason for a system to be discredited when it reaches mainstream popularity. This might not be an issue when the topic is software development, but now that we have SE sites for politics and religions, this might become an issue.</p>

<p>I think it makes sense to improve cross community interaction!</p>

<p><strong>One half of this</strong> would be to implement a way to have a single question shared by multiple communities (which was discussed some time ago: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5790/allow-cross-posting-of-questions-to-more-than-one-so-site#comment692314_53759"">Allow cross-posting of questions to more than one SO site</a>).</p>

<p>For example on a security related question about <strong>macos</strong> the following sites <strong>all</strong> overlap (depending on the specific question) but on <strong>SO</strong> there are 30 to 1 as many users (or worse).</p>

<ul>
<li>SO (6,000,000 users)</li>
<li>Apple.se (153,000)</li>

<p>Looking at those numbers, as a <strong>question asker</strong> to get the best results it seems to make sense to post your question on SO rather than on any of the others.</p>

<p>My guess is that this relation only grows in numbers over time.</p>

<p><strong>The other half</strong> would be to implement a way to browse questions from multiple communities.</p>

<p>As a <strong>question answerer</strong>, who in my case is a programmer (SO) that mostly works on mac (Apple.se, Unix.se) and is interested in Security &amp; Cryptography I have to browse all 5 sites for questions that I can answer. </p>

<p>My idea would be, making this money somehow dependent from the growth/shrink rate of their sites.</p>

<p><em>I think, the SE has likely many internal stats (using also the data unavailable for ordinary mortals on the SEDE), making them possible to make real quality measurements. This data is unavailable also for the mods, however, the CMs could advice the mods, what to do, to optimize them.</em></p>

"305872","Duplicates on meta sites - sum the votes","<p>Duplicates are there mostly to tell us that a question was already asked and, in some cases, it also has an answer and to link to this question.</p>

<p>While this is great for main sites, on meta it's a bit trickier.</p>

<p>We know that on meta we:</p>

<ul>
<li>discuss various topics</li>
<li>propose various features</li>
<li>ask for support </li>
<li>and report bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also know that on meta, voting is not working the same as on the main sites.
Here, it represents that others agree and supports that (or not, in case of downvotes).</p>

<p>So, when we meet a duplicate on meta, it actually means that somebody else who didn't find the original post <strong>agrees and supports</strong> the same question and that whoever upvoted / downvoted the duplicated question, also agrees/disagrees with original post.</p>

<p>However, if I'm not totally wrong here, those votes are lost - we only know there's a duplicate when we visit the duplicate question. The original question doesn't show that in any way in the UI.</p>

<p>So...:</p>

<ol>
<li>We should show, in the original question, that the same thing was requested in other words;</li>
<li>We should sum the total of upvotes/downvotes, in the original question, and display them in the UI broken down per each duplicated question</li>
</ol>

<p>But why not sum the votes directly you ask? Why show them broken down per duplicated question?</p>

<p>Well... having full transparency as to how the voting occurred might be relevant when making the final decision (e.g. <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-something"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-something&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-something</a>), and might help others to agree/disagree by seeing other points of view that are considered duplicates, and how others perceived them.</p>

<p>Obviously the linkage and summing the total votes needs to be validated, so that if the same person upvotes all duplicates / upvotes one and downvotes the other, the total votes is still consistent and reliable.</p>

<p>To that end, I would simply show latest vote from a distinct person.</p>

"306974","Is Stack Exchange becoming more focused on funny or entertaining content rather than actual useful information?","<p>It feels like Stack Exchange has basically turned into Reddit in a way. With a lot of SEs like Workplace.SE, Academia.SE, IPS.SE, Worldbuilding.SE, etc. </p>

<p>These SEs are used mostly to kill time/read entertaining things rather than actually get answers. If you look at the popular questions on some of these they are completely indistinguishable from trolling.</p>

<p>For example there's one on Workplace.SE right now where a guy talks about someone eating 75 McDonalds hamburgers. I mean come on - it's obviously a troll question but even if it was real what useful information is this providing to anyone? This question is not at all unique either.</p>

<p>A lot of these questions seem to be pretty far from the mission of SE which is expert answers to questions. They seem to be more like Reddit, just to kill time. </p>

<p>Is SE becoming like Reddit?</p>

<p>Note: My point isn't about whether or not the question was a troll. More specifically my point is that the reason for those questions to become popular seems to be that people are viewing/upvoting them because they're funny or entertaining, NOT because they believe there's some useful information coming from it.</p>

"309988","We should consider adding a 'cost' to comments","<p>One of the reasons comments are so tempting is they are free. There's little risk of downvotes or upvotes, and folks often use them for things they're not meant for.</p>

<p>A few proposals I've heard have been about limiting comments per day or actually <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/302019/can-we-add-a-reputation-penalty-to-comments-that-are-removed-for-being-rude-or-a"">adding a reputation cost</a>.</p>

<p>Been considering an alternate approach - we want folks to clean up after themselves, and prioritise what comments they want to keep - and having a <em>finite</em> number of comments, sitewide would encourage users to clean up after themselves.</p>

<p>There are a potentially few nice additions here. It's an <em>invisible</em> cost - and with a sufficiently high number, many users might not notice. When you run out of comments, either you think about it harder, or go back and delete old comments. You can also adjust it - with penalties on overall comment count for accepted negative flags or increases for say higher reputation.</p>

<p>It gives people the freedom to post transient comments as needed, and gives them an enticement to remove them once done.</p>

<p>And there's a certain poetry in <em>restricting</em> the total number of comments, over other means to deal with accepted R/A flags. It also leaves some room for tweaking, if we felt it was too restrictive.</p>

<p>One issue I forsee is folks may suddenly find they hit the limit, which would be bad, and probably require some assistance for them to clean up but with a high enough limit, it might be less of an issue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it implicitly forces users to decide on the value of their past comments.</p>

"311139","For better quality: Block early answers","<p>This is a feature request that addresses the problem (at least on Math.SE) that low-quality questions are often quick-shot answered while the closing votes are still piling up. This often makes several quality problems out of one, given that there has been so little time for composing an answer.</p>

<p>To address such problems, simply <strong>block early answers</strong>. In detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>for the first, say, 20 minutes (configurable per site)
that a question is publicly visible (outside special queues),
no answers to it can be submitted.
Even at the API level, the server rejects attempts to post answers.
Everything else, be it voting, flagging, comments, edits, or moderation,
is not hindered.</li>
<li><p>During that period, the ""post an answer"" button on the question page
gets replaced with a message such as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is recent; it cannot receive answers yet.
  You can vote on it, or help improve the question by commenting or editing
  where appropriate.
  You can also prepare an answer to be posted if the question gets opened.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>No countdown-to-acceptance is displayed, because such a thing would suggest
that speed is of the essence, which is against the goal of setting the
focus on quality.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor functionality (textarea plus preview) for entering an answer
is left intact. <em>Addendum: This includes the auto-saving of drafts,
so users can still prepare and preview an answer and return later.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that answers, as opposed to questions, already have this property,
even permanently:
You can vote on them, and improve them with comments or edits,
but you cannot <em>answer an answer</em>, and that is a good thing here.
Basically, this drives users to rate the content that is already there,
instead of adding to the existing chaos.</p>

<p>The intended effects of this feature are</p>

<ul>
<li>More attention to the question itself, and more focus on its quality</li>
<li>More time to close bad questions without collateral damage in the form of
already-posted answers</li>
<li>More time for early spotters to compose a decent answer, knowing that they cannot be outrun by the competition as long as the block is in effect.</li>
<li>Nice side effect: Real-time support for exam questions is slowed down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tuning the duration of the early answer block period may require experimentation.
In the range of small values, an increase of the early block duration should
correlate directly with an increase in quality.
For longer durations, perhaps 30 minutes and above, that correlation should disappear.</p>

<p>Related topics: On Meta.Math.SE, there is a discussion about <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28376/"">rate-limiting answerers</a>.
I think that an early answer block might be more effective and less intrusive.</p>

"311397","Why do people persist in complaining about the code of conduct set for this network?","<h3>TL;DR:</h3>

<p>With so many platforms that provide chat rooms for people that can be made private, why do people persist in complaining about the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice"">code of conduct</a> set for this network?</p>

<hr>

<p>This post is for anyone using or interested in using these sites. Whether they actively participate or passively search and read. </p>

<h1>What is Stack Exchange?</h1>

<p>Stack Exchange is a question and answer site, that strives to be a repository of good information. Better than average. We have expectations on the quality of the content on the network and the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/why-vote"">whole design of the system</a> is to ensure good content is highly visible and poor content is buried of deleted. <strong>Disclaimer</strong> This can be argued up hill and down dale, but suffice to say it's the basic ethos of the site.</p>

<p>It is run by the community for the community and overseen by staff who moderate (mostly) meta activity and direct the site, as owned by a  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/company"">company</a>.</p>

<h2>Site expectations</h2>

<p>There is an expectation of a minimal level of skill when using the site. Part of this skill involves understanding how to navigate through a dynamic website and being able to refer to the help center. </p>

<p>The other is the comprehension of how to behave in a mixed society. A mixed society containing people of all ages above 13 (16 in the EU), gender, race, religion and education. A cross section of any society in a <em>public setting</em>, not  boardroom, a pub or private home.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>There's been a <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/welcoming?sort=votes&amp;pageSize=50"">great upheaval</a> recently on Stack Overflow due to this blog, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"">Stack Overflow Isn’t Very Welcoming. This has had an effect across the network. It’s Time for That to Change</a>. People react to change, but in essence the site has  had a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/be-nice-policy"">be nice policy</a> for some years, it's now <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/309645/were-more-aggressively-enforcing-self-moderation-in-chat"">moderating this more seriously</a>.</p>

<h2>Online culture</h2>

<p>There's an increasing propensity for online <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.009"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exhibitionism</a> and online communities are <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.022"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">complex</a>, which would, in part, account for the problems faced by the network, it's not unique to the network. It does mean the network is battling these growing trends, but this doesn't mean the network needs to lower the bar on what is decent behaviour.</p>

<h1>What is Stack Exchange not?</h1>

<h2>Stack Exchange is not an online social network.</h2>

<h2>Stack Exchange is not a tutorial or teaching service.</h2>

<p>People are not paid to answer questions or help people on the site. There is an exception of employees that are on hand to assist with the meta activities of the network, all else is volunteered.</p>

<h1>Participating on the sites</h1>

<h2>Chatrooms and online social network culture</h2>

<p>This post started with responding to chat flags and the level of bullying in the room to stop people from flagging comments. So this is in part a follow up to this post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/309645/were-more-aggressively-enforcing-self-moderation-in-chat"">We&#39;re more aggressively enforcing self-moderation in chat</a> and the answer I posted <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/309645/were-more-aggressively-enforcing-self-moderation-in-chat/309830#309830"">here</a> where I defended that each room was entitled to their culture. </p>

<p>I've tightened my stance on chat flags. There's plenty of avenues where people can gather and chat privately. The Stack Exchange Network provides people with chat rooms and they feel entitled to moan and complain about the very network that is providing them with the chat room, for free, no ads, nothing.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/42947100#42947100"">message below</a> is currently pinned in a chat room that gets many flags and the users then complain and rubbish the site. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a public chat room, provided by the Stack Exchange network. If
  you want to communicate in ways that breaches the ToS use another chat
  service to meet. If something is so crude or insulting that you can't
  say it out loud in a shopping centre, or high school class room, you
  can't say it here. This site is for 13 years old and up. So quit
  swearing and blaming others for flagging what goes on in here, the
  site and mods. We are responding to flags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If  people hate it so much that adult behaviour is expected from them,  maybe, just maybe, they have the problem, not the site. The site doesn't pretend to be an online social network. That's not what we're here for. We're not here to provide people with a platform to rubbish the site or any cause for that matter. We do tolerate a lot of off topic content in chat and encourage people to get along and enjoy themselves, without filth and insults. Why is this so hard?</p>

<p><strong>Repeat:</strong> Stack Exchange is not an online social network.</p>

<h2>Unjustified outrage</h2>

<p>Some people, both new users and regular users, are  outraged. There is a sense of <a href=""https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2014.0234"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">entitlement</a> amongst many people that extends beyond the bounds of reasonable behaviour and expectations.</p>

<p>""<em>Oh it's infringing on freedom of speech! It's controlling!!</em>"" Well this isn't a democracy, state or entity that has a bill of rights, this network is entitled to enforce it's own standards (complying to the relevant laws applicable for such a site). This site is allowed to set parameters on behaviour and posts. </p>

<p>People are offended when their posts are downvoted. People are offended and upset when their comments are flagged. People are up in arms everywhere. </p>

<p>Well there's two things people need to remember.</p>

<h3>1. Each individual is responsible for their own conduct and learning.</h3>

<p>You cannot blame others for your own bad behaviour. If someone doesn't agree with you. If they flag your posts or comments, if they're rude to you, if they post a crappy question.. flag it, downvote it, close vote it, walk away. There's not excuse to be rude. It's arrogant to assume it's ok to demean people. </p>

<p>The flip side. If you do little research or don't read the help center, don't be upset if your post is rejected. Each person is responsible for their own learning journey. The people on the site are not responsible for another person's lack of comprehension or struggles. We may be able to help, if you're able to articulate that problem into a clear, answerable question, suitable for the site. It's not ok to abuse people who ask for clarification in an attempt to help you.</p>

<h3>2. Society has rules and consequences for breaking those rules.</h3>

<p>Life doesn't give you a participation award. In adult life, you don't get the promotion, the great job unless you're qualified. People are critiqued. This doesn't mean it's ok to insult people, if you insult people, expect to get feedback. We all need to accept feedback. We are social creatures. Unless you plan to live as a hermit, you will receive feedback. Drive badly, you will get honked. Post a lousy question, you will get downvotes and comments on how to improve it. Post an abrasive or sarcastic remark, expect flags.</p>

<p>This network is not responsible for the personal growth or feelings or anyone. The network is bending over backwards to appease everyone and make the site as accessible to as many people as possible. <em>BUT</em> there comes a point where a line needs to be drawn and the network's responsibility is on one side of that line and the users' is on the other.</p>

<p>If people are unable to conduct themselves in a manner fit for general society, they're going to have great difficulty in relating to superiors in the workforce or educational institutions. Society has structure and respect is expected in many places. This is not a philosophical discussion on the pros and cons of most societies, it's just a fact. </p>

<p>So, why do people persist in complaining about the code of conduct set for this network?</p>

"311700","How might we solve the 50 reputation comment limit?","<h1>The problem of sub 50 rep users being unable to comment is well documented</h1>
<p>Many sub 50 rep users have complained about the problem of not being able to comment under the limit. I am one of them. A small sample of these complaints can be found <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/164035/how-does-a-lurker-gain-reputation-to-receive-privilege-for-commenting"">here</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66140/whats-the-justification-for-the-commenting-reputation-requirement?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">here</a>, and <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/252133/50-reputation-points-to-make-comments"">here</a>.</p>
<h1>The rationale for the 50 rep limit is good: reduce spam</h1>
<p>As evidenced by many of the answers to those questions, the problem that this limit is trying to solve is that of spam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The justification is simple: we don't want the site to be flooded by comments from passers-by. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66141/394174"">ЯegDwight</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The canonical answer to this question is found <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214174/394174"">here</a>. Because it does such a good job of summarizing the points, I'll quote it directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, history and experience have shown that the downsides of allowing everyone to comment are far greater than a few useful comments lost:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are big problems with spam. Automated filters cannot catch all of it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even among the real comments, most would either say &quot;I have the same problem&quot; or &quot;I agree&quot;. Such comments do not add any value, and have to be manually removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comments are very painful to moderate. Stack Exchange sites have a process of community moderation (voting, flagging, review queues) that works great for questions and answers, but not so much for comments. Comments cannot be downvoted or closevoted, nor searched (nor do we want that).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comments are second class citizens on the Stack Exchange network, not designed to hold information for all eternity. They may get cleaned up at any time. Generally, truly important information should be incorporated into an answer anyway (either by posting a new answer, if the information answers the question at least partially, or by editing an existing answer, if the information is a minor complement or clarification of that answer).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, we need a solution that reduces spam and maintains the site's goal of high quality information. In partial opposition to the quality goal is the goal of effectively on-boarding new users. We want new-users because we believe the average lifetime contributory value of a new-user is non-negative.</p>
<h1>The 50 rep limit is not good for new users</h1>
<p>The purposes of comments are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Request clarification from the author;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leave constructive criticism that guides the author in improving the post;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add relevant, but minor or transient information to a post (for example, a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problems introduced by the 50 rep limit are these:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A new-user is not be able to ask the clarifying question they have on the answer they have found</p>
</li>
<li><p>A new-user cannot add clarifying information which could help a future user</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>#1</strong> is bad for the user, <strong>#2</strong> is bad for the site</p>
<h1>&quot;But it's easy to get 50 reputation&quot;</h1>
<p>The very common response to this problem is that it is easy to get 50 reputation points. Here's how to do it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Correcting the grammar of either questions or answers. To do so, click the edit link by the entry. Rephrase poorly expressed needs. For many, English is not their native tongue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Answer questions. Each time another member upvotes your answer you receive 10 rep.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/164042/394174"">Paraphrase of Andrew C's answer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To simplify Andrew's and other people's recommendations: <strong>#1</strong> <strong>edit</strong> and <strong>#2</strong> <strong>answer</strong> so that you earn the rep you need. It's easy.</p>
<p>However, both solutions fail under scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Editing is a limited option and non-trivial</strong></p>
<p>Editing, while an option for native speakers, is not really an option for non-native or poorly educated speakers. Presumably, we'd like to avoid discriminating against users based on English mastery. This leaves only number <strong>#2</strong> as an option to those people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 25 edits needed to reach the 50 rep limit are not nothing. If it takes only 20 minutes each, that means over 8 hours of editing to reach the limit. It certainly takes me more than 20 minutes on average to edit an answer because I want to make sure the edit balances between substantive, without changing the original meaning of the author. Effective editing is also predicated on <em>prior knowledge</em> which brings me to the problems with option <strong>#2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Question answering has many barriers to entry</strong></p>
<p>It's a question/answer site, how hard can it be?</p>
<p>Stack Overflow is known for having stringent guidelines for what constitutes acceptable answers, deviating from those guidelines can result in reputation hits. To avoid breaking rules, there is significant <em>prior knowledge</em> required about the site. By definition, new-users don't have that prior knowledge. The intro-tutorial only gets them so far (and only up to 10 rep). This dearth of context reduces a new-user's confidence in their ability to participate. Anecdotally: it did for me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, answering a question requires not only information about what constitutes a good answer, but also <em>an answer to the question being asked</em>. New users are disproportionately more likely to be new programmers, therefore their ability to answer questions is much much lower. To demonstrate how I felt as a new user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I touched programming for the first time about 9-12 months ago. Only in the last 2-3 months has my level of competence reached the degree where I can provide valuable answers. In other words, [answering questions on tags like] <code>php</code> and <code>docker</code> have not been available to me as options, because until recently I knew nothing.</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/369261/7872793"">a comment I made on this answer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets worse. Not only are new-users nervous about messing up how they answer questions, while having less to provide in terms of an answer, they're also handicapped in terms of their ability to collect information in order to answer the question well. They cannot comment for clarification.</p>
<p>Consider this quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make requests for clarification, or mere responses to other answers, you need to wait until you have the comment privilege.</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214174/394174"">community wiki</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there are ways to get around it (see &quot;But I can't write a good answer without more information!&quot; in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214174/394174"">community wiki</a>), there is no denying that a new user is at a disadvantage in this respect.</p>
<p>In short, it is not easy to get to 50 reputation points. It is much harder to get from 0 to 50 rep than it is to go the next 50 to 100 rep. Just look at a couple of users' reputation graphs; they frequently follow a non-linear trajectory.</p>
<h1>This is a problem that can be solved</h1>
<p>There are certainly <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/303487/this-will-be-an-answer-answering-and-clarifying-questions-as-50-rep-users"">bad solutions to this problem</a>.</p>
<p>There are also workarounds that are not acceptable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I put my comment in an answer?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214174/394174"">community wiki</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there <em>are</em> some off-the-cuff ideas from high rep users that garner support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was never a fan of the 50 point threshold. My two cents would be to allow &lt;50-rep users to comment, but if any &gt;1,000-rep user flag their comments, then the 50 point threshold gets put in-place instantly.

<p>The minimum reputation limit for commenting on Stack Overflow is intended to prevent spam and noise. Stack Overflow is constantly attacked by spammers and trolls, so some safeguards are needed. We don't have a similar reputation requirement for questions and answers, because we have moderation tools that help us identify and remove spam and undesirable content coming in via those post types.</p>
<p>The minimum reputation requirement for people to leave comments is a constant source of frustration for new or less active users. People find something factually wrong or in need of correction in an answer, and they don't want to go and have to spam answers to get enough reputation just to comment. Many turn to leaving answers (since they don't have a reputation requirement), which then clutters up the site and wastes our time in cleanup.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to think about relaxing this, contingent on proper tools being made available to moderate comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we solve the problem of the 50 reputation comment limit?</p>
<p>To steal from Brad,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Solving this problem] would both reduce user frustration and clutter from non-answers that come in every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>A note about my reputation</h1>
<p>My low reputation is my credibility on this matter. This is a frustration that I have been dealing with since I signed up for Stack Overflow a little over 1 year ago. What finally provoked my frustration was a scenario where I needed the version number of a program that someone had used in an answer; I couldn't ask them about it. My solution was to download every version of that program and run their code until I could replicate their error to verify the version number. One comment would have circumvented that ordeal. That's untenable.</p>
<p>I expressed my frustration <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/369261/7872793"">in this thread</a>. I'm grateful to <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"">halfer</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/8534008/gblodgett"">GBlodgett</a> for their editing and suggestions.</p>
<p>I'm now above the 50 rep threshold, but I'm unwilling to abandon this issue. I'm concerned that this is the type of problem where people with influence and the capacity to make change are unaffected and therefore unmoved. I hope I have managed to convey the problem, a potential solution, and at the very least manifested a conversation worth having.</p>

<h1>Example 1</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been moved to chat.</p>

<p>This message is direct and impersonal to the point of rudeness.  It isn't really an explanation; it's a rebuke.</p>
<h1>Example 2</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>closed as primarily opinion-based by [users] [date] at [time]</p>
<p>Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise.</p>
<p>If this question can be reworded to fit the rules in the help center, please edit the question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't as rude as the comment message, but it's pretty impersonal, especially with the passive voice in the last sentence.  It could be more polite.</p>
<p>Maybe there are better examples than the above two.  I'm proposing we have the discussion.  Are we encouraging politeness with mod messages and system messages?  Can we do better?</p>

<p>The second is longer, to be sure.  It's also friendlier and more entertaining to read, and I'll bet a lot more people read the release notes of Slack than the release notes of software that uses the first style.  These release notes have a personality.</p>

<p>I have wanted to post something like this at least since I saw a staff member drop all the way to one reputation on the basis of one poorly-received announcment, but thought that it is about time to do so with the recent posting of the above question.</p>

<p>Reputation on a Stack Exchange site is supposed to represent how helpful a person has been to the community. This matters for ordinary users and even elected moderators (who ""answer"" for their behavior both to the community and to the company).</p>

<p>This idea breaks down when it comes to staff posts on Meta Stack Exchange - a staff member's primary goal is not to be helpful to or provide value to the community, but to dutifully enact the orders given to them by the company. For that reason, let us allow (but not requre) staff to ""opt-out"" of reputation tracking at least here on Meta Stack Exchange. Their reputation could be locked at an appropriate amount, tracked silently ""behind the scenes"", or simply not stored at all, but regardless, it <em>would not be displayed</em>. It would probably be replaced with some sort of ""Staff"" designation, and could include recognition of achievements related to their role, such as employee awards they have received or their latest employee performance evaluation statistics.</p>

<p>I would wish to say that we could expect staff to find the best of both worlds - to make all announcements they need to do as staff but only in ways acceptable to the community, but I know that is not really realistic. The alternative is to push the idea of a reputation ""hit"" out of the minds of staff so that they can concentrate on their work, and also to discourage members of the community from judging the staff member based on their rep.</p>

<p>A staff flair might look something like this:</p>

<p>It would seem that  under the laws of New York, where the company resides, utilising a volunteer or unpaid workforce is contravening the law. It seems moderators should be paid a minimum wage.</p>

"337334","What was the reasoning behind the deletion of this comment?","<p>Right off the bat I'm going to make it clear that I know full well that comments are ephemeral, transient, and <code>&lt;third-word-here&gt;</code>. This question is more focused on the fact that a comment, which supposedly had something wrong with it was removed, yet when attempts to understand the reasoning behind the removal were made (for future references), no helpful information was provided.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/337182/if-someone-is-hurt-by-a-literary-reference-should-it-be-removed"">If someone is hurt by a literary reference, should it be removed?</a> under my answer, I replied to a comment posted by another user directed at me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@user So, essentially, '<em>My way or highway</em>' - Glad to see how you're willing to discuss opposing points of views. The fact that you think using the poem in a different context other than the context of the holocaust is offensive shows that you don't understand poems and their interpretation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> Yes, there was initial sarcasm in the comment because I was originally under the impression that user in question was simply unwilling to hear out another opinion and were being dismissive as a result, but, other than that, I don't see anything worth the removal of this comment)</p>

<p>Today, I noticed that it had disappeared which seemed quite odd. So I flagged my answer with the following note: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why was my comment to this [removed direct link to comment for the purpose of this post] comment removed? Please either reinstate the comment or delete the comment I was replying. You're are removing context for no reason and it doesn't help anybody. This sort of moderation is what gets us into these issues.<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and to my surprise, the flag was declined with a canned response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>declined - a moderator reviewed your flag, but found no evidence to support it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I'm very much aware that a custom reply can be given by mods because I have previously been in situations where a custom reply helped me understand the reasoning behind a moderators action. So, I flagged it again with the following thoughts in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I had done something wrong, then I'd be told what I'd done wrong and learn from it so it can be avoided in the future and we could all move on</li>
<li>Or, if the mod had misunderstood the comment then I could clarify and again, we could move on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great, right?</p>

<p>The accompanying flag note I left was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't see how it's fair that this comment isn't deleted. I don't want to keep flagging<sup>2</sup> nor do I wish to make meta post<sup>3</sup> so can I be given reason for deletion of my comment that isn't canned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel that I made a fairly reasonable request, especially with the above two outcomes in mind. ~3 hours passed and I noticed that the flag had been declined, once again. Upon further inspection I was even more confused to see that no reason whatsoever had been given:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>declined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that's literally all I'd been given. So here I am writing this post.</p>

<p>With that in mind, can someone:</p>

<ol>
<li>(ideally the mod responsible) Explain to me what's wrong with my original comment (as I don't believe the person who the comment was directed towards was offended and neither was I with the overall interaction with them)</li>
<li>(the mod responsible can only answer this) Explain why the requests for more information in a scenario which would've helped either party understand their mistakes went ignored?</li>
<li>Point me to a way to discuss these sort of things without bringing it so publicly to meta?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> In hindsight, I shouldn't have added that final line as it was purely out of frustration due to the fact that recently I've been seeing comments disappear and either the context around them were left or there was nothing wrong with the comment in the first place and it was removed.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Because each decline brings me closer to a ban and it also takes mod attention away from other <em>more</em> pressing matters.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Because, really, we don't need <em>more</em> drama.</p>

"337900","Has stirring the pot reached the point of being counter productive?","<p>There are a number of on-going and recent issues that have incensed many of us--how welcoming the atmosphere is for members of the trans community, licensing, the CoC, Monica's demodding and public treatment, SOI's treatment of communities and their experienced members and moderators, apparent change in focus from content quality to feel-good, etc.  Things exploded and chaos has raged for many weeks.  People have vented in posts and comments.</p>

<p>Not much has actually changed with the underlying issues, and the indications are that SOI is entrenched in how things are.  I think we're reaching the point where ""keeping the pressure on"" is becoming counter productive.  It isn't likely to produce change from SOI, but it will start burning out people who care about the issues.  </p>

<p>People can maintain the negative emotions for only so long.  Eventually, they run out of emotional energy, give up on the issues, and either accept the way things are or move on.  When that happens, continuing to stir the pot becomes annoying and loses followers.</p>

<p>It seems like everything that can be said about these issues has been said, and repeated.  At this point, the issues are being kept alive by continually tweaking the old posts with updates and grammar fixes, and fresh posts that seem to be mostly rants or duplicates.  We need to let people emotionally recharge, or those sympathetic to the cause will start to be turned off by it.  Progress may best be served by giving things a rest, at least temporarily.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This question is not about how to solve the underlying issues.  That has been extensively discussed elsewhere, and we can certainly use new and more effective strategies.  This post is specifically about posting on Meta SE.  </p>

<p>If there is new or constructive stuff to post, by all means do it, and try to do it as factual information with a minimum of emotional charge.  However, most of the existing threads were posted when emotions were high, and the threads and comments touch a lot of raw nerves.  Continuing to rehash and bump these old posts to keep the issues in the forefront fills the main page with posts that become emotionally draining, and continue to trigger raw nerves.</p>

<p>This post is to suggest that continuing to do this may start losing us people with sympathetic views because people will become emotionally burned out by continually ""picking at the scab"".  The specific suggestion is to minimize bumping of these old posts and posting new, nearly identical questions about the same issues for the purpose of keeping the issues in the forefront.  Give people a break from the Meta SE main page being constantly filled with emotionally triggering posts, and let people recharge so they stick around to fight another day.</p>

For many users of the sites, one of their aims – besides procrastination and playing the game of gaining virtual repuation – is getting (and providing) information.

<p>I have often been in conflict between providing the best answer and following the site rules. From my experience, the site rules (and SE Inc's monetarization goal) can stand in the way of providing quick useful help.</p>

<li><p>Offsite links</p>

<p>Sometimes the best answer is an edit to a Wikipedia article and a link to it. Stealing content from another site is both illegal and immoral.</p>

<p>Offsite content such as scientific journals may also be more stable and permanent than Stack Exchange itself. The claim that only SE will be able to provide permanence on the internet is presumptuous (and probably driven by the company's interest).</p>

<p>A link may also be a means for a user to find a better answer on another site. A short summary here of a long post elsewhere may not be the best answer. In that case, a link is.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions can only have one best answer</p>

<p>For many questions there are many equally good answers. For example, the best approach to solving a parenting or writing problem will often depend on individual factors such as the personality of the person asking the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate questions</p>

<p>The more often a question has been asked and answered, the more likely it is that someone using a search engine will find one of those answers. Finding an answer when one doesn't know the appropriate technical terms or how a duplicate question has been phrased is often next to impossible. The more often a question has been asked and answered, the more likely it is that the way one individual asker searches for the answer returns a search engine result.</p></li>

"345323","Can the sites about religions have suitable background for block quotes?","<p>The usual application of quoting on most of the sites is to quote someone's sayings. It can be conversation, articles, webpage, newspaper or books etc. Now if we talk about sites about religions, every religions have some sacred/holy texts (called scripture e.g. bible for Christianity) on which we can say whole the religion may be based on. In other words we can say those texts are believed to be highest authority for concepts and practice of particular religion. </p>

<p>So, while answering questions on religion sites, experts do cite texts (usually in the poetry form called verse) from scriptures to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/167259/260388"">backup their answers</a>. This citations are considered to be authoritative/reliable sources. Thus, scriptural quote has profound significance in answering on religion sites. </p>

<p>As we know that background for block quoted text <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/343919/260388"">has recently changed</a>. The quoted text now looks as follows: (quoting a verse from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kena_Upanishad"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kena Upanishad</a> for example purpose) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ātmānaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi śarīraṁ rathameva tu ।<br>
  uddhiṁ tu sārathiṁ viddhi manaḥ pragrahameva ca ॥</p>
  
  <p>1-III-3. Know the Self to be the master of the chariot, and the body to be the chariot. Know the intellect to be the charioteer, and the mind to be the reins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn't sound like quoting scriptural text. The scriptural quotes should look like we are citing from scriptures. For example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/IBYlk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/IBYlk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here the background used is an image of blank page of old book page which matches with how ancient manuscripts look. ( see <a href=""https://archive.org/details/taitiriya-upanishad-CGV-PSS-0371-1524/page/n3/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the sample</a> for example). I think this type of background would be more suitable on religion sites.</p>

<p>So, <strong>how about having (or can we have) old-book-page type background for quoting scriptures on Christianity.SE, Judaism.SE, Hinduism.SE, Islam.SE and Buddhism.SE?</strong> </p>

<p>If this type of background looks somewhat ugly then one may design the cooler one. What I want to emphasize is ""It should look like reading an ancient sacred scripture""</p>

<p><sup>Though this is about changing background for quoted text, if possible, it would be useful if we have separate quote format for normal quote <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> (which we already have) and scriptural quote (introducing something like <code>&lt;scripturalquote&gt;</code>)</sup></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Anyway, If we can't have such a background image discussed above we can <strong><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/344874/260388"">revert to the previous yellowish background</a></strong> for religion sites.

"348593","Make it clearer that a question is self answered","<p>I have noticed that when people are asking a question just to self answer it right away, they - for very obvious reasons - does not put to much effort into the actual question. Why would they? They have a problem that they have solved and now want to share their knowledge. So the question usually ends up with just a simple ""How do I do X provided Y"" and nothing more.</p>

<p>But it's pretty common (granted, speculation from my side) that these questions gets downvoted for lack of research, which is a bit unfair. All the research exists in the answer. But if you don't know that the question is self answered, then it's quite natural to downvote it.</p>

<p>I have found two ways of guarding yourself against these misinterpreted downvotes. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add something like ""(This is a self answered question)"" to the actual question.</p></li>
<li><p>Add unnecessary research to the question just to make it look ""well researched"".</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both are suboptimal. Meta commentary is frowned upon, so there goes the first option. And just fictionally copying stuff from the answer just to show that you have made your research is not good either. One way of doing it is basically taking 90% of the answer and put it in the question, and then let the answer take care of the remaining 10% of the problem. But I cannot really see how that would make anything better. It would just make it look better.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly what would be the best solution. I'm thinking of something like a banner clearly indicating that it is self answered or something. What do you think? </p>

<p>I'm open to the thought that there may be good reasons to expand the question even if you have solved the problem, but I cannot see any.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If we should have that banner, it should be autogenerated from the site. I did not think about something that you put in the body of the question.</p>

"353169","Would it be better if bounties were NOT like ads?","<p>Based on some disappointing early experiences with bounties, I asked <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/353122/238319"">this question</a>. I'm new to Meta and didn't structure the question well for my goals, but with some help I've come away with a new suggestion for discussion which I hope better fits the mold.</p>
<h2>Pretext</h2>
<p>In <em>many</em> responses to questions and feature requests relating to bounties, we hear that <strong>bounties are like advertisements</strong> — that you are paying for exposure, and that there is no guarantee of ROI. What follows is a distillation of my thought process upon being introduced to that comparison.</p>
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>For clarity and brevity, a couple terms, some of which I may have made up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefactor:</strong> a person offering/paying a bounty (from <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/295825/535401"">here</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Bountee:</strong> a person seeking a specific bounty by answering a question</li>
<li><strong>Publisher:</strong> a StackExchange site listing a question</li>
<li><strong>Consumer:</strong> a reader/user of the site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparison to real world counterparts</h2>
<p>In the real world, bounties and advertisements are very different things.</p>
<p>A bounty:</p>
<ul>
<li>exists for the purpose of incentive</li>
<li>can be offered for as long as the benefactor wants to do so</li>
<li>can have its terms or amount changed at any time</li>
<li>costs the benefactor nothing until someone wins the bounty</li>
<li>pays the bountee, not the publisher</li>
</ul>
<p>An advertisement:</p>
<ul>
<li>exists for the purpose of visibility</li>
<li>buys a fixed amount of exposure</li>
<li>costs up front with no promise of return on investment</li>
<li>pays to the publisher, not the consumer</li>
</ul>
<p>People come to SE with an existing knowledge of the world. It would be good if that knowledge carried over smoothly into SE.</p>
<h2>StackExchange bounties are a confusing hybrid of both</h2>
<p>Given the way a bounty works today, this makes <em>some</em> sense: you have to &quot;buy&quot; being listed at the top, but you also need to incentivize potential bountees.</p>
<p>I find this conflation of the two topics to be both confusing and less than ideal: if I'm paying for exposure, why am I paying the bountee? Shouldn't I be paying the publisher? If I'm providing an incentive, why must I pay even if I never get a satisfactory answer? Those are very valid questions, and the only answer I've seen today boils down to &quot;because that's how it works.&quot;</p>
<p>From the help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of what you’re “paying for” with the bounty is to get additional attention for your question, over and beyond what a normal question gets. In that regard, a bounty does not guarantee a response, and reputation refunds are not available if no answers are received as a result of the bounty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree; it's not <em>part</em> of what you're paying for. It's <em>all</em> of what you're paying for. You might also get some upvotes or helpful answers, and the latter is almost certainly <em>why</em> you paid, but it is quite clear based on spending a couple days reading everything I can find on Meta about bounties that it is <em>not what you paid for</em>.</p>
<p>To be clear: I am not saying that the existing system is hard to understand. It's quite easy and clear. What it isn't is <em>obvious</em> or <em>intuitive</em>.</p>
<h2>I propose that bounties <em>not</em> be treated like advertisements</h2>
<p><em>I am seeking possible paths to that end, as well as discussion on the merits of my thinking.</em></p>
<p>I have a potential solution in mind. To clarify that my idea is just one of several possibilities, I'm going to post it as an answer rather than part of the question, so that people can agree/disagree independently with the problem I've outlined and the details of a proposed solution, and so that others can post their own solutions.</p>
<p>I understand that making any change along these lines would likely be nontrivial, and that the current system has been in place and working for several years. I do not feel that either of those factors is a worthwhile reason to dismiss this suggestion without discussion.</p>
<p>What do you think of this idea?</p>

"357604","Perhaps do not oblige users to read and understand your privacy policy and cookies policy?","<p>I finally reached the end of the processing of your terms and conditions. They are quite long, although they do have the advantage of applying to several useful sites.</p>
<p>One possible improvement, is to change the agreement such that it doesn't oblige users to read and understand your cookies policy and privacy policy. Such obliging occurs both in the user agreement, <strong>as well as in the homepage footer banner</strong>.</p>
<p>It appears that normally websites don't oblige users in such ways. The privacy policy—for example—is often just there for the user if he or she wishes to review it: there's often no forcing users into both the reading of it and the understanding of it.</p>
<p>These two policies (cookies policy and privacy policy) have no contractually-articulated user obligations (it appears). This often appears to be the case with such policy documents. Therefore, users don't have to restrict or change their behaviour as part of their formal obligations, in respect of these two policies of yours. They could most likely just skip reading them without hurting their compliance with your user agreement, apart from the compliance to your insistence that users read and understand these policies.</p>
<p>If it takes a user one hour to read these two policy documents, and you have 100,000 users, that will end-up being 100,000 man-hours spent on reading these two policy documents, which could be an awful waste of resources. And that's being quite optimistic in respect of the time it takes to read them.</p>
<p>I advise you not to oblige users to read these two documents, both in order to reduce wastage by your userbase, as well as to improve your product and service offerings.</p>

"292545","Does the Stack Exchange suppress the personality of moderators?","<p>After communicated with a lot of a moderators, I've found a pattern.</p>
<p>I've got an impression, that despite their diamond-like position, they are in the reality oppressed. The reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are very careful before mentioning any non-public information even in the cases if it is perfectly irreal (for example, they do this even if it is my own data, for which he has access).</li>
<li>They talk as little as possible. If they talk, they prefer citing rules or public information.</li>
<li>They don't like to say anything about their opinion. It seems as if they wouldn't have opinion from anything, only rules to follow.</li>
</ol>
<p>My general impression is that they need to follow so many rules so carefully, that practically nothing remains, what they could do on their own free will.</p>
<p>As I can remember, the SE estimates the daily work need of the modship around 1 hour, which is a significant part of their lifetime.</p>
<p>My impression is that the life of a mod is essentially a continuous fight for making the chance of his de-modding as low as possible. And they sacrifice nearly all of their freedom in this fight.</p>
<p>Is it possible, that a mod has an idea, how can they make a site better, and he simply realizes it?</p>
<p>It is possible, that a mod thinks somebody is an a***e and he simply says it? Or he has to wait until this person commits something which is enough for a mod warning? I think, the first is much better.</p>
<p>And, here is another problem. And this is that the argumentation between a mod and a non-mod is heavy, the non-mod can take some &quot;risky&quot; things. The mod can't. Which results that the people can even a insult them and they must permit it. To me, if I talk with one, it is a much more motivation to remain polite that he is not allowed to attack back, as his mod powers (what he can't use in the actual case).</p>
<p>If I see them, I don't see judges. I see people with an oppressed personality.</p>

"301376","Require moderator comments on declining a custom flag","<p>I suggest that moderators be required to leave a comment when declining a custom flag.</p>

<p>When flag-setters took their time to explain the reasoning behind their actions, moderators should show their respect, and reciprocate by explaining the disagreement that caused them to decline the flag. This goes beyond a simple show of respect: by explaining their reasoning, or even by linking the corresponding FAQ/meta post, moderators reduce the number of incorrect flags that would otherwise be raised in the future. The user may also stop flagging, which would lead to more garbage content left around the site.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> The comment does not need to be custom: an applicable ""stock comment"" would be perfectly sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> For flags declined through community review a ""stock comment"" should be applied automatically, for example ""Community reviewed your flag, but found no evidence to support it.""</p>

"305006","Should moderators collectively decide before deleting a question as off-topic?","<p>Many answers claim that a collective decision on subjective issues; such as what is off-topic is just a waste of time. But too often they forget that newcomers are often clueless about what is considered off-topic and which site they can post their question. As a result, often, newcomers submit the same question on more than one SE site, which leads to a greater loss of time for regular users and mods alike as they try to sort out the confusion. After that, many users come to Stack Exchange Meta to ask where can they post. In fact, there is a site recommendation tag for that very purpose: <a href=""/questions/tagged/site-recommendation"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;site-recommendation&#39;"" rel=""tag"">site-recommendation</a></p>

<p>Obviously, moderators are human beings and everyone has a different opinion on subjective matters, i.e. what is on-topic or not. This means that users may go to multiple sites and have discussions with multiple site moderators which leads to discussions, feelings of resentment, frustration, and still with no clear idea where to post their question. </p>

<p>However, if the moderators could, collectively, take a decision on subjective matters, it would avoid <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_validation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">subjective validation</a>, save time, energy and be helpful to everyone.</p>

<p>As an example, Server Fault had a discussion to not allow questions on panels in April 2015. But the links given to me by the Webmasters moderator justifying why panel questions are suitable for Server Fault clearly show that Server Fault moderators are allowing questions on panels even after April 2015:</p>

<p><a href=""https://serverfault.com/search?q=centos+web+panel"">https://serverfault.com/search?q=centos+web+panel</a>
<a href=""https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/digital-ocean?mixed=1"">https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/digital-ocean?mixed=1</a>*</p>

<p>Often on Stack Overflow sites, an off-topic question is single-handedly put on hold by one mod and then deleted by the mod. Would it not be better if 4 or 5 moderators collectively decided <strong>when to delete a post as off-topic and on subjective matters</strong>? </p>

<p>Also, when a moderator suggests an alternative SE site for posting the question, would it not be better if the mod of that site asked the other site mods whether the particular question is off-topic or not on that site?</p>

<p>I faced this precise experience when I posted a question on one site, the site admin told me that the question was off-topic and to post on another site. Which is what I did, but then the second site mod told me to post my question back to the previous site and they too, also deleted my question. The mod even gave me a link showing that the previous site had questions on that specific topic. Now, I have left that second site.</p>

<p>The reasons for wanting to do this are :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SE does not pay me and my time is valuable to me.  If SE want perfect copy then pay for it.  Certainly SE seems to plan to make money from my posts.  If SE isn't paying then surely the amount of time I am willing to devote to the process is entirely my own choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Other users can make or propose edits to my posts anyway.  If someone wants a change they can quite simply make the edit and see if it's accepted.  For users above certain reputation thresholds these edits do not even need voted approval.</p></li>
<li><p>I go on SE to help people with questions with what I (think) I know.  I do not go on SE to help SE shareholders.  Helping people is creating answers or commenting, it is not making edits to accommodate personal preferences which the members can in fact make themselves.  I am not a copy editor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The CoC Changes</strong></p>

<p>This obviously is prompted by proposed changes to the FAQ which seem intent on making me a copy editor (unpaid) for SE and propose punishing me for not do so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So can I simply add a declaration to my posts stating I reserve the right not to respond to any comments or edits ?*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this is currently allowed (before the proposed draconian changes come into effect) will I be allowed to do this after they come into effect ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, ordinary users can make edits if they wish, so why would we be forced to edit for them ?</p>

<p>DO I in fact have any right to refuse to respond to credits (from SE managements point of view) or am I now required to respond to everything.  Surely it's ""must respond to everything"" or ""can respond to nothing or what you like"".</p>

<p>We need clarification on what SE expect and will enforce.</p>

<p><em>Note : The appropriate tags for this topic are not clear to me.  I made a best guess but someone with more clarity on this feel free to correct them.</em></p>

<p>Re Pronouns : I have stated my practical objections to this policy elsewhere.  This question is not about that specific issue, but about when or if I can be held accountable for not responding to <em>any</em> comments or edits and if I can avoid being labelled as an offender by making a disclaimer.  For the record I want a common sense application of the ""be nice"" policy and expect that to include gender respect.</p>

<li>Given the number of recent moderator resignations, the remaining moderators may tend to be skewed more towards agreeing with or at least complicity with SE's actions of recent and this deletion may have been made in bias.  </li>

"343860","I suggest to consider adding a unified structure for asking questions to all STEM network sites","<p>Humbly, I have 7 years experience in the network and have asked about 1,500 questions throughout different sites in it. I have recently joined <a href=""https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/"">Medical Sciences SE</a> where I was managed to ask <a href=""https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/users/8225/johndoea?tab=questions"">37 questions</a> until getting blocked from asking more for some time; it is a site in which almost any question is closed, either by lack of <em>evidenced prior researched</em>, asking for <em>personal medical advice</em>, or both. The OP is lucky if its migrated.</p>

<p>Many of the aforementioned closings happen to new users who didn't even know about the ""draconian"" demand of <strong>evidenced</strong> <em>prior research</em> which is perhaps unique to Medical Sciences SE (due to ""evidenced"").<br>
This often brings a redundant chain of comments between very experienced users (including mods) to these new users, which could otherwise be prevented and time would have been saved for all involved.</p>

<p>From my experience in Chemistry SE, Biology SE and Psychology, Neuroscience SE, Computer Science SE, Super User SE and Unix and Linux SE, a similar problem happens there as well but not as frequent as in Medical Sciences SE.  </p>

<h2>My suggestion</h2>

<p>I suggest to consider adding a unified structure for asking questions to all <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">STEM</a> network sites, so that all such websites (such as Medical Sciences SE) will have a unified structure for associated questions such as this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Background data which includes an explanation about how this session deals with general audience and isn't a personal medical advice request or an homework solution.</p>
  
  <h2>Evidence of prior research</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>My problem</h2>
  
  <p>A problem in understanding one or more sources in evidenced prior research or of experiencing a conflict between one or more sources to one or more sources.</p>
  
  <h2>My question</h2>
  
  <p>A question based on the problem in understanding the condition
  (identical or similar to a question in title --- if there was one).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li>Isolating a problem based on prior research can prevent what is very often assumed as XY problem</li>
<li>Clearly requesting evidenced prior research will raise the change for mutual learning, will ensure good sources, will ensure more content and better SEO (if all goes right, hopefully) and will on the way prevent heresays</li>
<li>It should prevent massive amount of closings as common in life sciences oriented network sites as I have clued as well as subsequent miscommunications between very experienced users (including mods) and new users; thus it will allow the mods more time to deal with more important stuff such as COC violations, migration, merging and alike</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>Per my opinion, evidenced prior research and isolated problem to solve in understanding, aren't the perfect path for a good question but they can certainly lead in that direction.</p>

<p>One could ask how to ""access"" the usage of such ready injected template to new users and what to do with old questions.</p>

Of course rep does offer us some guidance about our posts since it comes primarily from community voting and so there isn't anything necessarily bad about asking a question that increases rep, even by users who ask questions <em>to get rep</em> of which I'm not one.</p>

<p>But I would like to ""retire"" my reputation at a symbolic 99k because that would:</p>

<ul>
<li>remove any doubt that my questions are asked for any other reason than to provide a place for great answers to be written</li>
<li>serve as a reminder that reputation is not the be all and end all of our activity here</li>
</ul>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if others wouldn't also like this option, so it might be just a button that we choose on our profile; no matter what the current rep was it would no longer be displayed at higher than 99k, or maybe replaced with a static<code>99,000</code> or <code>99,999</code> odometer-like symbol.</p>

<p>Personally I'd rather see reputation displayed as a base 10 logarithm, a bit like pH. So 500, 23,000 and 155,000 for example would be 2.7, 4.4 and 5.2 which still indicates rep to 10% accuracy but in a more calming way. I'd then opt for the 4.9 cap.</p>

For example, can Community Managers see if a candidate deleted an account in that election year? Can CMs see a deleted account's comment history? This would be especially relevant in cases where a potential candidate successfully avoided an <em>imminent</em> suspension by deleting their secondary account.</p>
<p>For example, a candidate who openly belittled and challenged the company's policy that we respect each other's identity and beliefs, as stated in the 2019 Code of Conduct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This Code of Conduct helps us build a community that is rooted in kindness, collaboration, and mutual respect.</em><br />
<strong>No bigotry</strong>.<br />
<em>We don’t tolerate any language likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion […] Use stated pronouns (when known). When in doubt, don't use language that might offend or alienate.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:<br />
Contrary to the expressed concerns of a few, this post is not about instigating a witch hunt. It is everything to do with a candidate's integrity, and honesty. If a candidate publicly expressed penitence for their disruptive and/or controversial behaviour on a secondary account then all is well.  It is important to know that future candidates acknowledge any <em>recent</em> misconduct which could have led to a suspension. After all, in theory at least, an elected mod is a life-long position. And in the case where a user mocked gender-neutral pronouns but deleted their account after receiving a warning, it would be an important signal that the handling of LGBTQ users' flags will always be fair and unbiased.</p>

"281371","An open letter to Tim Post, the community manager of Stack Overflow","<p>You asked me once if there was anything going on that I'd like to talk about.</p>

<p>One of your moderators just banned me on Stack Overflow for a month, telling me that my edits for <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/posts/38408938/revisions"">this question</a> are ""entirely out of line"", adding that they ""have no time for my games"". Probably they got confused with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/38408938/8"">this edit of mine</a>. In that edit, I wasn't masking the OP, but just <strong>copy-pasted their comment</strong> (now removed).</p>

<p>So, there is one thing that I'd like to talk about. </p>

<p>I am not asking about the alleged possibility to do anything ""out of line"" to a question that is already <em>off topic</em>. Neither is the question itself, which sounds just horrible to any PHP-er, my concern, but prejudice.</p>

<p>It is not a secret that I am not the most adored person around, thanks to my attitude towards the greed of rep-whores, the mindless ignorance of wannabe helpers and a vanity of all sorts. Given gamification is a religion, I am a sinner who spoils other people's game, judging their contribution not just by their sincere desire to help, but by the actual value.</p>

<p>Besides that, I am a pain in the back on Meta.SO, asking harsh and awkward questions there, making people think I am a black-hearted person who is deliberately spoiling their happy and cheerful existence.</p>

<p>So there are people who hate my guts. I was foolish enough before, not watching my tongue and giving them an easy cause to report me. I've learned not to engage in an argument since then. One of these people went so far as to follow after me on Reddit, and tried to slander me there. But anyway, I don't care for these people either.</p>

<p>In the end, a hater's report ends up on a moderator's desk. So my question is: what is the moderator's moral code (if any)? Should they act like an ordinary human, guided by hate, prejudice and slander? Should they act swiftly, taking no time to consider the situation? Should they be driven by a mere jealousy, thinking <em>""Whaat?! That rabble dared to revert an edit that I, a powerful mod, bothered to make? Ban him!""</em>?</p>

<p>I know, they've got not much time to waste: the requests are plenty, the mods are few, while everyone has a family, a job, a life. But if one does not understand the problem <em>and</em> has no time or desire to dig in, why intervene at all? If one is prejudiced towards someone else, why not rein that feeling in, if you act not as a private person but as an official? </p>

<p>I have been a faithful volunteer for Stack Overflow for many years, trying to make this site better; namely, trying to make it stop spreading wild superstitions and outdated practices; editing questions to make them relevant for Google searchers; awarding bounties for the questions that otherwise won't get any attention. For all that everyday work I was offered a pack of a penny-worth stuff which I didn't bother to order. So here goes my question: can I swap this offer for a right to be judged with little less brutality, prejudice and haste?</p>

<p>If (as I suppose) the answer is negative, then I've got only one thing to ask. There is a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/38255659/285587"">question</a> I set a bounty for, which ends tomorrow, and now I am unable to award it. If there is a way to make it awarded fully, I'll be very grateful. There are so few worthy questions on SO, and even fewer worthy participants, that I don't want them to be discouraged.</p>

<p>The observation attracted a number of detractors, so the OP asked that I open a new meta question about this issue, which was fine by me. The last line in my answer has since been deleted, but I have reposted it above.</p>
<p><strong>At first glance</strong>, the figures appear to have the same skin and hair color. Looking more closely, you'll notice that the thin outlines are in different shades of brown and yellow, however, the area inside those lines are left blank.  Basically, the figures <em>appear</em> to be Caucasian and either blond or white-haired (but not everyone agrees).</p>
<p>So here is the new meta post. I think it's worthy of attention and some serious discussion.</p>
<p>To save time, here's a short list of the most significant comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>To be honest adding black faces/hair into the mix wouldn't mix well with the design. It's meant to be simplistic with a lack of block colour. The approach they've used (different coloured outlines) seems to be a good way to go</em> […] <em>if they made all the skin dark they'd probably have to block colour the clothes, hair and objects to stay with the theme</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How do you infer that from the image? As far as I can see the outlines all have different (nonsensical) colors and the inside of the humans is empty? Is there something in there that indicates caucasian? Because I can't see it. Looks like some cartoon freeform human drawing akin to the nonspecificity used by cartoons like The Simpsons to me. I'm honestly having trouble reading any form of representation (caucasian or otherwise) into the varied colors of a wireframe cartoon that doesn't detail enough to even be able to ascribe ethnicity of any of the figures.[…]</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>though looking at the hairstyles in the image above, it does seem to indicate everyone there is Caucasian</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>Is the image above inclusive of ethnicities?</li>
<li>Does it matter? It's just a drawing, will anyone notice or even care?</li>

This last action results in a 1 year ban.</p>
<p>This is all a fictitious example of course.  My issue with the above example is that ever increasing punishments occur by the common guidelines compared to ever decreasing severity of infractions.  The user learned their lesson that personal attacks are not to be tolerated.  They subsided in this and committed some lesser offenses in my opinion but paid more of a price.</p>
<p>What kind of lesson does this send the user, someone who possibly has been a valuable contributor for years?  The prior history and mod annotations follow that user for the rest of their time on the site and 500 valuable answers later they may find that one small slip up results in being kicked out for a long period of time.  Why would that person be motivated to come back or help anymore?</p>
<p>It seems very similar and relevant to debates about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Three Strikes Law</a> and how <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820400095791"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it doesn't work</a>.</p>
<h2>My proposal is that the infraction should always fit the response, and that prior infractions should be no determination in the appropriate moderator action for a specific infraction.</h2>
<p>Essentially each new type of breach of the rules should give the moderator the discretion to issue ONE and only one warning.  The repeat offense should get the appropriate punishment.  If say somebody goes rage and starts defacing content with adult content, that should be an immediate harsh suspension.  If after serving that time the user never repeats that particular offense but then proceeds to contribute valuable content for a while, then has a minor &quot;skirmish&quot; with another user, then that should be a lesser but appropriate action.</p>
<p>This would result in more fair outcomes and would be a better moderator guideline for all sites.</p>

"309612","Does Stack Exchange have an ethical responsibility to address global discrimination and marginalisation?","<h3>1. Stack Exchange has a Problem</h3>

<p>There's been a <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=%5Bblog%5D%20is%3Aquestion"">commotion on Stack Overflow</a> since the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"">latest blog</a> was posted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too many people experience Stack Overflow¹ as a hostile or elitist place, especially newer coders, women, people of color, and others in marginalized groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/366665/does-stack-exchange-really-want-to-conflate-newbies-with-women-people-of-color"">Does Stack Exchange really want to conflate newbies with women/people of color?</a> (the title is self explanatory) raises some important issues. Although the blame is placed firmly at the feet of the new comers to the site posting crappy questions, in typical Stack Overflow meta style. </p>

<p>Now it comes (probably should be no surprise, as Stack Overflow is the flagship site) that this type of hostility is <a href=""https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2838/apologies-and-parting-notes"">not limited to Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>It's been receiving a lot of <a href=""https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">public attention</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/QfYwO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/QfYwO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now bear with me for the next paragraphs, this is leading to somewhere relevant to the site. </p>

<h3>2. The Blindness of Discrimination</h3>

<p>There seems to be a displaced and disturbing degree of <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/364236/what-can-we-do-to-resolve-debates-about-gender"">community outrage</a> on the Stack Overflow when Stack Exchange or any users speak about Social issues on the site. There also is a strong <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/366816/3956566"">dismissive</a> air about acknowledging that anybody on the planet does indeed suffer from discrimination, but we cannot convince nor educate everyone to take a walk in someone else's shoes and most racial discrimination,  wherever it is, is pervasive, ingrained and sickenly insidious. It's something that many people point blank do not want to deal with. In fact, I live in a country where the Aboriginal people have <a href=""https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/indigenous-health-welfare/indigenous-health-welfare-2015/contents/life-expectancy-and-mortality-key-points"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">completely different life expectancies as the rest of the country</a>, and in fact were not recognised as human beings until recent history changed that, and yet much of our country dismisses the inbuilt discrimination and disadvantaged faced by this group of people. </p>

<p>Dealing with discrimination is difficult, as human beings seem attached to the idea that if people are in a rotten position it's their fault, the world doesn't owe them a living and there's a complete and rotten blind spot in comprehending that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalized_discrimination"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">institutional discrimination</a> is actually real.</p>

<h3>3. Stack Exchange does not Exist Separately from the Rest of the World</h3>

<p>Stack Exchange does not exist as a microcosm separated from the rest of the world. It's a reflection of the world, but a shinier reflection, as we do have standards, despite the criticism, we do pretty well, considering much of the internet is basically a free for all to abuse one another. We are far from perfect and there's areas that need improvement, most of us agree with that and clearly the site is doing something about that.</p>

<h3>Does Stack Exchange have an Ethical or Social Responsibility to Address Discrimination?</h3>

<p>Clearly the network has a Be Nice policy, although it would appear that we're failing to employ that to it's best practice. So bigotry is clearly not allowed on the site. But it does beg the question.<br>
If 1, 2 and 3 are true.  Does this mean the network has a responsibility to address discrimination, as an issue in it's own right, with or without blame? </p>

<p>Does the network have a responsibility to educate the community?</p>

<p>Where is the line between what Stack Exchange does as a site and a community and social justice? </p>

<p>It's time to determine if these conversations are on topic for the site and how they're addressed if they are. Frankly, as it stands a free for all brawl on Meta Stack Overflow is not helping our public profile, it's not helping to make hesitant or burned users like participating on the site. In all honesty, management needs to take some clear control over this situation. We can live in the allusion that the site if for the community and run by the community, but this isn't the case. The company runs to make money and the bottom line and decision making ends there. Yes community consultation is a good thing, but it's time management cleared some of these areas up, before we tear each other to shreds on meta.</p>

<p><sub>For clarity, I'm not pushing one way or another for whether these discussions are on topic, I'm genuinely asking that management takes control.</sub></p>

"292012","Drop ""noisy"" comment flags from the moderator queue unless an answer has 5 or more comments","<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>There are a huge number of noisy comments, and they generate a huge number of flags. But, a large number of flags are raised on comments where they won't do very much good: if there's only a few comments on a post, removing one of them doesn't make an appreciable dent in the noise.</p>
<p>Here's a fun chart:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZDrHB.png"" alt=""% of comment flags by number of comments on a post"" /></p>
<p>The x axis is the total number of comments on a post (deleted or visible).
The yellow line is the fraction of moderator-actioned <em>obsolete</em> and <em>too chatty</em> flags raised on posts with this number of comments.
The blue line is the same, but cumulative, i.e., the fraction of such flags raised on posts with this number of comments <strong>or less</strong>.
Data is for Stack Overflow during the past 356 days.</p>
<p>As you can see, over 50% of &quot;noisy&quot; comment flags are raised on posts with 5 comments or less. On average, that's well over 100 flags every day. The raw numbers are smaller on most other sites, but the percentages are pretty much the same (with the exception of a handful of sites where pretty much any comment turns into a long discussion/argument - you know who you are).</p>
<p>Now, don't get too fixated on the numbers here; the real cost is probably a lot higher, since some folks use &quot;not constructive&quot; for literally everything and I'm not counting those. My point is simply that a majority of these flags are chewing up moderator time in situations where <em>they're not actually doing any good</em>.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>First, we need better data on this. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/292011/drop-not-constructive-combine-noisy-reword-rude-and-other-comment-flag"">Re-working the wording of comment flags</a> (and dropping redundant options) should help there.</p>
<p>But then... I suspect we can easily get away with <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/37345/should-moderators-be-able-to-see-who-flags-a-comment/37354#37354"">just ignoring</a> &quot;noisy&quot; comment flags (those that don't indicate rudeness or some other serious problem) on posts that have fewer than 5 comments in total (deleted or visible).</p>
<p>To that end, we should <em>hide these flags from the moderator flag queue</em> when there are no &quot;rude&quot; or &quot;other&quot; flags on the same post, and when the post has never had more than 4 comments on it. Focus moderators' attention on getting rid of serious problems and removing noise when it actually obscures signal. The flags can hang around until more comments are posted or until other flags are raised... Or they can hang around forever, doing no more harm than the comments themselves.</p>

The ads in question were not intending to start audio but were rather checking to see if there was an audio player present as part of a bot/fraud detection system. For those who might still be wondering about the ad code, please read below. </p>

<p>Some of our advertising clients use a third-party ad fraud service to verify their ads are running on the correct sites and to a real audience. This is a normal and standard practice for digital advertising.     </p>

<p>In this case, one company, <a href=""https://integralads.com/capabilities/ad-fraud/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Integral Ad Science</a> (IAS), is responsible for the console errors seen in dev tools.    </p>

<p>We’ve been assured by IAS that: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The console errors people have seen are normal and expected. This was confirmed by their product and engineering teams.  </p></li>
<li><p>The sca.js pixel as mentioned collects data required for ad verification. There is no individual user tracking happening as the browser signals they collect via their js does not collect any PII.  </p></li>
<li><p>Their signal collection complies with the standards of Media Rating Council (<a href=""http://mediaratingcouncil.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MRC</a>), GDPR, and other regulations. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://integralads.com/privacy-policy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IAS’s privacy policy</a> has the information they collect and their data retention policies.</p>

<p>This was very helpful for us to know and we are satisfied that there is not anything nefarious going on here. We're therefore going to continue to allow our advertisers to use IAS and other third-party ad fraud services.</p>

<p>Please note that as technologies evolve, we’ll continue to work closely with our clients and third-party vendors to make sure they are following the industry standards and respecting our policies.</p>

"339999","Are excessively long display names for political messaging allowed on SE sites?","<p>I've seen a number of users who have appended ""Reinstate Monica"" or ""Supports Monica"" to their display names, resulting in a very long name. Back when I started on Stack Overflow (around 9 years ago, I think), using the platform for this kind of messaging seemed to be highly frowned upon. Has that changed? If so, can I put ""Abolish ICE!"" or ""Punch Nazis!"" in my display name? Or are only certain political opinions acceptable there?</p>

<p>To clarify: When I originally posted this question, I mentioned that the long name is awkward to @ to reply to, and that including it in replies might be disagreeable to the person replying. These are indeed part of the motivation for the question, and indeed still an aspect, but some mitigations have been offered in comments. The main point, however, is about use of the display name field for off-topic messaging in front of every one who sees the user's questions/answers/comments, whether there's policy on this (vs just de facto tolerance), and whether the policy (or tolerance) will be applied equally.</p>

  they're happy with the experience, they'll renew and buy a year's
  subscription. This will ensure quality questions, or at the very least
  new contributors will have read the help center before paying the fee.
  Users with 20K should be exempt, the site is free for them, as they

"290662","We're Implementing an ""announcement"" Tag for Direct Communication From the Team","<p><em><strong>Update (Feb 17)</strong></em></p>
<p>We're going to scrap this idea as presented. This is something that had been kicked around a bit for the last few months as we considered ways to communicate &quot;This is what we've been doing and thinking about&quot; types of things here on meta.</p>
<p>We're going to develop the idea a bit more and then propose something more thought out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Following up on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/290419/has-our-policy-towards-political-discussions-on-se-sites-changed/290521#290521"">this answer that I wrote</a> to a question wondering if the policy on political discussions had changed (and several other places), I indicated that setting 'announcement-y' type stuff apart from features, bugs and discussions was something we could do to lessen the dissonance folks feel when they find something from us that just .. doesn't look like everything else.</p>
<p>It's just super weird and confusing for us to present stuff to you that isn't really, well, a <em>question</em>  alongside tools for you to close things that aren't  really questions, and expect you not to close stuff that  doesn't really fit.</p>
<p>This post itself is a great example of communication from us that's more dissertative or expository than socratic or mutually-engaging. While we very much welcome and encourage any feedback to this you'd like to provide to this, it isn't really a <em>question</em>, and it was posted mostly to inform folks of something that we're doing. It's a little different from everything else and that's confusing; it tends to bother folks that really care about things being in their proper place.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of communication that we as a company produce: things that are meant for the general public who typically aren't very familiar with the ins-and-outs of what we do (our blog), and things that are meant for the most engaged users on our platform (meta). While these things do often intersect, the Community Growth team is most focused on communication that needs to start <em>here</em>, which might ultimately make its way to the blog in some form.</p>
<p>As our team ramps up our efforts to engage more on our meta sites, we need a way to make certain kinds of communication feel less out of place. In order for that to happen, our software needs to better support it. To do that, we're implementing a new 'root' tag called <a href=""/questions/tagged/announcement"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;announcement&#39;"" rel=""tag"">announcement</a>.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The <a href=""/questions/tagged/announcement"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;announcement&#39;"" rel=""tag"">announcement</a> tag is moderator-only, similar to the <a href=""/questions/tagged/featured"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;featured&#39;"" rel=""tag"">featured</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-completed"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-completed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-completed</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-declined"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-declined</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-deferred"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-deferred&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-deferred</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-norepro"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-norepro&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-norepro</a> tags.</p>
<p>Only those with moderator privileges (regardless of employee status) can apply or remove the tag.</p>
<p>Questions posted with the tag will show a special message underneath:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an announcement from the Stack Overflow team; thanks for reading! We'd love to hear from you if you wish to leave a comment or an answer; you're also welcome to <a href=""/contact"">contact us directly</a> to share any thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, questions with this tag can't be closed, deleted or flagged as spam or abuse. However, this restriction only removes the close and spam / abuse flag options, and only applies to the question itself. All other functionality remains the same.</p>
<h3>Why can't the community vote to close these types of questions?</h3>
<p>Because closing them means that we preclude any additional answers from folks that have something that they'd like to tell us, which is something that simply can't happen.</p>
<h3>Why can't the community flag these types of questions as spam or abusive?</h3>
<p>Because they will have always been written by an employee which means that we're very certain that the posts are neither spam or abusive. We do not wish to risk communication being deleted and the employee posting it dealt a -100 rep penalty.</p>
<p>If you feel that something we've written <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/342539/does-time-to-take-a-stand-adhere-to-the-be-nice-policy"">doesn't fully align with our be-nice policy</a>, there are many less destructive means to let us know.</p>
<h3>Where will this be implemented?</h3>
<p>This will be available on all child meta sites and here on Meta Stack Exchange. We expect to see it used <em>mainly</em> on Meta Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange, along with some use on announcements during private beta periods for very new sites.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we get involved with a contest or event that's very specific to a particular community such as Gaming or others; we'd use this feature to announce the particulars on meta, and the blog to let people know it's happening in a more general way.</p>
<h3>How often will it be used? What kinds of things can we expect to see?</h3>
<p>From one to several times each month, approximately. As Jobs and Documentation continue to evolve at a rapid pace, Meta Stack Overflow might see several more each month. We'll keep the noise down and avoid redundant communication by editing in updates rather than posting something entirely new whenever possible.</p>
<p>If you love updates and have been wanting a way to easily get updates from the team, you can subscribe to and or favorite the tag. If you don't care to see things unless they're major, you can hide the tag and just watch for featured posts.</p>
<h3>Will employees always use this tag when posting?</h3>
<p>No. In fact most of the time <a href=""/questions/tagged/discussion"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;discussion&#39;"" rel=""tag"">discussion</a> is what we're going to be using. This tag is for instances where we'd love feedback if folks had any, but don't really have any particular questions to ask or specific kinds of input that we need to build stuff.</p>
<h3>Would real-world calls to action such as the SOPA or immigration thing use this?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/342903/well-always-endeavor-to-do-whats-right-well-try-to-do-it-better-next-time"">We talked about this on Meta Stack Overflow</a>. From that discussion, two things emerged that I think can help us move past that.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We aren't saying that we'll never need to come engage with you here, or on MSO, if something really serious is going on and we need to not just post something but also have a conversation with you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In all cases going forward that we can <em>currently</em> envision, we'd probably use the blog, and if things get too crazy on the blog or too difficult to moderate (e.g. a lot of noise from people that aren't even users), create an announcement to open a discussion on meta instead.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, ideas you'd like to share or just a general opinion either good or bad about this feature, please let us know in comments or answers.</p>

"343919","Some improvements to blockquotes","<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Sorry for the delay! I’ve been thinking about this feedback in between my other projects, and I’ve landed where I’ve started 😕</p>

<p>I’ve made sure to continue highlighting spoilers in gray. The differentiation from normal blockquotes is super important since their behavior is so different. I explored keeping spoilers yellow, but that still has the same theming issues throughout the network. Red seemed too powerful, with its error connotations.</p>

<p>I understand completely that folks are using blockquotes to highlight images. <em>However</em>, I don’t think that’s a <a href=""https://medium.com/design-is-a-good-idea/mistakes-and-cows-on-the-path-49402445f025"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cowpath</a> we want to formally pave. I’m ok with being opinionated here—blockquotes should be used for quoting, not as a way to highlight images. I understand that this will be frustrating to Machavity who made excellent points about differentiation in his answer, but I don’t think image highlighting ought to dictate how blockquotes are styled.</p>

<p>I’m also cautious of adding borders to images as explored by user1306322 for the same reasons and for the additional fear of being too prescriptive in how we display images there.</p>

<p>It’s a tough one! I went back and forth with the design team and I still think this is the best path forward.</p>

<h3>Original post</h3>

<p>We’re making a few changes to <code>blockquotes</code> soon. Historically, we had a bit of feedback that the yellow backgrounds were overpowering, reducing the contrast of the quote itself. The yellow border also lacks contrast with the background. Others have indicated that there should be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/337979/quotes-should-look-different-from-spoilers"">more visible differences between block quotes and spoilers</a> and between <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/170061/blockquote-and-codeblock-look-too-similar"">code and quotes</a>.</p>

<p>These yellows also compete with theming in our communities, especially those with backgrounds that aren’t perfectly white like English Language &amp; Usage and Role-Playing Games. </p>

<p>We’re proposing we switch to a single gray bar in our blockquotes. This should fix those theming issues and make it easier to distinguish between quotes, spoilers and code.</p>

<p>This will also improve blockquote nesting, since our current nesting is a mess because the darker yellow bar is barely noticeable on the paler yellow background.</p>

<p>Spoilers should pretty much behave exactly the same way. More room for later improvements there.</p>

<p>Here’s how our current blockquotes look. You can click to expand:</p>

"346137","Technical site integration observational experiment live on Stack Overflow","<p><strong>Final Update (2020-4-22):</strong> This experiment has concluded and is now turned off. Thanks for your feedback.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have just made an observational experiment live on Stack Overflow that will test out three ways of integrating links or content from other Technical Stack Exchange sites. (Even though the experiment is only going up on Stack Overflow, we are posting about it here since it also relates to Technical Stack Exchange sites. We have made <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/396370/technical-site-integration-observational-experiment-live-on-stack-overflow"">a related post on MSO</a> as well.) This experiment will be live for two weeks, through April 22, and will then be turned off.</p>

<p>This experiment will show three different variants to a small number of users (anonymous and logged in). The first two variants will add three links to Technical Stack Exchange sites to the left sidebar on every page, either above the Teams section or below it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/gYoB7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gYoB7.png"" alt=""A and B sidebar variants""></a></p>

<p>The third variant will show a new section on the homepage labeled as Technical Communities Recently Active Questions that will contain links to two or three questions from other Technical Stack Exchange sites that are pulled from the Hot Network Questions list. If you are part of a Team, then you already see a similar section with recent questions from your team.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/568t2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/568t2.png"" alt=""Variant C - Homepage content module""></a></p>

<p>This observational experiment is part of a larger discovery process that we are in the middle of that is exploring potential ways of allowing more integrations between Stack Overflow and other related sites on the Stack Exchange network. These specific variants were chosen because they allow us to (relatively) easily test out different basic ways of integrating links or content to other Technical Stack Exchange sites. The goal is to see how users react to seeing these new paths of content integration, and to use this as one factor in deciding if (and whether) to proceed with other efforts in this area.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>What are the goals of this initiative? Why is it good for users?</strong></p>

<p>While we do not know the final form that this initiative will take, the general goal is to find new ways of integrating content between Stack Overflow and other Technical sites, and to give users more options in this area. We have found that the average SO user is either not aware of other Technical sites on the network (which often include content that is relevant to them) or would support a closer integration between SO and technical content from other sites. Increased awareness can also help leading to fewer off topic questions on SO (where “this is an SF/SU question” is a common off topic reason)  As plans begin to take more shape over the next few months, we plan to keep the Community up to date as well.</p>

<p><strong>How are you choosing which Technical Sites to show or to draw content from?</strong></p>

<p>If a user has pinned Technical Sites in their site switcher, we will use the first three from there. After that we will prioritize Technical Sites where the user has an existing account. Most users (who do not have sites defined in the site switcher or accounts on other sites) will see links to or content from three of the most popular technical sites.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you telling us about this? Won’t this skew the results?</strong></p>

<p>Since this is something that is going to be publicly visible, it is inevitable that users will be asking questions about this, so we wanted to preempt any confusion and share what we know up front. That said, overall the reach of this experiment (around 10% of homepage visitors seeing the content module there, and around 1.5% of users seeing the left sidebar variants) should go far beyond the users who will be reading this post, so we don’t anticipate foreknowledge having a significant impact on our results.</p>

<p><strong>How can I see the variants if I'm not selected or if I want to see the other versions?</strong></p>

<p>We've included the screenshots of the three variants here for you to see but, you can't have it turned on (or off) or change groups. The experiment will only be shown to a small percentage of users for a limited time. <em>Update 1</em>: functionality has been added that will allow users in variant C (the home page content module) to be able to collapse the module. When collapsed, this state will be observed on subsequent page loads in the same browser for one week. <em>Update 2</em>: An additional button has been added that will appear in the Collapsed state for Variant C which will allow you to <code>[hide]</code> the section completely for the duration of the experiment (in the same browser).</p>

"350184","Feedback post: New moderator reinstatement and appeal process revisions","<p>We have not made any significant changes to the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336175/what-is-the-process-for-reinstating-a-moderator"">current moderator reinstatement policy</a> since it was released. Though it has functioned well for the cases to which it was applied, we acknowledge that the Community has some concerns that need to be addressed (especially given events of the end of 2019).</p>
<p>In our original version of this policy we omitted some elements from the public view, such as the opportunities for communication between the applicant and CM1. The changes to the policy include both fixing that by including more details of the policy in the post and also addressing other existing concerns that the policy did not adequately cover.</p>
<p>It is with this in mind that we present the linked policy for an <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/336176"">updated moderator reinstatement and appeal process</a>.</p>
<p>We recognize that the main concern brought up by the community with regards to the previous version was a lack of trust that the process would be carried out fairly in all cases. And while trust is something that can be freely given, in cases where it is lost it must be actively earned anew. The intention of this improved process is to provide a framework through which this can take place, in a way that is as open and transparent to all parties as possible. To add to that, the old version of the process left the responsibility for denying reinstatements solely in the hands of the CM team, which with a lack of formalized openness (even if in practice the communication and openness is consistently happening outside of the formal process) further contributed to community distrust.</p>
<p>With these in mind, some of the main changes aimed at addressing those concerns and focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing for more Community involvement (through the Mod Council) in moderator reinstatements in cases where there is a recommendation for denial.</li>
<li>Formalizing the ways in which the previous mod requesting reinstatement can see the claims against them and be able to respond to them (at multiple points during the process).</li>
<li>Adding more transparency to what had been a black-box process from the perspective of the community.</li>
<li>Involving staff from a wider range of backgrounds and perspectives to be part of this decision making process, when necessary.</li>
<li>Allowing the reinstatement process to also serve as an appeals process for mods who feel that they were dealt with unfairly during their removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of scenarios for reinstatements are being included at the bottom of this post, to demonstrate in practical terms how the process could unfold.</p>
<p>The new process was co-authored by myself (Yaakov), JNat and Catija from the Community Management team, and Teresa Dietrich. It was further reviewed by all members of the Community Leadership Team, by representatives of the Community Members at Large group and the Mod Council, as well as being available to all other moderators for review.</p>
<p>We expect that some of you may have questions about the revised process and want some clarifications. <strong>This post is a place for you to ask them</strong>. We very much respect the value of meta discussion but would like to keep the process posts clean. Having the discussion here makes that easier. We have cross-linked the posts so that they're easy to find.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Example Reinstatement Scenarios</h3>
<p>The new process is quite lengthy in order to account for the different ways that the process can go, and to allow for as much transparency and openness as possible in each of these steps. Because of the variables in every case, it is impossible to be able to predict how things will go in most scenarios that are even a little bit complicated. That said, we would like to present two example scenarios for reinstatements and how they might play out in the actual process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scenario 1 (Routine Reinstatement)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PM (Previous Moderator) reaches out to the CM team to apply for reinstatement, explaining the circumstances surrounding their removal: they stepped down due to a change in personal circumstances that left them without enough time to perform their mod duties. After the PM’s circumstances changed again and they had more time, they requested to be reinstated.</li>
<li>CMs are assigned and investigate the circumstances of the removal. Upon seeing that the removal was requested by the mod with no other extenuating circumstances, CM1 reaches out to the current Mod team on the site for which PM is requesting reinstatement to see if they have any objections.</li>
<li>None of the current mods have objections, the reinstatement is approved, and the PM has their moderator status restored. Total time: around one week from the initial request for reinstatement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scenario 2 (violation of moderator agreement)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PM is appealing an involuntary removal and requesting reinstatement, and contests the claims of any wrongdoing in the cases that led to removal.</li>
<li>(CM and Mod Team Evaluation): CMs are assigned and investigate the circumstances of the removal: CM1 finds that the PM was removed after being warned several times regarding potential violations of the Mod Agreement (specifically: questionable access of user PII). After seeing this, CM1 relates these details to the PM and asks the PM if they have anything to add or clarify, or if any details are missing. The PM admits accessing the user's PII, but claims to have not done anything with the information or saved it in any way, and provides evidence to substantiate that the data was not misused (evidence had not been given during the removal process). CM1 checks with the Current Mod team, who do not express objections to the reinstatement. CM1 and CM2 agree to the reinstatement (since the PM was able to satisfy them that they had not shared the PII), with the precondition that PM should participate in an online Privacy and Personal Security training module. The PM maintains that they should not have the precondition as they had not shared the PII, and appeals to the Community Leadership Team (CLT). (Time elapsed since initial request: 2 weeks.)</li>
<li>(Escalation 1): The CLT goes over all relevant records and affirms this recommendation. The current Mod team maintains their original position. The PM rejects these options and asks for a review by the Mod Council. (Time elapsed since initial request: 3 weeks.)</li>
<li>(Escalation 2): The Mod Council selects five members to participate in this evaluation and is provided with all materials gathered thus far. They ask (through CM1) some follow-up questions to the PM regarding the circumstances that surrounded the access of PII. Following their deliberation, they agree with the recommendation of the CM team and the CLT (and submit a request for the training module to be made optionally available to all moderators). The CLT reviews all recommendations and affirms the decision from Escalation 1. The PM decides to accept the precondition, and after they have gone through the Privacy training module and reaffirmed their mod agreement, they are reinstated. (Time elapsed since initial request: 5 weeks.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Changes in this version</h3>
<ul>
<li>2020-07-13:
<ul>
<li>Renamed main sections to start with A, B, C to make them easier to reference</li>
<li>Added A.1.2.5: made it clear that we will share with the PM the names of the CMs involved, and that they may include questions regarding CM selection on subsequent escalations.</li>
<li>In A.5.1: specified that in case of a reinstatement being approved and an appeal pending, the reinstatement may proceed before a decision is made regarding the appeal, if all other requirements for the reinstatement are met.</li>
<li>In A.5.2.2: made it clear that the PM may appeal preconditions.</li>
<li>In B.1b.3: clarified that the PM must approve of any details shared with the mod council in the case of a veto.</li>

"354978","Responding to the Lavender Letter and commitments moving forward","<p>I want to start by acknowledging the hurt and exhaustion that the members of the LGBTQIA+ community and their allies have experienced in our community as moderators and users.  We have read the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/334577/51"">Lavender Letter</a> internally and repeatedly discussed how we can support you in the future. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to speak with some of the authors of this letter in a call and in chat, for which I am grateful. They were gracious enough to share specific experiences and struggles to help me understand the letter and how we can better support their needs.</p>
<p>We want to apologize to the LGBTQIA+ community members for the hurt they endured from our inactions or actions in the past. There are numerous members of the LGBTQIA+ community and a network of allies (among which I count myself) at every level of the company, and we all want to better support you going forward. I am sorry that this letter took so long to respond to publicly. We have been working behind the scenes to understand the needs of the LGBTQIA+ community and to be able to get to a place where we can schedule and commit to timeframes for these responses. We have had a lot to work through internally to better support our entire community, but this topic is important to us.</p>
<p>In the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"">Code of Conduct</a>, we state “We don’t tolerate any language likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — and those are just a few examples.”  To clarify, this includes discussion questioning or debating the legitimacy of someone’s race, gender, sexual orientation or religion.  Further, the debate or discussion of whether or not you want to or should use a person’s pronouns is both offensive and alienating.</p>
<p>Based on the letter and subsequent conversations, we are making these commitments to address the concerns raised:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All members of the Community Team and selected members of the Public Platform Team have already taken 13 hours of Diversity &amp; Inclusion Training.  This training has been coordinated and advised by our own internal diversity &amp; inclusion expert.  We’ve also been provided with resources for best practices in using pronouns and to help us better identify microaggressions specifically towards our LGBTQIA+ users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teachers’ Lounge moderation tools are on the roadmap for the Public Platform team for Q4 of this year. This will allow the room to be moderated like other chat rooms.
The second module of Moderator Training will focus on Diversity &amp; Inclusion, and will be launched by the end of the year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clarifications on the Code of Conduct and our commitment to enforcing it:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We’ve established a new procedure for handling CoC violation reports: If the CM looking at it deems that it’s completely not actionable (meaning it can, without a doubt, be dismissed outright), they must ask a second CM to confirm. If the second believes it should trigger an investigation, one has to happen. In a case where the complaint is against a moderator, this will trigger the Moderator Conduct Review Process - any CM can opt out of the investigation if they feel biased and the remaining CMs are randomly assigned.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where appropriate, we commit to reviewing and revising the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336177/feedback-post-moderator-review-and-reinstatement-processes/336240"">Moderator Conduct Review Process</a> to ensure fairness and openness, while addressing much of the feedback we have received about the existing process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/legal/privacy-policy"">Privacy Policy</a> prevents us from sharing whether or not action was taken against third parties due to a report. However, we still want to provide the reporter with closure, and are working on automation to let you know when the report is closed. You should receive an acknowledgement once we start work on it, and at the end of the month we’ll send a batch response to reports that were dealt with during that month - letting the reporter know the matter is now closed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have heard complaints about alleged Code of Conduct violations from 2019 and earlier where the public perception is that a thorough investigation was not carried out, or that the user may not have received a sufficient warning (or other consequence). As we said above, we are unable to comment on the specifics of any case. And while we understand and empathize with the pain involved in these issues, we are not going to reopen old cases at this time. We are optimistic that these types of events will not recur. That said, an investigation into a new Code of Conduct violation will also include an evaluation of any previous issues whether or not the user was officially warned, and these can influence the result of the investigation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe these commitments will better enable our staff to support LGBTQIA+ community members, help our 550+ moderators learn more about how these issues impact their sites and guide them in how to handle effectively situations that may occur. We are taking a strong stance to protect the LGBTQIA+ members of our community and ensure they can participate safely in the network. I hope that the Lavender Letter’s authors will continue to share and collaborate with us in the future to identify more opportunities for improvement.  We commit to listening to your concerns and responding appropriately to improve the community experience for LGBTQIA+ members going forward.</p>

"309746","A new (2018) update to our Terms of Service is here","<p>But not just because it's 2018, although that's a fine reason to do a great number of things.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/364145/coming-soon-stack-overflow-for-teams"">Stack Overflow For Teams</a> is launching soon, and we need to include stuff that talks about us expecting people to pay for it, and,</li>

<li>The new terms include an arbitration clause. </li>
</ol>

<p>Arbitration is pretty standard for free online products, but if you really don’t like it, we included a way you can opt out.</p>

<p>Essentially, just procedural stuff, even if some of it sounds lawyer-y. But, legal stuff tends to sound, well ... lawyer-y.</p>

<p>You’ll get one of those annoying emails about it in the days ahead, but we wanted to give you a heads-up about it here now. We didn’t set out to change anything we didn’t have to on the user-facing side, but we did have to adjust some things to be consistent due to the changes for Teams, GDPR, and to bring it all up to date. </p>

<p>As always, you should theoretically read every word, but we wanted to call out the only things that we can find that are different for individual users on the public (non-Teams) Q&amp;A sites.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>See updated schedule below and updated stock theme</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As promised (albeit delayed), we are posting site themes for our first group of network sites for comment. The goal here is to allow the community in general and users of these sites specifically to see how the new theming will be applied to these sites. </p>

<p>Again, we acknowledge that this is a painful change for sites that have rich, custom themes. I want to reinforce that the theme changes are a required step to deliver ongoing value to the sites with as little friction as possible. We released changes for <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/312180/354333"">tag watching</a> (aka favorite tags) this week and will be releasing a beta of custom question list functionality soon. The only way to make sure Q&amp;A improvements are quickly available to all Q&amp;A sites is to fix our themes. </p>

<p>To recap from the original post on themes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every Q&amp;A site has its own theme. But there is great inequality in the level of theming that we support. A few (~10) get <a href=""https://photo.stackexchange.com/"">Cadillac treatment</a>, some (&lt;50) are more like a <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/"">Honda</a>, while most (~100) are a <a href=""https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/"">Yugo</a>. The reality is we created a theming system that we didn't have the design resources to fully support, thus the inequity. In addition, as currently defined, our theming gets in the way of releasing new features on the sites. </p>
  
  <p>In order to deliver the left nav, responsive design and future improvements to all sites we've created a more standardized way to support theming. This will reduce the burden of supporting designs as we make Q&amp;A improvements. The result is that most sites will see an improvement in the level of theming that they can get. While some sites will see a reduction. All of Q&amp;A (Enterprise, Teams, etc) will standardize on this new theming scheme.</p>

"329763","We're testing advertisements across the network","<p>For several years we've had advertising solely on technology-related sites. But many of our sites aren't about technology at all, so we haven't sold ads for them. Traditionally, that hasn't been a hardship since Stack Exchange sites have required only a small investment from the company to set up and keep live.</p>

<p>However, as we've continued to grow, the resources needed to maintain our network have also increased. Thanks entirely to the efforts of the network's communities, we have become an amazing resource on the Internet.  Generating revenue from non-technology sites will enable us to dedicate more resources to meeting your needs so this is good news!   </p>

<p>The test has been in effect since May 21, 2019, and our advertising team will be monitoring to see how ads are performing. We don't know how many ads will run on each site, we're testing different solutions. It could be just a few or a bit more. In either case, these ads will be carefully vetted and we'll be keeping watch to continue to provide good content.</p>

<p>If you see any ads that are inappropriate or have any questions about this experiment, please let me know by starting a new question and tagging it with <a href=""/questions/tagged/advertising"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;advertising&#39;"" rel=""tag"">advertising</a>. This is a work in progress and we are expecting a time of learning and refinement as we move forward.</p>

<p>A few things to be aware of: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>We've received reports about ads that redirect, and those have been removed.  We've also received reports about ads that are spammy and those too have been removed.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you wish to report an advertisement, please take a screenshot of the ad and paste the URL (if possible) along with the site where you saw it to a comment or answer.  I'll report it to the ads team and we can track it down to investigate.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the network sites will show more ads than others. This is not due to reduced ad privileges (which don't exist right now for the network) but rather to inventory allowances. </p></li>
<li><p>This is an experiment that will take us to about the end of the year.  As such, we're learning about what advertiser networks will work for us and which can offer the quality of ads that we desire. I ask for your patience and understanding during this testing period.  </p></li>
<li><p>Due to an already existing agreement, MathOverflow will not be getting ads and is not a part of this experiment. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your help in reporting what you see and for forgiving us of the mess as we do some remodeling!</p>

The purpose of <em>this</em> post is to address the concern expressed most frequently in response to the initial proposal: no attribution requirement. Also, we want to make sure everyone has ample opportunity to provide feedback and we have time to consider it. We are more concerned with doing this right than doing it fast, so please let us know what you think about this proposed change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month ago <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-stack-exchange"">we proposed new licensing terms</a> to cover code posted at Stack Overflow and across the Stack Exchange network. Hundreds of you voted on the proposal, and many of you let us know how we could improve. We gathered all your feedback, and after careful consideration we have amended the proposal.</p>
<p>2 changes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attribution now continues to be required</strong> when you use code found at Stack
Overflow and Stack Exchange</li>
<li><s>The changes will now go into effect <strong>March 1, 2016</strong></s> The changes proposed here have been delayed indefinitely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Change 1 was made to accommodate contributors who want credit, plus to help developers identify the provenance of a Stack Overflow code snippet when they find it integrated into a project. Change 2 was made to allow you more time to digest this change and socialize it within your organizations.</p>
<p>Both changes were thoroughly vetted internally, with our lawyers, and with the OSI. We think they are an improvement upon the previous proposal, and a vast improvement upon the status quo.</p>
<p>As always, community input has been instrumental in moving this initative forward. We're fairly certain we've arrived at the best possible balance for everyone's needs, but if you spot anything new you think we've missed, please let us know.</p>
<p><strong>The Fine Print:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the change goes live, new contributions across the network will be
licensed to the public under the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-code contributions will continue to be available for use under the terms of CC-BY-SA</li>
<li>Code contributions will be available for use under the terms of <a href=""https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the MIT License</a></li>
<li>You don’t have to include the full MIT License in your code base. Contributors agree to give code users permission to ignore the MIT
License’s notice preservation requirement, as long as users give
reasonable attribution. This optional exception to the MIT License
will live in our terms of service.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The only difference between the terms described above and the previous proposal is the removal of the requirement to add attribution <em>only</em> “upon request of the copyright holder (or Stack Exchange on behalf of the copyright holder)”. “Reasonable attribution” is now required by end users of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange.</p>
<p><strong>What is reasonable attribution?</strong></p>
<p>A URL as a comment in your code is reasonable attribution.</p>
<p>There are certainly other forms of reasonable attribution, depending on use, and you are welcome to go above and beyond what’s required and include username, date, and anything else if you like.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to use the MIT License as it is traditionally interpreted: by preserving the full license with relevant fields (copyright year and copyright holder) completed.</p>
<p>Full guidance will be provided in an upcoming FAQ.</p>
<p><strong>When will the new terms go into effect?</strong></p>
<p><s>March 1, 2016</s> The changes proposed here have been delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>What about other sites on the Stack Exchange network?</strong></p>
<p>The new terms will go into effect for all new code on all sites in the Stack Exchange network.</p>
<p>We understand that some users feel the new terms are not a perfect fit for certain sites, but we think fragmenting the license across the network will lead to ambiguity – the exact problem we’re trying to solve by updating the terms.</p>
<p><strong>What about code contributed prior to this change?</strong></p>
<p>This change is just a first step in establishing clarity for using code found on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Code contributed prior to this change will be governed by the CC BY-SA license as it has always been. We are exploring ways we might distinguish code covered by each license regime, and we hope to soon roll out an opt-in mechanism to let users relicense their old contributions under the new terms.</p>
<p><strong>But what is code?</strong></p>
<p>We will give you guidance on identifying code in an upcoming FAQ, plus guidance on how best to comply with the attribution requirement. But ultimately, identifying code will be a judgement call on your part. We have full faith in your ability to do this.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
<p>We want to hear what you think. Barring any showstopper, <s>these terms and a detailed FAQ will be rolled out March 1, 2016</s>.</p>

"316934","Revisiting the ""Hot Network Questions"" feature, what are our shared goals for having it?","<h2>Thanks for your input here and elsewhere on Meta.</h2>
<p>Please see the results of this discussion on the update post:<br />
<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/325060/updating-the-hot-network-questions-list-now-with-a-bit-more-network-and-a-litt"">Updating the Hot Network Questions List - now with a bit more network and a little less &quot;hotness&quot;!</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Some things happened yesterday that caused a need for us to (quickly) remove a site's eligibility to contribute to the <a href=""https://stackexchange.com"">list of hot network questions</a>. For those of you not familiar with what we've come to call the 'HNQ' list, please visit the link; the list of questions shown as 'hot' on stackexchange.com are displayed in the sidebar of <em>most</em> Stack Exchange sites. Here's an idea of what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/7xvlD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7xvlD.png"" alt=""Screen shot of hot network questions in the sidebar"" /></a></p>
<p>It's a list of titles, with their origins vaguely identifiable by the presence of the 'favicon' element that identifies each site. We're <em>extremely</em> proud of the quality of content that can be found on every single site in our network. The <em>titles</em>, however, when shown out of context, can be problematic. Anything out of context can be problematic.</p>
<p>This isn't a new problem. We've dealt with trigger words in titles that occur naturally <em>through good-faith questions</em> on sites like Parenting, Gaming, Christianity, Islam and more. While we probably deserve some egg on our face for relying on regular expressions as a go-to quick fix, <em>they've been sufficient</em> for ensuring trigger words and <em>overt</em> clickbait was kept out of the list for the most part.</p>
<p>Then we launched a site that tended to have 3-4 hot questions asked each <em>day</em> (by any way one could conceivably measure velocity and good reception). The titles of these questions, out of context, are just <em>too</em> likely to be inappropriate on our professional and academic sites, so we took the site out of the contributing list. Still with me? Thank you, because there's no way to open this discussion without background.</p>
<p>This is one <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hot-questions"">of many times</a> we've talked about problems with hot network questions. This isn't a new problem. What escalated the problem is that we had to take an entire <em>site</em> out of the mix, which isn't ideal, and I'll explain why.</p>
<h3>What goals do we have for the hot question list?</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>They help with discovery. User interviews continue to reveal that folks simply <em>don't</em> often discover just how big of a resource we've become collectively. The list boosts engagement in quite a few ways (we'll admit some of them aren't optimal)</p>
</li>
<li><p>They often remind communities to have discussions about scope. If folks see a clear demand for certain kinds of questions, it's worth revisiting conversations about how valuable finding ways to meet those needs might be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hot questions are <em>extremely</em> great fodder for evangelists, the kinds of people that reach thousands of folks that are likely to identify with the way we do Q&amp;A.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let's face it, they're a jackpot and a curse. A little patch of chaos that grows pumpkins and poison ivy - just usually more pumpkins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>What's broken?</h3>
<p>The list of questions is generated through a <em>very</em> expensive query, cached, and refreshed on a set schedule. Giving moderators or even community managers the ability to 'evict' a problematic title while keeping the system in check with what we consider performant and sane are .. mutually-exclusive goals.</p>
<p>Now that we have gotten to the point where we've gone from saying &quot;Let's ignore titles with these words..&quot; to &quot;Let's ignore sites with these titles..&quot;, we're seeing a pattern of scale that starts to suck if you think about it protractedly.</p>
<h3>What do we need from you?</h3>
<p>We want some ideas on ways we can continue to meet our goals of getting the right sites in front of the right people who are likely to appreciate them and participate.</p>
<p>Automatic selection simply <em>will not scale</em> if we continue to push the limits of subjective topic spaces, and we need to continue to do that for the network to grow and remain relevant to the issues folks want to use our software creatively to solve.</p>
<h3>We don't expect to solve this problem in one post right away.</h3>
<p>Let's say we agree to take out the hot network questions entirely. <em>But</em>, we want something else in its place that continues to pull in some of the benefits, without being such a mindless pain in the neck.</p>
<p>In order to find out what that could look like, we need to consolidate what <em>we</em> want out of it. And that could be &quot;Just turn the darn thing off and be done with it&quot;, or &quot;I found my favorite site through that list, you gotta preserve that somehow!&quot; -- all of this input at this stage will be equally good.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, the HNQ (as we know it) is now looking at numbered days, but that number is probably kind of high because it's going to take some work to figure out what voids would be worth filling if we yanked it as we know it now.</p>
<p>So, let's talk about it. And, if this seems like it's a continuation of a conversation, it is, from the moderator chat room. Even though the scope of the discussion is still rough, I wanted to get it out 'in sunlight' early, this isn't something to be settled in an all-mod room.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, we look forward to finally (at least committing) to settle on something we can all like a bit more than what we've currently got.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of causing tons of people to flood into a single discussion, I'm going to feature this; I just can't help it.</p>

<p>We acknowledge our responses to her requests for clarification were not satisfactory. The verbiage in our Code of Conduct could have been more explicitly detailed about what was expected. We always valued Ms. Cellio’s contributions to the community and respect her intelligence, integrity, and professional writing skills. </p>

<p>While our initial statement did not address her specifically, we regret that we used her name when responding to a reporter's follow-up. We regret any damage to Ms. Cellio's reputation and any other damage she may have suffered. </p>

<p>We have since updated some of our policies and processes to help ensure we are more careful in our public communications, and that there is a clearer process anytime a moderator's status is revoked as well as a process for reinstatement.</p>

<p>We respect Ms. Cellio and believe she is a good person with much to offer and contribute. We sincerely hope she remains an active member of our community. In recognition of the mistakes that led us here, we invited Ms. Cellio to apply for possible reinstatement on all six sites following our new reinstatement process. Ms. Cellio expressed concerns about the new process and has not applied.</p>

We tried to anticipate likely questions, but… missed the mark a bit.

<p>We know some of you may still have questions or additional clarification on some points. We're happy to further improve the wording of either questions or answers or add answers to new questions. This post here is the place to talk through that. For ease of voting and responding, <strong>please limit each answer to one specific concern</strong>.</p>

<p>However, note that debating the core of the new rule (""please use stated pronouns"") or the validity of people's identities or gender expressions is off-topic for this post, and we won't be entertaining those debates at this point and posts that aren't questions or requests for clarification may be deleted.</p>

<p>Please also note that the FAQ is very long as it is but the questions in it represent a broad spectrum of questions we've seen repeatedly over the last weeks. It doesn't cover many edge cases as an FAQ is not meant to cover/address every edge case that may come up - trying to preemptively legislate for <em>everything</em> hypothetically is a bad practice. Some of the bridges we will have to cross when we get to them, and the Community Management team will work with Moderators to deal with those as they come.</p>

"334551","An apology to our community, and next steps","<p><em>I’m David Fullerton, Stack Overflow’s CTO, responsible for the product, engineering, and community teams.</em></p>

<p>I joined Stack Overflow in 2010 because I believed in the vision and mission of Stack Overflow. I wanted to be a part of building a community where programmers come together to help one another learn and share their knowledge with one another. I loved how the site was run in the open, in collaboration with its community, and moderated by members of the community.</p>

<p>I’m here nearly a decade later because I believe we can continue to build this community together and make it an even more welcoming and inclusive place than it is today.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, we made a series of mistakes, both in our actions and in the ways that we communicated those actions. In doing so, we hurt people who believe in that mission and who want to help us make the community welcoming and open to all. While Sara and others were on the front lines of that, I was personally involved at each step along the way and ultimately responsible, and I’m deeply sorry for the hurt that we’ve caused.</p>

<p>First of all, we hurt members of our LGBTQ+ community when they felt they couldn’t participate authentically and we didn’t respond quickly or strongly enough in supporting them. Worse, through our handling of this situation, we made them a target for harassment as people debated their right to express themselves and be addressed according to how they identify.</p>

<p>I am responsible for that, and I am deeply sorry. We absolutely support the LGBTQ+ community, and we’re committed to making our community a place that is open and welcoming to everyone. We’re working on an update to our Code of Conduct which we’re sharing with moderators for feedback tomorrow and the rest of the community later this week. We’ll also work on making more resources and materials available to our moderators to help them support members of the community as we all learn together how to be more welcoming and inclusive.</p>

<p>Second, we hurt a longstanding member of the community and an important volunteer moderator. She deserved the benefit of a private, comprehensive process. In the absence of a clear process for handling this kind of situation, we should have taken inspiration from our existing <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/157258/146719"">Moderator Action Review Process</a>. We made a decision to act quickly, which I personally approved, but in doing so skipped several critical parts of the process. In acting quickly, we also acted at a time which coincided with a Jewish holiday which she and many other members of our community observe, and we should have taken that more into account in the process.</p>

<p>I’m responsible for that, and I’m sorry. We’ll be reaching out to her directly to apologize for the lack of process, privacy, and to discuss next steps. We’ll keep those discussions completely private unless we both agree to share any of it with the community.</p>

<p>We’ll be sharing with our moderators this week our proposed processes for handling situations like this in the future. This includes a process for handling moderator removals, and a process for reinstating moderators who wish to be reinstated. </p>

<p>Third, we hurt the moderators and members of our communities. Community moderation is the backbone of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, and our moderators are a vital part of us creating a more welcoming and inclusive place. We need to be working <em>with</em> our moderators and community, rather than working against them, in order to create the kind of community where everyone feels welcome and able to share their knowledge.</p>

<p>I’m responsible for that as well, and I’m sorry for the hurt that we’ve caused. Going forward, we will be working with the community to overhaul how we gather input and feedback from our moderators and members of the community to make sure that your voices are heard and involved in the process, not just informed after decisions have been made.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to apologize again for all of the pain we have caused. I am more committed than ever to creating a welcoming and inclusive community across Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, and the mistakes we made over the past few weeks made that worse, not better. I know we have lost the trust of many of you, and that trust must be re-earned over time by more than just words. That starts this week with some of the concrete steps we are taking with the moderator removal process and the Code of Conduct changes, but the hard work will continue for years. Those first steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Monday, October 7, we’ll be sharing a second draft of an update to our Code of Conduct with all moderators for feedback</li>
<li>On Thursday, October 10, the update to the Code of Conduct will be announced publicly</li>
<li>By Friday, October 11, we’ll share the processes for moderator removal and reinstatement with moderators for their feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking forward, Stack Overflow is just beginning this new stage in its growth as a company. One of our top priorities across the entire team is to continue to make the community more inclusive and welcoming.  We recognize that the community is the heartbeat of Stack Overflow, and we deeply appreciate all that you do. We know that our moderators care deeply about the future of our community, and we’re committed to involving you more as we evolve. We have an incredible opportunity to impact the world, and we hope that you will continue to join us on that mission.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening, and thank you for your patience with us as we continue to work our way through this.</p>

<p>We expect that some of you may have questions about the processes and want some clarifications. <strong>This post is a place for you to ask them.</strong> Please do not post questions about the process on those posts - they will be removed.</p>
<p>We very much respect the value of meta discussion but would like to keep the process posts clean and not have to delete all of the discussion to make the actual policy clear. Having the discussion here makes that easier. We have cross-linked the posts so that they're easy to find.</p>

"310908","Live: Left nav, new theming and responsiveness","<blockquote>
  <p>This post is now locked due to a lot of off-topic or very tangentially related issues being posted here. It's so large that it is pretty hard to find/triage issues listed. If you have a concern related to left nav, theming and/or responsiveness, then I'd encourage you to post them as a question on MSE or on the meta of the specific site you're concerned with.</p>

<p>We have released left navigation bar, our new theming and a our initial responsive design work on Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange (it's been live on MSO for a week). This work has been in progress and being discussed with the community for several months. The motivation for the work is covered in my post entitled <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes"">Ch-ch-ch-changes: Left nav, responsive design, &amp; themes</a>, so check that out if you have any questions about why this work is important.</p>

<h2>Left nav and theming</h2>

<p>Check out the new left navigation and new theme (most relevant to MSE). This work creates greater experience consistency across the Q&amp;A sites and will increase in the velocity of bug fixes, improvements and new features to all sites thanks to a fully unified code base.</p>

<p>Based on early feedback from our initial announcement we've added a preference to unpin the left nav so it doesn't take up space. Just head on down to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/preferences/current"">your local preferences</a> and check the box. </p>

<p>This is the biggest changes we made based on early feedback from the community. Check out the full list here: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/309349/left-nav-responsive-design-and-theming-next-steps"">Left nav, responsive design, and theming next steps</a>  </p>

<h2>Responsive design</h2>

<p>Many of the most used pages on the site are now responsive to your window size. This benefits people who have lower resolution devices or like to have multiple windows in view. This functionality has been live for a few weeks for Stack Overflow for Teams users. </p>

<p><strong>This is a work in progress</strong> and this step is a part of our effort to validate our significant changes to page layout code. Not all pages are responsive yet, asking a question and many moderator or review activities will not work in a smaller viewport and you'll need to expand the window. We are making improvements to this experience week by week, so it will just keep getting better.</p>

<p>We haven't fully optimized this for mobile devices, but click the ""full site"" option in the footer and you will get the responsive design on your phone. If for some reason you need access to the non-responsive version, we have a temporary feature for turning that on. Just click ""Disable Responsive"" option in the footer. This is a temporary feature that will go away once all the pages/features have been made responsive. The mobile optimized view will also remain in place until we finish making all the changes.</p>

<p>You can read more about the ins and outs in <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/367724/responsive-design-is-enabled-for-teams-users"">Responsive design is enabled for Teams users</a>.</p>

<h2>When is this coming to other sites?</h2>

<p>After we gather feedback via this sneak peek on MSO/MSE we will be releasing this on other sites. Currently the plan is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mid-June: 

<ul>
<li>✅ release to SO and MSE</li>
<li>✅ post update on fonts and theming: 
<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311033/fonts-and-the-new-qa-theming"">Fonts and the new Q&amp;A theming</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>July: release to network sites with ""stock"" theme and 5-10 other sites</li>
<li>August - September: release to the remaining sites. As we have more details we will update individual communities in their local meta.</li>
</ul>
