"273075","Lower the bar for downvoting on Meta.SE","<h3>User Disenfranchisement</h3>

<p>When a user notices a featured Meta.SE topic in their own site's sidebar that impacts them, and they click through to Meta.SE, a significant number of them, regardless of their expertise in their subject and site, cannot show their disagreement with the change by downvoting because they have not already participated in Meta.SE enough to downvote.</p>

<h3>Evidence</h3>

<p>The results of this user disenfranchisement are clear.  You have announcements with an upvote/downvote record of 594/124 while the highest voted response is negative towards the proposal, and has 629/26 votes.</p>

<p>It is then trivial to assume that because the main post's votes are largely positive, there must be significant support for the proposal, when the reality is that there is significant unhappiness about the proposal, but we've disenfranchised users so they are unable to express it appropriately. Further, we cannot simply assume that the 629 negative cancel out the 594 positive and assume half the people don't like the proposal because it's possible to vote positively for the proposal, then after reading the later discussion changing one's mind and being unable to change their vote on the proposal until someone edits it (they certainly can't edit it!).</p>

<h3>Work-arounds</h3>

<p>While there are some work-arounds, such as hosting discussions on individual metas and trying to bring those responses to the table, as well as upvoting the negative responses in the hopes that people they trust pay attention, this is inadequate.  In such cases people <em>still</em> assert that there is more positive support for such a proposal than negative disapproval.</p>

<h3>Meta is <strike>murder</strike> different</h3>

<p>Meta is actually another Stack Exchange site for experts about Stack Exchange, and so it makes sense to have some bars for participation in terms of how new users can contribute and gain reputation.</p>

<p>As you notice, though, there are things discussed here that have <strong><em>significant, direct impact</em></strong> on other sites.</p>

<p>Further, downvotes on Meta are often used to indicate disagreement - in the same way we originally used Uservoice to prioritize features and express agreement and disagrement. To some degree it's a priority queue, but it's terribly unbalanced if the vast majority of our users can only put positive pressure on change proposals.</p>

<h3>Conclusion and recommendation</h3>

<p>Down-voting should not be tied to the high level of reputation currently required -  <strong>you don't need Meta.SE expertise to evaluate the usefulness of an idea to you or your site</strong>. On a regular site you vote according to truthiness, but <strong>here you vote according to usefulness given your perspective/experience.</strong></p>

<h1>Meta.SE should lower the bar for downvoting, making it equivalent to upvoting.</h1>

<p>Because there is still a 2 rep cost associated with downvoting, this will still be self-limiting, and prevent significant abuse.  Once a person downvotes significantly, they will have to also participate in other ways to continue to downvote.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially in programming teams, someone who is very familiar with a piece of software may discover or be directed to a question that they are very qualified to solve. Of course, this could also apply to a game developer finding a question about their game on Arqade or a researcher finding a question about their area of expertise on Computer Science.SE. In some cases, this person may have trouble answering the question because they have insufficient reputation to ask for clarification.</p>

<p>I propose that we provide a mechanism for another user to vouch for this expert's expertise or ability, which would allow that user to post comments on the question. This should require significantly higher reputation than what is required to comment (I think the ""Established user"" privilege, at 1000, would be a good spot). Doing this would also <strong>not</strong> notify the user, to avoid the primary problem with ""private message"" and ""ping"" suggestions. Instead, the ""vouching"" user would have to notify the ""expert"" user out of band.</p>

"274251","How do I find an appropriate tag to use?","<p>Sometimes I have no idea what tag to use on my questions. I look at the ""popular tags"" list but none of them are appropriate. I type a few characters of some words that describe what my question is about but none of the suggestions are right either. Sometimes I'm lucky and a good tag will pop up because the three or four letters I typed in are in the middle of that tag, but this happens rarely.</p>

<p>Most of the time I will find a tag that sort-of fits and post my question. A lot of the time someone more knowledgeable than me will edit my question by adding the correct tags (and possibly removing the original tag). Should I keep doing this or is there some other way of finding appropriate tags that I'm not yet aware of?</p>

"274383","Comment hierarchy on SE","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>There are many questions on SE with the long and fruitful discussions in comments. Such discussions often involve replying to other commenters using <code>@username</code> approach</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Possibly, this is my subjective experience, but sometimes it is hard to follow which comment replies to which. Vice versa, it is sometimes hard to find the reply to the comment among a pile of others. For instance, the comments by Peter reply to the fist two commenters, but it takes some mental effort to understand this. To get clearer understanding of the discussion, reader needs to parse through the comments above and to restore the links. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/fYSYC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/fYSYC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Proposed solution - comment hierarchy</strong></p>

<p>There is nothing innovative in this feature request, some popular websites use this technique (e.g. Quora, Reddit, ). The example from Reddit is shown on the screenshot below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/gbUbQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gbUbQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As we can see, this solution provides several advantages for users compared to the existing structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indentation provides additional clarity for the reader</li>
<li>Eliminate the misspelling of <code>@username</code> and, thus, making sure that the right person is notified when gets a reply </li>
<li>Similarly, if the commenter forgets to add <code>@</code> the right person would still be notified</li>
<li>No need to see whether the question in comments received a reply or not</li>
<li>Parent and children comments are close to each other - so it is very easy to focus only on one aspect of discussion</li>
<li>If the comment receives more that one reply, it is much easier to track all replies</li>
<li>Ability to minimize the comment branches allow to focus on the single one, or just to save space on the page</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shortcomings</strong></p>

<p>Certainly, there are possible drawbacks of the solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>User cannot answer to several people. AFAIK  with the current system we can't either (notification is sent only to one)</li>
<li>Chronicity is partially lost, since it is not obvious when the comment was added. Can be mitigated by adding sorting options</li>
<li>The text shrinks as the replies go deeper, due to indent.</li>
<li>Lack of space for realization of modification</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the proposed modification would improve the user experience primarily because it would bring more structure to the discussions in comments. However, due to the possible opposition of experienced users, this feature may be added as option.</p>

As I understand it, a question being bumped to the top of active is saying ""Hey, community, something interesting/substantial happened to this question and you might want to check it out!"". In my opinion, tag edits are not substantial enough to make it worth bumping the question, as they are mostly janitorial edits.</p>

<p>Consider the following common reasons for editing a question's tags:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question was tagged incorrectly, by using an irrelevant tag or a combination of tags that don't make sense together</li>
<li>A tag that the question used has been retired or otherwise changed so that it no longer applies</li>
<li>A new tag has been created that would apply to the question, perhaps better than one or more of the current tags</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are janitorial edits - not substantial enough to warrant increased attention from the community, but rather something that needs to be done to keep the site clean.

<pre><code>Please provide an [mvce].

<p>And this will be replaced with the appropriate link. This is extremely convenient on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>However, lots of the smaller sites have their own frequently used help pages. For example, on one of the sites I'm most active on, Programming Puzzles and Code-Golf, we have a meta post called <a href=""http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/2140/sandbox-for-proposed-challenges/"">""The Sandbox""</a> where users can post challenges to get constructive feedback on how to make their challenge better. If I want to point a user to the sandbox, I have to open a new tab, search for the sandbox, copy and paste the url, and enter the hotlink syntax. It would be a lot more convenient if I could just write:</p>

<pre><code>You should try posting this challenge to the [sandbox].

<p>And the same idea is applicable on all of the smaller sites. Now, there are a lot of links like this that could be useful. Each site probably has a better picture of useful links for that site than anyone else would. </p>

"277102","Can we add the triple backticks feature for code formatting in markdown?","<p><sup>Disclaimer: My request is about using the same markdown format used in GitHub for code blocks and syntax highlighting.</sup></p>

<p>In most recent markdown formatters, other than the 4 space indentations, we can create code samples by <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">using triple ticks</a> before and after the code block, for example:</p>

<pre><code>```
this would become a code block
```
</code></pre>

<p>On the top of my head, I can think of 2 advantages:</p>

<h3>Line length</h3>

<p>Using backticks instead of the current format would allows us to gain 4 extra characters for each line of code inside the editor. I find this really advantageous as the editor currently allows 79 characters per line and 78 when the scroll bar is showing on the right.<br>
This is just around the 80 character limit which most programming languages suggest. Thus giving us back those 4 extra characters would be quite nice in my opinion.</p>

<p><em>I'm currently using Firefox on Ubuntu, but I don't believe the character count per line would be much different on a different browser/OS, probably 1 extra or less character per line</em>.</p>

<h3>Syntax Highlighting and ease of use</h3>

<p>Also, I find this style of formatting much simpler for use, especially when explicitly specifying the language for syntax highlighting. </p>

<p>Currently in SE, when we need to specify the language, we need to prepend the code block with the following unindented line <code>&lt;!-- language: js --&gt;</code> followed by empty line.<br>
Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- language: js --&gt;

    // JavaScript code
</code></pre>

<p>In contrast, using the triple backticks format, we would use the much simpler:</p>

<pre><code>```js
// JavaScript code
```
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, the format of the latter is much easier to remember.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm not asking to replace the current format with backticks, I'm asking if we can add this feature thus having 2 ways of formatting code.</p>

"278128","Power-tripping mods?","<p><strong>Read before you decide THIS question is off-topic</strong></p>

<p>I don't expext to get much sympathy on this one but.... </p>

<p>I posted my question on serverfault thinking it was for networking questions. Gets put on hold as off-topic, my mistake, no big deal, let's move on. (Also I didn't get notified of either hold or response to my subsequent flag for migrate. Not sure about flags but I know holds are supposed to show)</p>

<ul>
<li>Flag my question to be moved to site holding mod suggested it be moved to: denied with no explanation</li>
<li>I politely ask for a suggestion as to where to move and the reply? ""Frankly, this is a terrible question.  I won't put it anywhere else.""</li>
</ul>

<p>You could imagine 4 hours for such a helpful response and I was a bit peeved.  I had a specific question about a specific function of a uniquitous networking device and he was telling me, rather rudely, that it didn't belong anywhere on the ENTIRE stack network.  Didn't offer a single word as to why it was so terrible.  I illustrate, in kind, how that's not so helpful and question gets closed as ""too many off-topic comments.""  There were <strong>two</strong> comments by me: one about the relevant site and the other about the complaint (which was the only one he deletes, doesn't like being questioned I guess)</p>

<p>Just so my post can have a specific question</p>

<ul>
<li>I've heard of power-tripping mods here and was wondering just how bad it is.  I haven't had any other issues but I want to avoid it as much as possible.</li>
<li>I probably know who it was (no names) because of how the question was closed, but is there a specific way to know who responded to a flag request?  Again just to help avoid future situations.</li>
<li>Funny enough person who closed put another question of mine on hold yesterday, but I agreed it was too broad and deleted it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Relevance of THIS post:</strong>
If you think discussing moderator behaviour is not a meta topic we can have a separate debate on that.  If you think this belongs on meta.serverfault: this post wasn't about the specific question posted there - it was was about a moderator's behaviour and the context isn't specific to serverfault.  Also I'm new there and can't post to meta.</p>

<p>This is both confusing and frustrating.</p>

<p>People write questions on StackOverflow and they're told they have to open a new account (even if it's easy once the first is made, the thought of it can disturb most) on another website they've never heard of to ask their question. There is no indication that those websites exist. They have no indication that their question should be posted on another website.</p>

<p>I now even see SE sites on Arduino or Drupal development. What is wrong with merging those into a more general website? They have so much less questions than SO questions over Javascript or C. Why aren't there specific sites on Javascript or C, then? It makes absolutely no sense.</p>

<p>That's for the confusing part.</p>

<p>But SE sites are also frustrating because you're focused on your own problem which is to solve an answer and then what happens? People are nitpicking about which website your question should be posted on. This is just ridiculous: people take the time to nitpick about this nonsense and they don't help you because your question is not bad for this site but would be better on that one. It's just frustrating.</p>

<p>What should be done?</p>

<ul>
<li>Merge the websites meaningfully.</li>
<li>Use tags. Tags are useful and help everyone filter what they want and in search engines, they can scope the question.</li>
<li>Focus on giving a better experience to users rather than pushing on the nitpicking and dividing the community.</li>

As you can see in <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/135970/gin-san?tab=stats"">my area51 profile</a>, the Deep Web proposal doesn't show up in the <em>Current Commitment</em> or the <em>Followed</em> section.</p>

<p>According to all sources on the topic I found around here, the only way to access a private beta is having commited to the site prior to the beta or receiving an invitation from a commited member. I don't know any of the active participants of the Deep Web private beta, and I didn't get an invitation email either, but only the notification. So I doubt someone personally invited me.</p>

<p>So how did I get into that private beta?</p>

My efforts to entirely avoid Facebook, YouTube, Quora, Twitter and SFF.SE itself throughout today were ultimately, then, in vain.

<p>However unlike the question when being ""Viewed"", on the edit screen there is no tooltip hover info for the contents of a tag, and adding new tags will not repeat already mentioned tags, so for instance I just edited a question with the tag <code>mysql</code> and the question was about PDO, so I wanted to check that the <code>mysql</code> tag was relevant, as in if the tag itself mentioned </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""for PDO queries use the PDO tag"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(the type of direction many of SO tags <strong>do</strong> have)</em> </p>

<p>It seems I can't read the information of a tag unless I delete it from a question and then retype it, this is clearly deeply inefficient and leaves a very large area for human failure (deleting a correct tag and then forgetting to readd it, etc.) just to be able to read the tag contents. </p>

<p>I'm afraid I am unlikely to memorise the summary contents of every tag on Stack OVerflow.</p>

<p>As I (and I suspect many of us) edit questions for a wide variety of reasons it's also somewhat impractical to have to remember to check and hover each question's tag before editing the question. The editing of tags is not usually the primary reason I edit the question.</p>

<p><strong>So:<br>
Can chosen tags displayed on the ""edit question"" dialog please show the tag tooltip details for the chosen tag, as it does for when the question is viewed or first written.</strong></p>

<p>So, here is one idea: add a way to add references to questions or answers. References will be links-only. These links will stay on stackexchange and other sites from the family of sites and their servers will scan the links from times to times or links can be scanned every time a page is visited. Every 3 times a link is seen as 404 error it is removed automatically from the links section.</p>

"283153","How to be more polite and accommodating?","<p>Here's my beef. I've noticed over the past couple of days, and even before I joined this (the StackExchange) community that most of you aren't kind to your fellow user. I'm not trying to get up on a soap-box here, I'm just calling things how I see them.</p>

<p>For instance (and this is an issue throughout the various communities here, not just one particular one) - you all seem to be trigger happy when it comes to flagging duplicates. I think this practice is wrong, not to mention unethical. Here's why:</p>

<p>I speak Spanish as a second language and know that the words 'por' and 'para' are very hard for Spanish learners to understand and grasp, due to their variant meanings, sometimes by the sentence, sometimes by the word pair, and sometimes by the country in which they are used. So it's very important that a variety of examples are given to help teach students of the language what they mean, when, and how.</p>

<p>This means that no question is a stupid question, and no question is a duplicate question, necessarily. For example, in the two sentences below, the word 'por' means virtually the same thing, but without the context, word pairs, or phrasing, it changes completely.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anya nadó por el canal en junio.

<ul>
<li>Translates to: Anya swam the canal in June. (As in, she swam <em>through</em> it.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Anya nadó por el canal en junio.

<ul>
<li>Translates to: Anya swam by the canal in June. (As in, she swam near it, but not in it.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The two sentences are completely different, but also completely the same. If the reader of the question doesn't pay attention to context (like they say they do, and as they seem to put so much emphasis on), you might end up with a wrong translation to English or whatever language it is they [the asker] speak fluently and understand best.</p>

<p>For instance, in some languages, 'where' is a place, more so than <a href=""https://www.en.wiktionary.org/wiki/where"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it is in English</a> as it is currently used. In some languages, the word 'it' is part of other words or implied from context, so English learners may not write them out since it makes sense not to in their language. Other times, they just have a bad teacher who they themself doesn't understand the language they're teaching, and thus gives them bad translations from the get-go.</p>

<p>If you want real-life examples from StackExchange, you can search for such things as 'the difference between' and '<a href=""https://www.en.wiktionary.org/wiki/how"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">how</a> to say this ...?' on the appropriate forums. There are about ten or so more different variations for each question, but they are just that - variation. They are not the same question. Each question should be handled individually based on the phrasing, not the content.</p>

<ul>
<li>In other words, you need to analyze how <em>how</em> is being used, because it has a lot of different meanings, and what you think the asker means may not be what they mean at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>This also happens with StackOverflow, for example. I'm not the best coder, so I often want to ask the reason why something is done, but I avoid doing so at the risk that my question might be closed, neglected, or made fun of by more experienced (even professional) coders who might go, ""Well, duh. Of course you should put <code>""""</code> after <code>div</code>, it just makes sense. It's what you do."" Well, why? Don't just tell me it's how the computer reads it. I don't care about that, really. I know the computer reads it because it's code, duh! Why does it read it that way? Why not another? How is it useful?</p>

<p>The snarky comments don't make it any fun or more helpful than say, Yahoo!Answers with its simplistic format and network. Don't people come to SE for more information, preferably high-quality?</p>

<p><strong>So my question is thus: How can we improve site features and user etiquette among other things to make the experience better for everyone?</strong> </p>

<p>No problems in that except that as I have read in the Reputation system of SO, it is written that on cancelling the downvote to the

a subjective thing. This could lead to good loss of reputation of OP. I don't think many community members know of this rule.</p>

Now, I do realize that my device, a Polaroid L9, isn't a very popular model, so it may be difficult to test for. I suspect that this may have something to do with a discrepancy between the device's physical dimensions and actual resolution/dpi, and the display size (s/m/l/xl) and density (ldpi/mdpi/hdpi/vhdpi) that the device reports itself as having - I suspect that it's actual resolution is on the low side, and it likes to use some custom rendering to ""fake"" a higher resolution, because, for example, the stock home screen displays all app icons properly, but the Google Now Launcher displays some apps' icons as slightly ""out of focus"", as if it uses the next smaller size icon resource and scales it up.
Anyway, everything else in the app looks perfectly normal, but this issue occurs regardless of orientation and whether the left-hand tray is expanded or collapsed.</p>

(I searched and found a lot of questions and answers about crossposting <em>questions</em> but none for answers.) I often encounter a situation where:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are duplicate questions on one or more Stack Exchange sites</li>
<li>Some these questions are linked together through the ""duplicate questions"" notices</li>
<li>Some of these questions are locked</li>
<li>Possibly some of the questions have good, comprehensive answers</li>
</ul>

<p>In some of the cases where the above happens, there are sometimes isolated questions without good answers even when good answers exist on some of the questions. In other cases, no good answer exists, but the questions are still scattered. For me, this creates a situation where I'm not sure where to post an answer even if I am confident I can answer a question well.</p>

<p>My question is about what to do in such situations. Is it okay to crosspost the same answer on all the duplicate questions? Is it okay to make one the canonical answer and link to it from the other questions?</p>

<p>One of the question was answered by a really not that good of an answer (so the question is closed, but that answer is the only one to show), and the second question had no answer at all.</p>

<p>Now if someone will see the first question and its answer, he will be giving the sense that this answer is ok to work with it, and no one can give other answers, or they won't bother as that question is closed, so those users will be using the wrong way. </p>

<p>The second answer is actually more important, because the question had actually couple of right answers, and couple of right ways to do what the OP wanted, but the duplicate that was linked to it was a specific one way (the OP asked for a specific way to do it, so i can't answer with the other way to do it as it won't be answering the question), but again, because the question is closed, no one will bother answering it or take a look if its really a duplicate?</p>

<p>I don't have enough points to comment or chat, so i can't do anything about it, but SO is about helping people to understand code, the first question was a typo of the OP and needed exactly 2 lines to answer it (first line the code, and second is where his problem was), the second question had few answers but yet the duplicate only specifically talking about one of those answers.</p>

"288000","Hacking my profile and changing it","<p>I noticed a few weeks ago that my StackExchange profile had been hacked, and that my original one line of text had been overridden and replaced with malicious text.</p>

<p>Earlier today I over-wrote that malicious text with an extended 2991-character new profile, but now I've found that that the cockroach (program??) had shit on my brand new profile again, and with the same malicious text.</p>

<p>I had really been looking forward to working with other StackExchange members in the (currently) nine SE websites that I'm registered in, but with a cockroach on the loose happily deleting and replacing my profile with the cockroach's poop, the only alternative I can see is for me to click on the SE icon on my desktop, pull that icon down to that ""wastebasket"" icon down there in the lower right hand corner of my desktop, and drop the SE icon into it.  Then next, I will delete the SE program entirely from my computer.</p>

<p>I really have liked SE, but I've been personally attacked in the Russian Language forum by a cockroach going by the name of ""Artimex"", who may or may not be the source behind the malicious attack on my Profile.  But be that as it may, I'm not taking any chances on the cockroach that's running around in your program corrupting the rest of my computer.</p>

<p>Any help before I say ""<em>au revoir</em>"" and ""<em>доствданя</em>"" to  you all, and then delete SE from my computer?</p>

<p>As you will see the grey banner is different on the two images showing my profile picture in the screenshot above.</p>

It should also be noted that when I uploaded the new profile picture it appeared as completely blank (white) in the settings where one clicks to upload a new one. The image I uploaded is a jpg.</p>

<p>I asked someone else if they could check, and they <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34053173#34053173"">said</a> that they could also see the grey banner, though not in the places where I can see it.</p>

<p>I believe that this happened before, in the past in order to get a picture with no grey banner at the bottom I had to reupload it several times, fortunately however I only had to reupload it once in this instance.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to have the <code>/review</code> page auto-refresh counts, and display the new values live as they come in. For example, a new Suggested Edit is available, the number for Suggested Edits should instantly jump up.</p>

<p>In the same vein, if I'm not on the Review tab, a little notification counter, like on Chat, should be present, counting up for each new review item added since I've last visited the tab:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/m2BbH.png"" alt=""(1) Review - Ask Ubuntu""></p>

Well, OK, full of ideas, some of which might be great.  If you squint hard enough. I frequently think up feature requests for SE, because I'm a frequent user.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I decide to stop being lazy and actually come to Meta.SE to post the feature I thought up as a request.</p>

<p>9 times out of 10 (or more often), I discover that someone already thought up the same feature before, and there's an older request for the same thing posted. With no sign of <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-declined"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-declined</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/status-completed"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;status-completed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">status-completed</a> or response from SE team.</p>

<p>Now, there are ways to get extra attention to existing SE (including Meta) posts, but my working assumption here is, that's a fool's work.

When there is background colour, I can see the question in the list or even open it, but there is no change following this.  What am I missing here?

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Xn7th.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Xn7th.png"" alt=""1""></a></p>

<p>Obviously, the dialogue appears below the banners, which it clearly should not do. It also has no input focus, trying to interact with the dialogue fails and either closes it (clicking outside of the red banners) or reloads the page (clicking on the red banners).</p>

<p>The cause for this is simply the z-index ordering in the site's CSS. Relevant CSS snippets:</p>

<pre><code>.realtime-post-deleted-notification {
    position: absolute;
    text-align: center;

.popup {

"294622","Beginners tag for Stack Overflow?","<p>I have no idea if this is the place to discuss this, but here goes.</p>

<p>I am looking for opinions on what people would think about having a <code>beginners</code> tag or something else similar.</p>

<p>I am posting this from personal experience with this site in my effort to learn to code.</p>

<p>OK, so a little about myself. I started programming in VBA for a need to make Excel more powerful for my work related issues. This went well for many years and I got a good grasp of VBA. The help sites for Excel are wide and deep and most are your typical forum style where you can have a good back and forth to discuss your issue so as you can solve it. </p>

<p>That is when I decided that I wanted to learn C# in my spare time for fun, knowing full well that I will never ever really use it in the future. Initially, there is plenty of resources and being a member of Lynda.com I was able to make my first calculator. That  was great, but then I tried to move into more difficult areas such as linking a UI to a <code>DataBase</code> and that is where things got really hard really fast. Doing as much research as I can 99% of the searches retrieve SO questions and documentation. Which can be very hard to understand when you have no experience, especially the formal documentation.</p>

<p>Great you say, well not really. Being that I did not know much of the technical jargon for what I was trying to do, so searching for an answer was almost impossible, but I plugged on.</p>

<h2>The issue:</h2>

<p>This is when I first started asking questions here, admittedly to the trained person, my questions were badly formed and hard to understand, but in my defense, this is b/c I had no formal training and I had no idea what I was doing, but I DID know what I needed and that was someone to show me what I was doing wrong. I have learnt quite a bit since then and I still ask questions where I am not sure if I have posted too much code or too little, but I can spend up to an hour forming a a question researching the correct terms to use in the question and to form a minimal code example so as someone can quickly and easily identify the issue. But, I must admit, I still don't know enough to know if that is what I am really doing. </p>

<p>Through all this, down votes where a given, not that bothers me me I am not here for rep, but to learn as I really do enjoy coding in my spare time. Also the comments were also a given <code>read the documentation</code>, <code>all you want is the answer</code>. In fact I had a discussion with a high rep user who literally accused me of just wanting code and to just go hire someone to do the work for me. (Which I really have to laugh at, since I am doing this in my spare time for fun and having someone just write code for me is just beyond ludicrous considering my motives for coding in C#)Unfortunately I can't find the comments in that discussion right now. </p>

<h2>So to sum up my question, it would be really nice if there could be a <code>beginers</code> tag as it would help do the following:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Allow more experienced users to filter out questions they don't want to answer.</li>
<li>This would allow users to better pick and choose the answers they want to really focus on.</li>
<li>Allow a new user the benefit of the doubt when asking a question they might not know how to word correctly.</li>
<li>Allow other users to overlook the usual stance taken to a poorly formatted question, <strong>but</strong> give the new user the chance to observe the guidelines here without the usual backlash of harsh down votes.</li>
<li>And the final point of making the site a little more friendly to new users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now if my thoughts are way off, please do say so by posting an answer with your views. I understand the initial reason for starting this site, but argue that things are supposed to mature and change with the changing environment which I also think applies to SO. I am looking for constructive feed back to an issue that I have struggled with on this site from the get go, as this is the best I can do to sum up my feelings towards this. Looking forward to what people have to say.</p>

"294663","Protected questions and overall SO network reputation","<p>I recently wanted to give an answer on an SO platform, but instead had to write a comment.</p>

<p>The weird thing is, that I think the comment would have been a decent answer, which in turn could bump me well above the threshold to answer protected questions.</p>

<p>I also have the 100 rep bonus, and 1900 reputation or more overall on the SO network.</p>

<p>I think it would be cool if a user with enough reputation say 1000 or 1500 overall on the SO network (real reputation not with the bonus counted), could still answer protected questions.</p>

<p>The reason is that I think it's unlikely that someone with a lot of reputation would write a bad answer on another SO platform.</p>

<p>I don't know if it can be implemented though and what each SO platform has access to.</p>

<p>I mean you can still give the information in a comment, or ask someone in chat to post it for you, but you will forfeit the potential gain of reputation, which then would allow you to answer future protected questions (which are the ones you are most likely to see, because you're likely not actively search on that particular network, but instead only see the hot networks)</p>

<p>Ofcourse you could argue that this is design, but somehow I think that this could prevent a few people which could post gem answers for specific situation/contexts they are familiar with, but are simply not active on that network.</p>

<p>10% of the HNQ is devoted to a niche site which doesn't really represent what this network is about (Q&amp;A, not puzzles set to the community).</p>

<p>A lot of people here might not browse the HNQ list that often. For anyone on iOS mobile, there is a widget to show you HNQs, and the homepage (Feed) shows them. It's also the homepage of Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Please add an artificial limit to the HNQ formula to either make it harder for PPCG questions to get on the list, or limit it to (say) 3 on the list. 10% of the list devoted to one site is excessive.</p>

<p>While the HNQ list creates a lot of cross-site traffic (which is wanted), it also causes issues on those sites sometimes, in particular on sites like <a href=""https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/"">PuzzlingSE</a> where the 'hotness' of some questions strongly distorts the ""voting = quality"" paradigm.</p>

<p>However, I'm not about <em>fixing HNQ</em> here.

( See also: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/295727/267654"">What stats should I track in an HNQ list monitor?</a> )</p>

<p>And if not, I would like to propose this as a general feature request.

<li>If I click ""About"", I'm taken to a whole new page.</li>

<p>These two links look exactly alike, and I can't tell what will happen if I click one of the links.
After scratching my head for a moment and looking at the URL when hovering over various links, I figured out how it works.
But it'd be better if it was easier than that.
Also, inconsistent links are irritating.</p>

<p><strong>Could the links in the last column (Technology, Life / Arts, Culture / Recreation, Science, Other) have some kind of visual clue that they are different from the rest of the footer links?</strong>

"298052","Earning reputation by downvoting?","<p>I found a way to earn reputation by downvoting. Specifically: If I downvote a post, then wait a while, then un-downvote the post, my net reputation count increases by 1. </p>

<p>Here's why it's happening. Two days ago, I posted an answer to <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2345327/is-being-a-right-triangle-both-necessary-and-sufficient-for-the-pythagorean-theo"">this</a> question on math.SE. It became a ""hot"" network question and I quickly reached my daily reputation limit. Thus, the question kept getting upvoted, but I wasn't earning reputation for it (as it should be). </p>

<p>Today, I once again reached my daily reputation limit. After reaching this limit, I downvoted a post on math.SE. So, my daily earned reputation was effectively 199. The next time somebody upvoted my question, I gained +1 reputation. <strong>But then, I retracted the downvote.</strong> To my surprise, I gained another +1 reputation. </p>

<p>Here is the data on the reputation I gained today:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/qXBJs.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/qXBJs.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Usually, I would have earned 215 in total: 200 reputation from upvotes and 15 from one accepted answer. But instead I earned 216 because I gained the extra +1 from retracting the downvote after already being ""reimbursed"".</p>

<p>Obviously, this trick isn't widely applicable. A user has to already have reached their reputation cap. And due to the limit of 40 votes per day, they would only be able to use this trick to earn a maximum of 40 bonus reputation points per day. I realize I'm not the first to point out inconsistencies in the voting system (see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48116/2-pts-refund-from-a-retracted-downvote-is-cap-exempt"">this</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2241/daily-reputation-cap-effectively-counts-downvotes-twice"">this</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/504/why-is-the-inconsistent-reputation-system-by-design?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">this</a>). But as far as I can tell, this is the first instance where it is possible for a user to reliably game the system to earn 40 reputation per day without making any contributions. </p>

Similarly, in the away column, the two that were migrated away don't note where they were migrated to. In this case, they were both migrated to ELU. </p>

<p>A few months ago we noticed an <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/293038/why-is-one-migration-showing-up-as-to-a-blank-site"">odd migration error similar to this that was related to the Meta URL change</a>. I don't think this is related because these questions aren't from Meta to Main site, they are between sites.</p>

"298090","Bug or Feature in Audit ""STOP! Look and Listen.""? Answer to review in audit not visible outside audit","<p>I just got access to the review queues (late answers). I tried to be thorough and opened the question in a new tab, since the answer I should review was odd and I thought maybe someone just copied an old comment or something. I wanted to see the whole context to write an informed comment to that answer since the user who committed it was new.</p>

<p>The question didn't have the answer I saw for review nor did it have any other comments on it from other reviewers and I thought: ""Oh, thats weird.""
I waited some time and reloaded the tab with the question - the answer did not show up, so I clicked on ""No action needed."" (Obviously, the answer was not visible like in reviews I did previously, so why bother? And I did not skip it since I did a review after all.)</p>

<p>I got the </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>STOP! Look and Listen.</p>
  
  <p>This was an audit, designed to see if you were paying attention. You
  didn't pass. This answer was of very poor quality, and needed
  significant improvements to be useful – passing over such posts hurts
  the ability of others to find and answer good questions. Please try to
  fix such posts by editing, downvoting, closing, or flagging as ""very

<p>dialog.</p>

<p>I think that the answer to review is not shown under the question when having an audit is a bug. Or are there real situations where the item to review is not visible for the reviewer outside of the review tab?</p>

<p>Furthermore now I'm uncertain how to do reviews. Usually when I see a poor answer or question which was already downvoted 5 times and has 3 similar comments about poor quality I press ""No action needed"" too. I don't want to skip, since I did a review and I think a fourth poor quality comment does not add any more value.</p>

<p>For me personally, this is almost never the desired behaviour. I want to read the contents of the room, joining a room is an entirely separate decision for me. I almost never join a room unless I intend to participate in the discussion.</p>

<p>This behaviour is for one surprising, I don't think everyone expects that they'll be publicly joining a particular chat room just by following a link. This is made even worse by the ""convert comments to chat"" function, which leaves chat links scattered on the main sites. I can't just read the converted comments, I have to join the chat because it's the only link there (unless I manually try to find the room). For me this means that I never actually follow the links to chat unless it's something really important to me.</p>

<p>Joining a chat room is an active action to me, not something that should automatically happen without the user's consent. It has privacy implications, other users get notified that you're looking at that chat room at that specific point in time. It can also provoke reactions, suddenly I'm greeted by someone I don't know because they noticed I entered that room. As I'm a moderator they might also suspect that there is some kind of trouble which caused me to enter that room.</p>

<p>Following a link to a chat room should not automatically make you join that room. The easiest way would be to just redirect to the transcript, but that could be confusing for people that aren't familiar with SE chat. The other option would be to still go to the live chat page, but without joining chat. So the bar at the bottom would have a big ""join this chat room"" button instead of the message box.</p>

you should keep that privilege forever, even if you drop below
the reputation threshold that granted you that privilege
— especially if you lose the reputation by issuing a bounty. 
I support this request — it seems like a minor code change
to treat privileges like badges, with a bitmap
where bits get set when you reach a threshold and never get unset —
but I know that that request has been consistently declined,
so I’m not making it again.</p>

<p>But I do want to identify an edge case that has not been cited before,
to the best of my recollection. 
This is not a hypothetical scenario; it happened yesterday.</p>

<ol>
<li>Super User question <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/1138045/150988"">Since upgrade from Linux 4.6 to (4.7, 4.8),
%CPU is always 0; the frequency is unknown</a> has been idle for 10 months. 
(The OP, <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/441117/skywalker13"">Skywalker13</a>, did edit it 9 months ago. 
Also, the OP posted an update as an “answer”
the same day he asked the question, and deleted it less than two hours later.)</li>
<li>Yesterday, <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/663451/toyonos"">User ToYonos</a> set a bounty of 100 points on the question
(saying “A detailed canonical answer is required …”,
although the question doesn’t really have <em>any</em> answer
except “don’t use a current version of Linux;
find a version that’s old enough that it doesn’t have the problem,
and use that.”)</li>
<li>ToYonos is a 4½-year veteran of Stack Overflow, with over 7K rep there,
but is relatively new to Super User and has not earned any rep there
(except for the association bonus).</li>
<li>Do the math. 
ToYonos had 101 rep on Super User, so he had “comment everywhere” privilege. 
But he spent 100 rep on the bonus, leaving him with only 1
— so he <em>lost</em> the commenting privilege.  …</li>
<li>… so he can’t comment on the question where he set the bounty. 
If he had thought to do so,
he could have commented on it <em>before</em> he created the bounty; now he can’t.</li>
</ol>

<p>To add insult to injury,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two hours after ToYonos started the bounty,
Super User’s <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/8672/harrymc"">highest reputation user</a> posted <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/1138045/150988#comment1824671_1138045"">a comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@ToYonos: Since you are not the original poster,
  could you please give some details about your problem.
  and why doesn’t the solution in the post fit your case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is especially ironic since, as I said,
there <em>isn’t</em> a constructive answer.</p></li>
<li>ToYonos posted <a href=""https://superuser.com/q/1138045/150988#1244059"">an answer</a> (now 10K-only):

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry I don’t have enough rep here so I will post an answer.</p>
  
  <p>The OP seems to have ""fix"" his issue downgrading to Linux 4.4.33. 
  I don’t want this, I’d rather have an explanation and/or a proper solution.</p>
  
  <p>My issue is quite the same, <code>top</code> giving zeros in <code>%CPU</code> and <code>%MEM</code> columns,
  <code>cpupower frequency-info</code> giving the same result.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Another <a href=""https://superuser.com/users/83283/ramhound"">highly active SU user</a> zapped a couple of comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This should have been submitted as a comment.
  While you are unable to submit comments until you have 50 reputation.
  Commentary submitted as an answer will be deleted by the community.
  Answers and questions which are not well received
  (comments submitted as an answer are not well received)
  count against your ability,
  to submit new questions and answers in the future even if they are deleted</p>
  
  <p>Since you have an issue, its not possible for us to help you,
  so your question will remain unanswered unless you ask your own question. 
  I caution you from asking your question as-is
  because it lacks enough detail to actually answer it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… and ToYonos deleted the answer about half an hour later.</p>

<p>This is adding insult to injury.</p>

<ul>
<li>As I said, ToYonos <em>had</em> over 100 rep,
and he <em>had</em> “comment everywhere” privilege, before he set the bounty.</li>
<li>“Since you have an issue, its not possible for us to help you, …” 
Huh?  Why not? 
ToYonos isn’t asking people to answer his answer;
he’s asking them to answer <strong><em>Skywalker13’s question</strong>.</em></li>
<li>“I caution you from asking your question as-is
because it lacks enough detail to actually answer it.” 
Yeah, sure, if you look at ToYonos’s “answer” as if it were a question,
then it’s not answerable. 
But ToYonos is asking people to answer Skywalker13’s question,
which is over 150 lines (over 1000 words) long
(although about 70% of that is output from commands). 
It seems to be detailed enough.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary,</p>

<ul>
<li>ToYonos has earned the privilege to post comments. 
He has earned that and more on Stack Overflow,
and he subsequently earned it by association on Super User when he joined.</li>
<li>Arguably, ToYonos has invested more in this question than anybody else. 
(OK, Skywalker13 (the OP) may have invested more time and energy,
but ToYonos has invested 100 points of rep.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can always comment on your own posts. 
Setting a bounty on a question
should give you enough of a stake in that question
to allow you to comment on that question, as if you had asked it.</p>

<p>But the difference that annoys me the most is that the SE top-bar is not sticky. The SO top bar is sticky by default; the SE one doesn't even have an <em>option</em> to be sticky.</p>

<p>The whole point of expanding the top-bar to other SE sites is to make the sites all consistent with one another. But for those of us who use SO primarily, there's no consistency. On one site, we have instant access to our ""inbox"", network sites, and so forth. On every other site, you have to scroll up to the top of the page to see that.</p>

<p>Could we make the SE top bar at least be able to share the same <em>position</em> as the SO top bar? It doesn't have to be the default, but having the option for consistency would be nice.</p>

"301427","Is there a way to get just my privilege to (in)validate flags in chat revoked?","<p>Because I have 40.3K rep across all Stack Exchange sites, I get that blue orb above my avatar whenever someone flags something in chat, with the options to validate or invalidate a chat flag.</p>

<p>I don't want that pressure. I don't have the social capabilities to judge whether a flag is valid or not, especially in those cases where there is no clear violation of chat rules. Something like curses or offensive language I can just about judge that it's a valid flag. But more often than not, I simply cannot personally judge whether the flag is valid or invalid, and I feel like it's a waste of a potential flag judging to let me judge them. Especially considering the ""Not sure"" option actually is closer to ""a little bit invalid"" than it is to ""don't ask me"".</p>

<p>On top of that, there is the issue of emotional instability. Due to the inherent nature of a feature used to moderate offensive messages, nearly every message which appears in a blue orb is offensive content. People who use offensive language, or who voice racist or sexist opinions, or showcase political extremism.</p>

<p>I don't want to see stuff like that. The world right now is going through some rough patches, with terrorism, political extremism and highly flammable rhetoric from many sides. I'm already emotionally much more susceptible to bad news, and my happy/sad scale rarely measures above the neutral level. I'm not depressed, mind you, but I'm not happy either. I use the Bridge, the chat room I am a regular of, as a sort-of refuge from the worst of what's happening out there. </p>

<p>Having those offensive messages from the flags appear on my screen on a regular level confronts me with the negative sides of the world, and it moves my scale closer to the sad level. I fear that too much of that negative stuff will make me sad, and eventually depressed. I obviously don't want that.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can say ""stop giving me flag requests, because I can't handle them, both in the ""I don't know what to do with them"" and the ""they're too much for me to handle mentally"" senses""?</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the page for a question, any question, any question at all.</li>
<li>Open the same question in an additional tab, or coordinate with an additional user to do so.</li>
<li>In the second tab, make an edit to the question.</li>
<li>In the first tab, note that the ""an edit has been made"" bar appears at the top. <em>Do not dismiss this.</em></li>
<li>In the first tab, click the ""flag"" action link below the question text. <strong>Expected result:</strong> Flag dialog should open. <strong>Observed behavior:</strong> The question text is refreshed with the edit, but the flag dialog does not open.</li>
<li>In the first tab, immediately click the ""flag"" action link again. <strong>Observed behavior:</strong> An error message appears that you can only open the flag dialog once every three seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The workaround</strong> is easy: just wait those few seconds and try again.</p>

<p><strong>I'm suggesting</strong> that instead of as observed in step 5 above, the text should be refreshed and a message should be displayed to the user encouraging them to reconsider the flag in light of the edit now visible, but that this does not count as actually opening the flag dialog.</p>

<p>One example:<br></p>

<h1>This is a headline.</h1>

<p>The vertical space visually connecting a headline to the previous paragraph is shorter than the vertical space relating it to the following content. But the following content and the headline form one semantic unit. At least in my reasoning they should be.</p>

<p>Looks to me as if visual layout units are disrupting semantic content units.</p>

<p>Shouldn't this be the other way around – more space separating the previous content a from such an element of order, and optically less space than that to unify headline and following content?</p>

<p>I haven't counted the pixels, but to me it looks as if baselines or x-height are used to calculate equidistance and the effect I see is caused by optically protruding elements?</p>

<p>Then questions can be improved without annoying somebody.</p>

<p>While there is a point in getting more reviews of edits, this prevents at least implicitly by discouraging them through complaining users drive by edits, where I for example cannot really help with the question, but correct some minor issues like wrong tags or spelling errors.

<p>Sometimes the OP asks about this (<a href=""https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2258/106"">immediate prompt for this question</a>).  I've been asked occasionally about my self-deletions, and as a moderator I'm asked somewhat frequently about deleted answers.</p>

<p>We all have an interest in the question but the OP has a <em>bigger</em> interest.  Could we allow the OP to see deleted answers to his question regardless of his rep?  The interface would be exactly the same as for 10k users.  Some behaviors are already different for the OP (for example, commenting on all answers), so it seems feasible to check not just reputation but post ownership.  If that's too expensive, though, then maybe we could add some sort of ""click to see deleted answers"" for the OP if there are deleted answers?  I'm looking for a way to satisfy the OP's curiosity without having to ask 10k users or moderators about it.</p>

"304487","Editing the same post twice in First Posts or Late Answers takes me out of the queue","<p>On a site where I have less than 2k reputation, I suggested an edit to a post in the First Posts or Late Answers queue. The first time I click the Edit button under the post and then save my edits, everything works as it should. But then after I've submitted my edit, I noticed that I missed something in my edit. Then I clicked on the Edit button again to edit the things I've missed. When I clicked Save Edits again, it took me out of the review queue to the question page.</p>

<p>I also tested this on a site where I have more than 2k reputation, and everything works fine there.</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review First Posts or Late Answers on a site where you have less than 2k reputation</li>
<li>Suggest an edit to the post and submit your edit by clicking the Save Edits button</li>
<li>Click the Edit button again on the same post after submitting the edit</li>
<li>Do some more changes to your edit and click the Save Edits button again</li>

<p>I wasn't the only one. The same message was sent to a couple of other GDSE users. We have the following common factor: The moderator and his supporters think that we write far too easily answers to ""How do I get this result in Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape etc..."" -type questions. He confirmed it to me in the discussion.</p>

<p>The number of those answers isn't small. That's because the number of those questions isn't small. They flow in faster than the moderator and his high rank supporters can close them with flagging, so most of them get answers. Some of us have earned with them 1000 points of rep/month. That's a big number and probably unachievable for many of us if we had answered only to more demanding questions.</p>

<p>The moderator and his supporters have taken the opinion ""How to"" questions are mostly low level junk and do not earn answers. Only those which are based on questioner's own attempts and some specific problem during those attempts earn to get answers. If the questioner hasn't achieved anything or keeps it hided, he should get nothing. (Request of free work gets the same treatment)</p>

<p>The moderator and his supporters claim that we invite ""how to"" questions to flood in => GDSE isn't interesting to those who are interested in more demanding things in Graphics.</p>

<p>I am interested as well in technical ""How to"" subjects as more demanding things. I believe the moderator and his high rank supporters have a plan to get more effective tools to keep ""How to"" questions out. Those tools would be effective against any topic and would be a serious threat to still existing pluralism.</p>

<ul>
<li>We only allow evidence-based answers</li>
<li>We allow very controversial questions on inflammatory topics (e.g. school shootings)</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that  people avoid the ""evidence"" rule by abusing comments to write ""pseudo-answers""--usually, in fact, their personal opinions, without any evidence to back that up. Of course this often leads to flame wars, with people literally insulting each other, and often even purging all the comments does not prevent the flame from restarting soon later.</p>

<p>So we do moderate the comments by asking people to calm down. We do moderate the comment threads by nuking them all when things are out of control. Yet, in some <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40718/are-violent-video-games-a-better-explanation-of-school-shootings-than-access-to"">cases</a> we have to go through 2-3-4 cycles of ""purge all comments"".</p>

<p><strong>It would be useful to have the power to prevent commenting on a post altogether for a limited time.</strong> A simple ""lock"" would penalize the OP without any reason. We can certainly do <em>without this feature</em>, but this would be a real time saver.

I've experienced all of the aforementioned outcomes already, but what will happen after I click the Post Your Question button, is a dice roll for me. Too many times I though a question would be a good one, only to see it downvoted and closed. Too many times I was asking a question, thinking ""oops, I fear they're not going to like it, but I need the answer so badly, I'll just give it a try, maybe someone answers me before it is closed, a couple of downvotes now won't likely get me questionbanned"", only to see the question highly upvoted, and maybe even among the Hot Network Questions.</p>

<p>I used to try to argue for some closed questions in the meta and / or asking what did people not like in them. I stopped doing this as well, mainly because it's too time and energy consuming (and unlikely to get me an answer). Also because I've noticed that, over the Internet and real life alike, people tend to really get annoyed when I try to argue, and I wouldn't like to get a notorious reputation here.

<p>Say, this is what I am looking for: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pandas number of subgroups for each group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's see which one of the following three methods will return better search results.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search"">SO search bar</a>, and type it in there. It returns only one result, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42195515/pandas-groupby-operation-with-missing-data"">that result</a> is really not an answer to what we are looking for.</li>
<li>Try <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask"">""Ask Question""</a>, and type it in there, and you'll see that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41665965/pandas-number-of-subgroups-per-index"">the first result that comes out</a> is perfectly what that search query would be looking for!</li>
<li>Go to <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google</a>, and search like this: <code>site:stackoverflow.com pandas number of subgroups for each group</code>, and the first result is again that useful post.</li>

Hey, that's the same question, but on the app, it's kinda hard to notice you're on a <em>different site</em>; they all look the same. I clicked the 'share' link, copied the URL to the clipboard, went back to the Meta Stack Overflow question and voted to close the question as a duplicate. In the app, you then get a popup asking for the ID or URL of the duplicate target. I pasted <code>https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/307784/295232</code> and it was promptly closed (because of my <a href=""/questions/tagged/support"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">support</a> dupehammer) as a duplicate of question 307784 on Meta Stack Overflow.</p>

However, my question was put on hold as <code>too broad</code> which is something I would never want to do and it looks like I am one of the people who voted for it.

Duplicate Votes = 1</p>

<p>But isn't the idea of Stack Exchange posts that they answer questions for everyone who might find them in the future? Why should they care about which part has been added as an edit? Shouldn't we strive to change our post to incorporate the new information in a natural way and deleting obsolete parts of the post?</p>

"310426","Is it wrong to edit your own old answer to reflect changes in the technology when another user's answer already does this?","<p>So I have a slight ethical issue.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I answered <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28659845/swift-how-to-get-the-indexpath-row-when-a-button-in-a-cell-is-tapped/29792963#29792963"">this</a> question with what I believed at the time to be a good answer. I had just started out in my field (iOS Development) at the time and was chuffed that I was able to assist another developer so early into my own career.</p>

<p>As my career progressed and my knowledge grew, I became more aware of the pitfalls of using an approach such as the one I suggested in my answer. This was also pointed out by a couple of other users who suggested better approaches in alternative answers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people who visit an SO question usually grab the answer with the most upvotes (generally new users/programmers), which is mine, given that it's been there the longest, meaning that they are potentially setting themselves up for said pitfalls they could avoid by simply taking another answer.</p>

<p>This seemed like madness to me, so I edited my <strong>original</strong> answer to explain the pitfalls of the approach and suggest my new favourite alternative approach. I made sure to suggest that the reader scrolls down in the thread and browse the host of suggestions from different users, as most of them are valid.</p>

<p>Now it should be noted that this isn't about reputation at this stage; it's a case of 'my answer is what 80% of people will take and I want their code to be solid'. That said, others in the thread suggested <strong>the same thing I edited into my answer, first</strong>. Does that mean I'm capitalising on their efforts unfairly?</p>

<p>This is where my problem lies. I'm torn between the dilemma of potentially absolving others of well deserved reputation, and knowingly allowing users to use potentially unpredictable code. I considered straight up deleting my answer, but I think it serves as a valuable lesson, particularly for new developers, as to why approaches such as that are not best.</p>

<p>Would love to hear the community's thoughts on this one.</p>

However, in those sites that tag is a synonym to either <a href=""https://es.meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/discusi%C3%B3n""><code>discusión</code></a> (in SOes) or <a href=""https://pt.meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/debate""><code>debate</code></a> (in SOpt).

In that thread they say it's fine to use a mod attention flag if you want to clarify the reason you're flagging; for example, you might be flagging ""not an answer"", but want to explain why the answer isn't an answer. This use is also covered in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/310638/145982"">Should a custom flag be used instead of the &quot;not an answer&quot; flag when the answer isn&#39;t a blatant non-answer?</a>.</p>

<p>However, whether or not a post is obviously not an answer is subjective, and you can end up in the weird case where you think a post isn't an answer, you use a mod flag to explain why, and it gets rejected because the post was <em>too obviously</em> not an answer to warrant that flag -- you should have used the standard flag instead.</p>

<p>My opinions on that practice aside, it seems like it could be avoided if it were possible to provide a description for the standard flags and not just mod attention flags:</p>

"312354","Voting lock mechanism for near simultaneous answers","<p>I have the following scenario:
A question was made and now 2 users start writing an answer before the other ever posted it.

But now the first user down vote the second answer, just because. </p>

"312624","Can we separate out privileges from reputation?","<p>My question revolves around the fact that reputation is an ambiguous term that doesn't allow for things like: infamous people with correct answers.</p>

<p>I understand that we want to keep things civil, however, we are also creating a huge disincentive to getting those people who know things to share things without sparing their ""reputation"".  This would allow for the posting of questions or answers that should be taken down by moderators anyway, without using reputation dings or downvotes on answers as a mechanism to prevent future ability to participate in comments and answers.  If I consistently answer questions that get novel viewpoints on stackoverflow, who cares that they're wrong?  The argument, as the Greeks used it, often proves more useful than the initially ""wrong"" viewpoint. 
In any case, the downvotes will show people's opinion on anyone else's ""truth"", and the viewer decides which answer has more veracity.  Isn't that the point: surface as many potential answers, rank and stack them by upvotes, while rewarding EVERYONE that was involved, regardless of whether we agree with their answers?</p>

<p>If I answer 100 questions on python, and only one garners an upvote, but that ONE answer unlocked understanding that outweighs the other 99 misses, isn't this BETTER than what we have now?  As it stands, you are tying correctness to political correctness, which I don't care about when I want just the correct part of any answer.</p>

<p>If reputation is just a number, aren't we making a pre-optimization that weeds out avenues we initially think are wrong, but lead to rightness?  And, as a forum, don't we want argument by definition?  Stack exchange has become a place where ad hominem attacks of 'tone policing' are rampant, IMO, and this is BY DESIGN.  But stating this makes people discount the entire truth in my question, and THAT is the problem.  Look past my views, and look at my logic.  </p>

<p>I desire a feature that separates out reputation from the privileges of participation.  I should be able to logically show that an answer is wrong, regardless of whether my ""tone"" is liked.  And that fact is being neglected in the entirety of this supposed ""forum of forums"".  </p>

<p>To put yet another way: As my reputation is too low, I can't even make a feature request and instead have to use my superior logic to backdoor it through the form of a valid question.  This then begs the question: why do you lock feature-requests away from everyone, when everyone can just vote on the best ideas? Not just ideas from people you like?!?  </p>

"312828","Awarding for useful comments","<p>After reading some of answers in Stack Overflow that certainly should not be called answers, I have thought of an idea that comments should probably be awarded more than they are now. How on Earth did I come to this idea? Well, I will try to explain you. </p>

<p>I am a pretty new user in Stack Overflow. Even though I am here for 3.5 years, only not much time ago I started considering myself qualified to answer at least simple PHP questions as I am still a high school student and do not have a lot of experience. But even I have experienced that dilemma: I have 5 minutes, I am sure that I will not be able to write a long and decent answer to the question and I can choose: either I write a comment, which will be helpful and not long, containing the most important information AND get nothing, or I will write a short answer and hope that Stack Overflow veterans will not notice or at least will not down-vote, and the asker will give me some reputation and mark my answer as the best (at least +25 YAY). Have you ever experienced that?</p>

<p>Sometimes I see a short answer and comment under it says: “This should not be an answer.” But it is. And why? Again, because of what I wrote above: people want their work to be accepted, even though it is just a short answer, but it may be extremely useful for the question giver and it still took some time for the person to write it.</p>

<p>I did what Stack Exchange asks to do before asking a question: I did some research. And I noticed that <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296/reputation-for-comments"">there was already a question like mine</a> and I would like to give my solutions to the problems and later answer to some of the counterarguments in that question.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>More intelligent comments reputation system</strong>. (Similar idea was already written by <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/180852/tecbrat"">TecBrat</a> but the comment is probably not that visible as the new question) If reputation for comments could be given, the system like this could be created: comment does not get any reputation until it gets n up-votes. Since nth up-vote, the up-votes will be converted to reputation points. I have noticed that there is a tendency to up-vote the comments which are really useful and provide the asker with required information which could not be explained more in a normal question (again, noticing syntax errors, calculation mistakes, spelling mistakes, etc.) In this case, people who wrote nonsense will certainly not get +75 up-votes on the comments, but the ones who wrote a great idea that is accepted by others will gain a fair amount of reputation points which he/she definitely deserves.</li>
<li><strong>Useful comments</strong>. Okay, let’s say that we leave the reputation just for helpful and informative answers and well-asked and popular questions. But what could we do for people to actually write comments when they are lazy or just do not have enough time for a proper answer? Useful comments section in the user profile could be created. If we look at a profile of a person who has 100 reputation points and “100 very useful (+n up-votes) comments” we can see that the person is really worth something, has a decent knowledge in the subject, he tries and writes the comments not only when he does not know what to write for a good answer, but also when the answer is actually really simple and does not require a long explanation (for example, noticing syntax error in the code).</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that there are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/07/13/reversal-and-pundit-badges/"">badges</a> for writing some useful comments, but in my opinion, it is not a good solution for solving all the problems. When I look to another person’s profile, I do not care about all the badges he got: reputation, profile views, similar information says a lot of about a person: if he/she is interesting to others, if his/her answers are good and important, etc. And if there was additional number which would show information about useful comments, it would also say a lot.</p>

<p>These are ideas for now. I have found many counterarguments for a traditional reputation system used for comments and I partly agree with them. For example, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/197642"">a part of this answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are not supposed to contain answers, in
  any form. If you feel you have an answer to contribute then post it as
  an answer; in which case it will have all the usual voting you
  describe as wanting for a comment. Comments are to ask for
  clarification or point out a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in my opinion, we should not look at what is supposed to be, instead, we should look at <strong>what actually is</strong>. And the truth is that you can find a lot of answers in comments – it just happens, people cannot perfectly control what they write, especially, if they write something they believe is important. If answers are not supposed to be written in comments, what should be written there, then? The only thing that is related to the question, is answer. Or comments on question or answer containing information that would probably improve the question/answer what is <strong>also useful</strong> even though it does not directly answer the question. Using either of the systems I wrote about above, unrelated comments would not give any benefit to the writer, while useful ones would.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I rather like that comments don't affect reputation... It seems to add
  a conversational element without some of the grandstanding that
  conversational answers so often devolve into. Not everything useful to
  the site needs to be tied to rep. – Shog9♦ Jun 28 '09 at 18:14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I can agree with that. Even the speech in comments is usually less formal, people tend to joke in the comments, etc. But not many unrelated comments get up-voted (actually, it is quite rare, at least in “more serious” Stack Exchange pages (for example, StackOverflow) as I noticed). In Meta page I have noticed some people getting easy up-votes for absolutely unimportant messages, but not in Maths page or as I already said, not in StackOverflow. Comments could be evaluated differently here, maybe?</p>

<p>These are my ideas, feel free to say if you disagree with anything, attack me with all possible counterarguments if there are good ones, as maybe these changes would actually damage Stack Exchange? I want all the best for the community, but I am not capable of thinking about everything. I could have also missed a part of important information, maybe an answer to what I wrote here. If so, tell me. Thanks for your attention.</p>

</a> during 2012, it is reasonable to assume it ≥ 6 yo.</p>

<p>A site can be considered successful by satisfying one, or both, of the following conditions: (a) big user-base (b) big profits. I will show that it satisfies neither.</p>

<p><strong>Big user-base?</strong><br>
@ <a href=""https://bountify.co/bounties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://bountify.co/bounties</a> the 1st 66 pg's had 20 posts each, and the 67th pg had 8 so that is 1328 total posts in ≥ 6 years (less than 1 post/day on avg).</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <a href=""https://bountify.co/pZ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">most recent post</a> is 6 days old and the ONLY active bounty!</p>

<p>The user-base is thin and inactive.</p>

<p><strong>Big profits?</strong><br>
I sorted the posts by bounty and gathered the following data (b = bounty):</p>

<p>(0 &lt; pg ≤ 37 → 0 &lt; b ≤ 10,<br>
37 &lt; pg ≤ 44 → 10 ≤ b ≤ 25,<br>
44 &lt; pg ≤ 54 → 25 ≤ b ≤ 50,<br>
54 &lt; pg ≤ 62 → 50 ≤ b ≤ 100,<br>
62 &lt; pg ≤ 67 → b = 100)</p>

<p>Taking into account their <a href=""https://bountify.co/bounties/new"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fee convention</a>, ignoring revenue received from tip fees ($0.99 + $1 per increase in denomination) which is difficult (if not impossible) to estimate, and compensating by making the following change (r = revenue):</p>

<p>(0 &lt; pg ≤ 37 → r = 2.99,<br>
37 &lt; pg ≤ 44 → r = 4.99,<br>
44 &lt; pg ≤ 54 → r = 8.99,<br>
54 &lt; pg ≤ 67 → r = 14.99)</p>

<p>we can get a rough estimate of their all-time revenue:</p>

<p>all-time r = 20*(2.99*37 + 4.99*7 + 8.99*10 + 14.99*12) + 8*14.99*1</p>

<p>→ all-time r = 8426.72</p>

<p>Which is an avg revenue of $3.85 a day.</p>

Maybe there's a way for people to teach them by writing comments without making them feel that way. For example, giving somebody an indefinite question ban might not be worth it because it might make them feel that way even if it's better for the network and instead, after they've been shown to be asking a lot of not very good questions, just get a 21 day question limit and after they ask another question after they get a chance, get a 21 day question limit again and if the question turns out to be good, have the limit end sooner. Also, we can never be sure they aren't going to learn how to ask more good questions than bad questions. Maybe they could also be told that  nobody has an obligation to contribute to the network so it's not that bad to have been made unable to by a block and they didn't do anything wrong but other hard workers did the hard work for them of figuring out how to decide when to block so that they will worry less about making sure they don't write any inaccurate answers because they can get blocked preventing more of them. For me personally, I think it would be better if it worked in such a way that when I'm at my question limit, the probability density of my limit ending remains constant at 1/21 days and I didn't find out when it was going to end until after it ends because that way, I'll see that my experience is all the same to me regardless of how soon my limit is going to end and learn how to enjoy the time before my limit ends and focus on the fact that a goal I previously set of asking another question and seeing if it ends up good has already been done instead of impatiently waiting for it to end and if it's a fixed 21 days and every time I ask a question, I reach my limit, then I will set a new goal of that limit ending and by the time I'm near the end of my life which is probably more than 50 years away, I won't be ready to die before my goal gets done.</p>

<p>For people who are frequently sometimes giving answer with wrong information, maybe they could get an indefinite ban but still have the ability to post a pending answer, and other people could waste less time by marking ones they're not sure are worth keeping as undecided than by blocking them from writing a pending answer in the first place because they insist on doing the research to not reject one that's worthy of keeping, but once in a while, they could review a pending answer of theirs more carefully and approve it if it's worthy of keeping. However for any user, probably very little of any information they ever learned they know for certain is true and it's not worth them write so few answers in the first place because of that. For that reason, researchers themselves should decide it's their job to do their own research and not be so sure that information they read in a Stack Exchange answer or information they got from a web page after Googling is true just because that web page said so when they can't verify another way that it's true.</p>

<p>Also, I find it annoying that I don't get notified when an answer or question I wrote gets deleted. It means me slower to learn whether a question or answer I wrote belongs. Also, if somebody tries to help me learn my writing a comment to a question or answer I wrote and then I don't check Stack Exchange after it gets written and before my question or answer gets deleted, I might miss seeing the comment. If I at least got notified that a question or answer I wrote got deleted, then I could go to the question page and see if a comment was written on it. Also, nobody can teach somebody else a method that tells them how to figure out for certain whether a question or answer is fine to write in a certain way so maybe when somebody tries to teach somebody else by writing a comment, they could be aware that they're just saying what's probably true and not what they know is true and the person they wrote to is free to write back and discuss why they think it might not be true. For me, being given that type of comment is better than being given no comment. Also, they could write a comment and be clear that it is a suggestion and not an order and the person is just meant to do their best so that the other person can make an effort to improve the site by the way they write questions and answer but not feel guilt for not doing a better job of it than they can and instead be like ""Seven"" from the movie ""Gifted"" who got interested in solving the ""Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness"" problem but didn't get stressed over wondering if she couldn't do it.</p>

A side effect of that change was to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/313475/160917"">reduce the size of the clickable area</a>.

"313627","Can VLQ flags on answers raised by >2k rep users count as recommend-deletion votes instead of behaving like regular flags?","<p>I've crossed 2k rep on a site and I frequently use the VLQ review queues there. However, I've noticed that there's no change in the system's behavior when I raise VLQ flags: my flags are simply sent to the review queue, just like it was when I had 1k. I think that this shouldn't happen for answers: 2k rep users can cast recommend-deletion votes (on answers) through the review queue, so their VLQ/NAA flags should behave in a similar manner, in addition to bumping the post to the review queue.</p>

<p>This is how I believe the system should behave: when I raise VLQ and NAA flags on answers, I should get the option to leave one of those 'From review' comments with a link to that entry in the review queue, along with the recommend-deletion vote. The review log for that post should automatically display that I've said 'recommend deletion'.</p>

<p>For questions in the VLQ queue, the status quo is appropriate. With less than 3k rep, I can only raise flags, not close votes, which is appropriate. And I think that 3k rep users can cast their close votes almost everywhere, so that's not a problem.</p>

<p>Is there a particular reason why the present system doesn't seem to run this way? If not, can this be changed?</p>

<p><sub> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/148340/recommend-deletion-vs-flagging"">A post on meta</a> said that recommend-deletion votes by 2k rep users push the posts to a 20k deletion queue.

"314461","Two suggestions to mitigate abusive downvoting","<p>The current functionality of [practically] unlimited downvoting encourages abusive users to engage in conduct that is shady and coward. Although downvotes also decrease voter's reputation score, the truth is that it ultimately allows for unwarranted censorship of anything that does not fit that voter's ego or [capricious] liking. Two suggestions that seem straight-forward to implement may solve this issue.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No user with privilege to vote down should be allowed to issue more than '<em>n</em>' downvotes during a period (for instance, a month or a quarter). The same limit should apply across a site, regardless of users' reputation score in that site. Implementing this suggestion (by adding two columns to user's ""header"" table: one for downvote_count, one for renewal_date) would take care of <em>serial</em> downvoters.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit the number of times user X can downvote user Y during one same period. Implementation of this suggestion will involve creating a new database table with the four following fields: (1) voter (primary key); (2) downvoted user; (3) date/timestamp; and (4) question/answer where downvoting took place.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some (luckily few) users are obsessed about downvoting specific contributors. This happens to me in Law SE, where one self-portrayed attorney shows a recurrent impulse to downvote my answers even though his comments (when it pleases him to make any) turn out to be inaccurate, redundant, or absurd. By now I have accumulated a few screenshots reflecting that decreases of my reputation match [date-wise] equivalent increases of that user's count of downvotes.</p>

<p>Clearly, the purpose of SE voting is to reflect the <em>effort</em> or <em>value</em> of a contributor's posts. It is not aimed at suppressing any and all disagreements with someone else's valid, informed points. Downvoting for the sake of egotistical censorship is an abuse of SE's reputation mechanism.</p>

<p>Here is a list of sites that I think have pretty noticeable flaws because the Code of Conduct banner is pushing the content of the site down, but not the background. I don't have time to explain or screenshot the problem on every single sight on the list (not right now at least, though I'd really appreciate help editing).</p>

<p>I understand that the idea behind the massive redesign is to fix problems like these but a lot of these problems are too severe to wait (in particular, the UX site is practically unusable right now without dismissing the banner because you can't see any of the links to places like ""questions""). </p>

<p>In addition, some of the designs are affected by the increased top bar height, where dismissing the banner doesn't quite fix things completely. I now think this is the cause of <a href=""https://ux.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3234/83293"">another bug that I reported on UX</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Graphic Design is not included on this list because it's a slightly different problem. In any case, I reported it separately <a href=""https://graphicdesign.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3530/79217"">here</a>.</p>

<p>This bug affects a number of other sites that I decided not to list, such as the Cooking site, because it's hardly noticeable there. You could call it a literal ""subtle putdown"" :P</p>

<p>Obviously, we should tag the question with the <code>javascript</code> tag.</p>

<p>It looks redundant, since tags seem to be the best mean to put a context of the question. I believe short, concise and key-wordish titles are more preferrable, so I'd rather make the title like this and let tags say the rest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Check if object is string</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, I noticed that often a question title in Google Search gets automatically prepended with the left-most SO tag text like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>javascript: How to check if an object is a string in JavaScript?</p>

"315690","Don't you think minus rep could cause negative effect?","<p>When you gain something, it means that you will lose it some days. That is indeed. However, there is 2 kinds of losing. Lost something without aware of it and vice versa. And I believe that when we know we've lost something, it will cause a great discouragement for us.</p>

<p>No hard feeling about this, I've joined the Stack for quite few years (I lost my old one, this is my new account). I know how to ask questions, how to answer it, and how to accept the fact of losing rep. But it's not like everyone, such as newbie, could understand this.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is to announce users that they have just lost reputation isn't a good idea. I understand that we should record it for transparent purpose. Imagine what happen when we're announced that we've lost rep because this or that, more or less, disappointed feeling is something hard to avoid. This especially true for newbie, who need a good support and encouragement to join the community.</p>

<p>Generally, Stack communities are built on the good purposes. But keep treating each other 'equally' as machine isn't a good idea. Not at all.</p>

  Bash).</p>
  
  <p>Either way, example in some current answers seem to me a bit

  including details that might be uneeded to explain how the callback
  concept in Bash.</p>

  simpler, more rewarding, and inclduing less Bash-keywords

  will make the attempt to understand the code example even more

Imgur is an online image sharing community and can be see as a complete social network like facebook, tumblr or twitter. Also, you can easily find NSFW content on Imgur...</p>

<p>I am not sure what could be a solution. Proxy, VPN, or else can be strictly forbidden. Two ideas:</p>

<h2>Use another DNS from Imgur</h2>

<p>See with Imgur to use another url. For example, <code>https://i.sstatic.net/VB5JX.png</code> could be <code>http://i.stack.progur.com/VB5JX.png</code> or <code>http://i.stack.imgurpro.com/VB5JX.png</code>. This move the problem to the side of Imgur.</p>

"317614","Maximum size and bandwidth of SE ""voting telegraphy""? Is this a known thing?","<p>Several months ago I was looking at one of my posts, and I noticed an up vote started to toggle. The vote count incremented by one, then decremented again, cyclicly. At my end the rate seemed faster than 2 Hz, and the toggling continued for several seconds. Say 10 full up-down cycles in all, as a short burst.</p>

<p>It felt a bit spooky, as if someone was trying to ""send me a message"" and that's weird because there's never been a case of non-verbal communication in SE ;-)</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is an upper limit to the rate at which someone can indecisively toggle an up vote, or on the total number of toggles, before SE bots say ""that's enough"", or a limit on what people on the other end see? </p>

<p>Because of the way packets route, I assume this can't be easily used to send secret messages without sever corruption because the timing information is lost, at least as far as the viewer sees on the screen.</p>

<ul>
<li>many new users are often technically strong enough to contribute.</li>
<li>new users are often ""forced"" to use an answer as the only way of contributing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe injustice is done to the technically strong and motivated new users.</p>

<p>So a possible solution could be: (Numbers with prepended <code>~</code> are up to optimization and discussion)</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow new users to comment.</li>
<li>Only experienced users (rep > ~<code>1000</code> from answering) can see the comment first, no one else can.</li>
<li><p>Experienced users can upvote, downvote the comment. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If a comment gets a Netto of ~<code>-2</code> the comment could be considered spam
and the <strong>50 rep rule</strong> should be applied to the new user.</p></li>
<li><p>If a comment gets a Netto of ~<code>+2</code> the comment could be considered valuable and becomes visible to the world. The new user can now continue to contribute.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If the new user's comments get accepted ~5 times, his comments can be seen by the world directly. However, they should still be open for voting until <strong>rep 50</strong> is reached.</p></li>
</ul>

"319715","Why are tags related to themselves?","<p>If you click on any tag, it opens up the main page for that tag. One of the options on that page is a link to the ""top users"" of that tag. If you follow that link you get various statistics relating to the top users of that tag. On the side of that page, though, is a list of ""related tags"". For some reason, the top related tag is always the tag itself. E.g. if you are on the ""top users"" page for <a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a> the first tag displayed under ""related tags"" is <a href=""/questions/tagged/feature-request"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feature-request</a>.</p>

<p>This seems a bit odd — the point of ""related tags"" is to show <em>other</em> similar tags, not the very tag that you are already viewing. Can this be fixed so that ""related tags"" only displays actual related tags and not the current tag itself?</p>

<p>Note, It is apparently only under the ""top users"" page the ""synonyms"" page, the ""hot"" page, and the ""new"" page that the tag itself appears as a related tag; on other pages that display related tags, such as the main page of a tag, the tag itself <em>does not</em> appear. </p>

<p>I checked various tags on various sites, and the issue appears to be the same on all of them. Here is a sample screenshot:</p>

I do not yet have 3,000 reputation here so I am unable to vote to close a question. Instead I flagged it with the ""Blatantly off-topic"" reason:</p>

Now, of course, the question is on topic. The question went through the close review queue and unsurprisingly got three votes to be left open. This caused my flag to be declined.</p>

<p>As I understand it, there is some kind of penalty for having a certain number of flags declined. It seems odd that I could possibly get into this situation by flagging a question for a perfectly valid reason which only became invalid due to a change that was made <em>after</em> I flagged it.</p>

"322281","On which site is it easier to earn reputation?","<p>From my experience, it's fairly easy to earn 200 reputation a day on Stack Overflow if you write a few decent answers. Meanwhile, it's incomprehensibly hard to earn 200 rep on Android Enthusiasts a day, even if you write 200 great answers.</p>

<p>I'd like to find out on which site it's easier to earn reputation. For example, comparing reputation leagues across sites could be a good method, but there's no easy way to do so (except writing a program that fetches all leagues and parses them), is it?</p>

<p>FWIW, the highest reputation on a single site is undoubtably Jon Skeet on SO. The second highest appears to have gone to <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/4427"">egreg on TeX - LaTeX</a>.</p>

"322629","Is ""Featured"" the right text for the bounties tab?","<p>On the Home page and Questions page, we have a tab for questions that currently have bounties. The tab reads ""Featured"". I've long wondered why we used ""Featured"" rather than something like... I don't know... ""Bountied"". I asked some of my coworkers and the response I got was </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Someone typed ""Featured"" into a text file 10.5 years ago and it stuck, is my guess. ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I'm not sure we've had bounties - or at least this tab - since the site first launched but that's being a bit pedantic. There may be a more official answer out there somewhere, but I figured I'd see what your thoughts were about changing it. </p>

<p>To be fair, I'm not sure that ""Bounties"" or ""Bountied"" sound particularly great but they do actually say what that tab contains, which ""Featured"" doesn't. On top of that, we use ""Featured on Meta"" to indicate questions that moderators or staff have tagged with the <a href=""/questions/tagged/featured"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;featured&#39;"" rel=""tag"">featured</a> tag, which don't have a bounty associated with them. Using the term in such different ways could be confusing to users.</p>

<p>The thing is, I'd like the option to use ""Featured"" for something else that's more similar to how it's used in relation to Featured Meta posts, which is why I'm asking this question.</p>

<p>Here's what the tabs look like on the Home page of Meta Stack Exchange:</p>

This is useful; it allows us to purge a big pile of comments and then undelete the two that added value.  It also lets us undo accidents (hello, moderating on a phone :-) ).</p>

<p>There is one exception to this: if the author of a comment deleted it, mods can't undelete.  That makes sense; we allow people to take back their words without risk of having them come back later.</p>

<p>I've just bumped into a second exception: I came across a comment that was deleted by a single flag, because the comment contained a magic keyword.  The comment also contained useful information, so I tried to undelete it -- and couldn't.</p>

<p>The author of the comment wanted it there (this wasn't a retraction).  A moderator wanted it there.  But a user who is neither was able to prevent me from recovering the comment.</p>

<p>The regular expression behind this expedited flag-deletion is not perfect.  It can't be; it's only a regex.  Sometimes human judgement is needed.  Not all uses of ""accept"" are bad, and not all occurrences of ""+1"" mean there's not also something valuable in the comment.</p>

"325891","What good is downvoting really? Seems not to serve much useful purpose","<p>I'm not a fan of the downvoting feature in general; frankly, I think it should be removed from all of the stackexchange sites.</p>

<p>Negative feedback leads to negative results. I recognize that the intent is not to provide a means of giving negative feedback, but that's what downvoting does. ""The community's way of telling peers that their content can be improved"" isn't an accurate description of downvoting: people who downvote other people with no explanation as to why (the usual practice) generally consider them not their peers, but their inferiors. </p>

<p>I fear that the downvoting feature panders to the worst aspects of human nature, to an extent that far outweighs any possible benefit that it can provide.
I recognize that the intent of downvoting is to make a form of constructive criticism available, but that it fails to do. It simply says ""this is bad"" without any explanation. If someone really wants to offer constructive criticism, he can do so in the comments, or by closing questions with an explanation of how to bring them up to par. If he does that, it is that that has the value, not a downvote that might or might not go along with it.</p>

<p>I submit that the increasingly negative ""elitist"" reputation of many of the stackexchange sites (stackoverflow, the ""bread and butter"" site, in particular) is due more to unexplained downvotes than anything else: downvoting is (much) more often than not a way of telling new people that they aren't welcome in the club. This isn't conducive to growth.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the recently introduced admonishment to ""be nice"" to new members acknowledges the problem without really doing anything about it. It would be given more teeth if the downvoting feature were removed entirely — people have to give a lot more thought to a comment than a downvote decision. Furthermore, the (apparently many) ""serial downvoters"" who contribute little if anything else to the site would take themselves elsewhere. </p>

<p>Thoughts? What are the positive contributions (are there any?) that downvoting makes to the stackexchange sites?</p>

Then I realized I posted it on the wrong SE network site (I had initially written it for AskUbuntu, but realized it fit better on ServerFault), so I went and deleted it after a few minutes, so I could post it on ServerFault, so I would have to wait before I could post it. I came back this morning, and after all this, the website said I looked like a robot, which is honestly understandable, given my behavior, but I really do need an answer to my question.</p>

<p>The problem is, I can't check the nonexistent box. Other people with the same issue had solved it by going on incognito mode, which didn't work for me. Eventually I figured out that SE is maybe probably using Google CAPTCHA, which just doesn't work in China where I am. I fired up my VPN, but still failed to connect.

<p>Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange have their own chat servers, that are apart from the ""general"" chat server that handles all other sites.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58587/reputation-requirements-compared"">privilege FAQ</a> wasn't clear about this. Also, from what I can tell, my Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange reputation <em>are</em> counting toward my <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/users/78973/gparyani"">general chat reputation</a> (it equals the sum of all my accounts where I have at least 200 reputation, including SO and MSE, taking into account caching). I also remember the moment when that sum total crossed 10,000, and at that moment I was granted the ability to see chat flags. But since the algorithm for calculating Chat.SE reputation changes once a user has the network association bonus rights, it might work differently when a user does not.</p>

<p>When considering whether someone has the requisite 20 rep to chat, does the system on Chat.SE consider reputation on Stack Overflow and Meta Stack Exchange? Ideally I'd prefer it if someone tested this out.</p>

From that time, I’ve been reported as the main contributor to the answer, although the changes I made were pretty small.</p>

<pre><code>community wiki
2 revs, 2 users 56%
Melebius
</code></pre>

<p>I find this devaluing the <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/revisions/169936/1"">original author’s contribution</a>…</p>

<p>The page <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/edit-community-wiki"">Edit community wiki in the Help Center</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>community wiki posts show the editor with the highest percentage of the remaining post in the current version in the author field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/190209/217657"">accepted answer to What does the % in the Community Wiki box mean?</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not the last editor, it's the most prolific editor, based on a very naive calculation involving lines of the post that were changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I am called “the most prolific editor” because I edited <em>something</em> (although a little bit) in all paragraphs? Are the <em>changed lines</em> interpreted as lines of code, ending with the newline character (paragraphs in fact), and not the lines displayed in browser?</p>

<p>One more thing, the page says <code>2 users 56%</code>. Where are the remaining 44%? Only two users have been involved in the <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/169936/revisions"">post’s history</a>, so I’d expect their contribution to be 100%.</p>

"331065","Is it OK to close an on-topic question from a bad user?","<p>Imagine the following scenario. A user gets suspended (fairly) on some site, then creates a new account and asks an on-topic question (the new account asks the question and does nothing else). The IP address, writing style or some other information allow to identify the new account as a sockpuppet beyond reasonable doubt. Is it OK for the moderators to delete or close the on-topic question then, purely because of the past actions of the person who asked it?</p>

<p>Since MSE is not about discussion, I am looking for a generally agreed upon policy. My personal opinion is that it is not OK because Stack Exchange is about content, not about people, and on-topic questions should be welcomed from any source.</p>

"331075","Is the answer “Don't do that” an acceptable response to a “how do I” question?","<p><strong>Hold up!</strong><br>
before you click that button to report this question as a duplicate of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8891/is-dont-do-it-a-valid-answer"">this</a>, consider that not only is that question 10 years old, but is also fairly non-specific, and doesn't make good use of the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">good subjective, bad subjective</a> blog post in the following year.  To fix a 10 year old question and expect new answers is to paint a 10 year old car and expect to sell it for MSRP. </p>

<p>This question is about questions that begin with ""how do"" or ""how does"", meaning questions about methodology and application. It's been a meme in most outside communities that on stack exchange the answer to the question ""How do I do A"" is objectively ""No, don't do A, do B instead"". While this may be helpful in some instances, it's at the least, very condescending.</p>

<p>This means this question is actually two wrapped up in eachother, and very intertwined. The first is, as above, ""Is the answer ""Don't do that"" an acceptable response to a ""how do I"" question?"". The second is then, following the first, ""When can we assume that the person doesn't actually want to know what their question asks?"" The very two are asking two parts of the same scale.</p>

<p>I want to throw one more subject into the ring just to make answers more concise, and cut-throat. Stack exchange isn't know for being particularly ""nice"". Despite the ""Be nice"" policy employed site wide, many users feel that they are rejected for asking questions that may be trivial to others, even if a bit ignorant. The epitome of this, in my opinion, is EE.SE, who usually refuse most (even slightly) ignorant, questions based on <a href=""https://electronics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5846/how-are-newbie-questions-tolerated-here/5848#5848"">arbitrary guides</a>. This has caused a huge riff in the community over the years. Going back to good subjective bad subjective,  the riff appears in the professional elites, which, in a sense are the 'top 1%ers' of the site, controlling a majority of the reputation and the subjective commoners. There have been multiple people who straight up leave because the users there won't abide to said arbitrary standards, and as such the ""don't so that"" is said a lot there. Thus the question I want to throw in is: Does your answer support the ""Be nice"" policy, and will your answer have a positive effect on users if what your answer was the rule?</p>

<p>So let me repeat <strong>my questions</strong>: Is the answer ""Don't do that"" an acceptable response to a ""how do I"" question? When can we assume that the person doesn't actually want to know what their question asks? Does your answer support the ""Be nice"" policy, and will your answer have a positive effect on users if what your answer was the rule?</p>

<p>I encourage all to use examples of ""Don't do it"" answers in your answer.</p>

"331158","Are we aiming for a single answer that covers everything about a question on Stack Exchange?","<p>So I was thinking about why only one answer can be accepted to any particular question on Stack Exchange. I was thinking, most likely, so there would develop one answer that covers ""everything"" about a question which would become ""accepted.""</p>

<p>But this implies repeating a lot of information from existing answers, which can be annoying to users seeking answers to such questions and can generate a lot of downvotes if it's very redundant for the sake of ""completion!"" Plus there's the matter of, if the asker wanted to change the ""accepted"" answer to one recently ""overtaking"" the existing one, the consequent loss of 15 reputation to that answerer, which I really don't like the idea of doing this to in this case.</p>

<p>So should I, in fact, be ""redundant"" to form a singular, coherent, complete answer to a question despite the information being present in other answers already? I do have a preference to only add what I know in addition to what's there, if with a little basic background with the other answers, to questions with existing ""decent"" or better answers. This does make me prefer that either multiple answers could be ""accepted"" or there was some other system of the asker saying ""nice answer"" to more than one answer, without having to choose only one of answers that ultimately cover it which themselves are incomplete!</p>

<p>Though if Stack Exchange really prefers to consolidate ALL essential information into one answer, I can cover the basics on everything and then add my own information in my answers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, two questions (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/331960/332043"">audio ads</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/331951/332043"">jQuery CDN</a>) were migrated here to MSE from MSO. When I went to check in on both of them, my vote was gone, but the score hadn't changed. As in, my vote was preserved, but I can still vote again. It's not associated with my account I guess.</p>

<p>This happened once on an SO migration to MSO - score and vote count remained intact, but I could vote again on the post. Considering child metas have the same UIDs as its attached main site, this isn't a UID issue (so someone who happens to have my SO UID here on MSE doesn't get ownership of my votes on the migrated posts).</p>

<p>Also, if I do vote on the posts, the score does change. There's no update and re-association of votes going on behind the scenes. My second vote acts like a completely separate vote from a different user, not a caching bug. </p>

<p>In case it wasn't clear, steps to reproduce:</p>

<li>Vote on a post</li>
<li>Migration </li>
<li>Vote again </li>

"334440","What does the self-requested reinstatement of two Workplace moderators mean for the community?","<p>After the flurry of moderator resignations and strikes this past week, two resigned moderators have recently asked to be reinstated (<a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/51967323#51967323"">here</a> and <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/51973327#51973327"">here</a>)  and <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6357"">are now active again</a>. </p>

<p>This is frankly concerning.</p>

<p>Firstly, given <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/333968"">the original post by one of the moderators</a> in vehement support of Monica Cellio and decrying the response of Stack Exchange in this situation, this rapid about-face make the sentiments expressed there really rather disingenuous.</p>

<p>Secondly, neither moderator has publicly announced their reinstatement to the community. Instead, <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6360"">one has responded to a post</a> congratulating “the mods” on “placing the needs of The Workplace community first” through an unspecified action, which I can only surmise is asking to be reinstated. This is all the more troubling given these moderators did not openly consult the community before requesting to be reinstated, which demonstrates the same lack of transparency that they had accused Stack Exchange of in its handling of the moderator dismissal situation. </p>

<p>It is difficult to see their actions as putting the community first given that it significantly <strong>undermines</strong> the stance of the ~45 moderators that have resigned or suspended their activities in order to elicit an appropriate response from Stack Exchange regarding the circumstances of Monica Cellio’s dismissal and a Code of Conduct that respects all members.</p>

<p>The silence surrounding this has been deafening, except for <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/q/6362"">this recent question on The Workplace</a>.</p>

<p>On that note, what do these actions by <em>moderators</em>, who are supposed to be representatives of the community, mean for our ""collective bargaining"" for transparency and respect from Stack Exchange?</p>

"334728","Can a fired moderator be elected as a moderator?","<p>While this question is inspired by recent events, it is an independent question and not tied down to any specific moderator or situation.</p>

<p>There's precedent for a moderator who <em>resigned</em> their diamond to simply ask Stack Exchange for their diamond back, without having to stand for reelection. Obviously, this may not apply if the moderator did not resign, but was removed <em>for cause</em> by Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>If a moderator has been ""fired"" by Stack Exchange (has had their diamond removed involuntarily by corporate action), is the person eligible to pull a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marion Barry</a> and regain a diamond through the democratic process on one of our sites, or would any such attempt be blocked? I'm aware that there is a restriction on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/274114/336163"">users who have received a full site suspension in the past year</a> from standing for election, but this is not the same thing as being stripped of a diamond (fired moderators, IME, aren't also given a <em>full site suspension</em> unless their behavior goes beyond ""possibly not a very good moderator"" into ""supervillain"" territory).</p>

<p>If there is no particular rule, what should that rule be?</p>

<ul>
<li>Should fired moderators be immediately eligible to stand for election, subject only to community approval of them returning?</li>
<li>Should fired moderators have to go through a separate re-vetting process with Stack Exchange to regain eligibility to stand for office?</li>
<li>Should fired moderators have an ineligibility window in a similar way that suspended users have one (e.g. after X months or years after being fired, they may stand for election).</li>
<li>Should fired moderators be forever banned from election?</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>no way</em> am I asking about the process for a fired moderator to seek restoration through corporate appeals, etc. I'm asking only about the community election process - if a site's community wants to elect a previously fired moderator, is this inherently objectionable to Stack Exchange?</p>

"335055","Shared Reputation?","<p>Why can't there be (or is there?) a way to gain credence from one's reputation on one site to be able to do something on another (SE vs. SO)?</p>

<p>As someone who has long consumed StackExchange, StackOverflow, SuperUser, but only within the past few years posted questions or answers, I am confused and frustrated by the whole reputation thing.  I understand why reputation exists, but it is frustrating to want to upvote, comment, answer, or whatever, and be told you are not allowed because you don't have sufficient reputation.  If I had some new original questions I needed to ask, then I could gain reputation, but ""the system"" seems to think I am unworthy or clueless to be able to contribute or assess.</p>

<p>Finally I had enough rep (small by most standards) to be able to vote, and maybe even comment(?) on StackOverflow, based on technical questions.  But when I went to Stack Exchange for a question on OS X stuff, I have to start over with 1 rep.  Seems a bit like a slap in the face, particularly since (so far as I know) some questions could appear either place.</p>

<p>Yes, I have ready folks talking about exchanging bounty and how it is more difficult to earn rep on SE than SO, and I don't claim to know all about bounty and the ins and outs of types of rep.  But I do know that I feel as if I have to start over in each meeting place for technical questions, and it is a disincentive (for me) to be involved.</p>

<p>I realize not all (maybe nobody) will agree with my sentiment, but since I only have 1 rep, I guess folks' downvotes won't hurt me, right?</p>

<p>We've had a trolling question which got <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/posts/58336846/revisions"">quite an edit history</a> when the user included their preferred pronouns at the bottom of the question, and I agree that particularly on Stackoverflow (rather than sites like Interpersonal Skills or Workplace), this should be considered as 'noise' since it isn't the strict Q&amp;A this site is about. (The codez should work whatever your gender).</p>

<p>Currently, the suggested way of displaying your pronouns is to put it in your profile's 'About Me' section. However, this is suboptimal, since it requires opening a new page.</p>

<p>I suggest adding a 'preferred pronouns' field in the user profile, and displaying this on a user's usercard. There's currently a 'new contributor' label, so it could be similar to that, with <code>she/her pronouns</code> or whatever they choose.</p>

<p>In comments, it could be appended to the reputation score that currently gets shown when you hover over a name: </p>

<p><code>4,305 reputation, she/her pronouns</code></p>

And an <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336364/286110"">another revision</a> of CoC was introduced. </p>

<p>What I want to know is: </p>

<ul>
<li>has this always been the case that a new revision of a policy was preceded by suppression of the information by limiting access to the earlier revision(s) of the policy?</li>
<li><p>The urge to set things right, or otherwise, might tempt a person (includes legal persons) to suppress the information which is not in that person's interest. However, given that the community has a direct stake in a policy, shouldn't transparency (access to information - necessary for individuals to know the past and to frame convincing arguments in the future if an aforesaid person makes a similar or a more severe mistake) be given priority here? </p>

<p>I can neither find nor can access any reason on the deleted post for its deletion. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that the question was received negatively with votes and most of the addresses to it in the comments and the answers further added to that negative outlook. I also know that some individuals took the criticism as the opportunity 
to  channel their disdain towards certain gender groups (I flagged one on my answer a few hours ago) which probably might have overburdened and also put in a very difficult situation the moderators of this meta. But difficulty in moderation doesn't justify the deletion  of the source. Locking down the post for a certain period could have been adequate for ""reasons of Moderation"". </p>

<p>It can be argued that the deletion would put to rest some of the controversy by restricting access to controversial information so that new or unsuspecting users can focus on what matters to the company (but not necessarily to the community), but given that those who are most vocal on both sides of the spectrum already has consumed the information or has accees to it (10k privilege), how is deletion beneficial to both the community and the company? </p>

<p>Preventing new or unsuspecting users from knowing the mistakes / blunders hardly justifies deletion.  On the contrary, this action could be deemed as a policy to handle a negatively received policy -- damage control to be precise. </p>

<p>So, what good (and for whom) would come out of the aforesaid taken action? </p>

<p>Note: I am not trying to incite anyone to go on a rage towards anyone, including the company. I am aghast by the severity of the action and its possible consequences and trying to seek sense out of it. </p>

"336498","Feedback post: CM review and reinstatement processes","<p>So the next post in the debacle has landed; <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336177/feedback-post-moderator-review-and-reinstatement-processes"">Feedback post: Moderator review and reinstatement processes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I was just wondering, is there going to be a CM Review process coming out at some point?</strong></p>

<p>Hear me out;</p>

<p>Most companies these days have the concept of customer (user) and contractor (moderator), and it's not the 90's anymore, you don't get to treat your customer like king and your contractor like peasant. Contractors will just choose not to work for you if you treat them badly, we can get other work quite easily these days,  more easily than you can get good new contractors.</p>

<p>If, as a company, you find many contractors refusing to work with <em>your</em> staff, you need a review process to find out why.</p>

<p>If you are losing the best contractors because your staff are treating them like dirt on behalf of a customer who doesn't represent the majority of your revenue, then you might need to think about how that might impact your business negatively in the future.</p>

<p>You are essentially just a middle man that connects contractor with customer, and the customer gets the product for free and you give the contractor some imaginary points while you utilise the platform's popularity to advertise services for your own products.</p>

<p>Your moderators <em>are</em> your contractors, and you pay them nothing other than <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44640959"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dopamine points</a>. Your user's are your customers and your customers will probably try to take <a href=""https://www.workflowmax.com/blog/is-your-client-taking-advantage-of-you-12-warning-signs-to-watch-out-for"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">advantage</a> of you more than your contractors.</p>

<p>Your business model seems to be more and more based on treating your customers like king and your contractors like peasants and you are pushing this with a ""progressive"" narrative.</p>

<p>At the moment, the feedback you are getting from your contractors via the medium you have provided them (meta) is largely negative. When are you going to provide a framework for this feedback that you don't just choose to ignore?</p>

"336858","Image Feature Request","<p>I am a moderator for Woodworking SE and question/answer content often requires images. There is a problem loading images to StackExchange sites in that the size of the files must be less than 2 meg. Most photos these days are larger than that and the user must find a way to reduce the file size. This tends to discourage users from including photos and posts often end up including external links to dropbox or other sites rather than adding the photos. I end up chasing these links down and converting the photos myself to provide meaningful content in the posts that will survive over time. I realize that detail is lost in reducing the size, but 2 meg still allows for adequate information for the images I have reduced (using photshop). </p>

<p>It would be very helpful if the image dialog was able to reduce image sizes itself making it easier for people to post. I have seen this ability on other sites from time to time and would like to request this feature in SE.  </p>

<p>However, doing this apparently leaves the network profile unchanged.  This is surprising and unexpected.  It seems like a design flaw.</p>

<p>There are circumstances where a moderator needs to clear a user's profile (e.g., because it is abusive or violates our guidelines).  In those circumstances, we need to clear the user's network profile, too.  Moderators should be given that capability, without needing to contact a community moderator.  I don't see much of a risk or harm.</p>

<p>Also, when we need to clear a user's profile because of abusive content, there is no indication that clearing their profile leaves the network profile untouched, or that we need to contact a CM.  This is a trap for the unwary.</p>

<p>I'd go farther and suggest that in every situation where a moderator changes a user's profile and copies it to all other public sites, it should also change the network profile as well.</p>

Account destruction automatically deleted the comment, as expected (although it left an annoying ""show 1 more comment"" which won't go away), but it <strong>didn't dismiss the flag on the now-deleted comment</strong>, which means I now <em>can't</em> mark the flag helpful without making an unnecessary edit to the comment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have defined a standard process for new policy or process review that includes Community Managers, employees who are long-time community members, and Moderators before being shared and put into place. Our plan is to provide new policies to the planned Moderator Council for feedback periods before they are made official. We will then share it with all Moderators through the Stack Moderators Team for advance notification. We value the deep understanding that moderators on the network have of their communities and users, and welcome honest, respectful feedback from the greater Stack Exchange Community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the complaints that I have heard most frequently in the past few months is that users find out about policy changes only <em>after</em> the discussion and debate have been completed in secret, without them. The above process seems to indicate that this will continue - that moderators are the only ones who will receive advance notice of proposed changes and be allowed the opportunity to provide feedback <em>before</em> a final decision is made.</p>

<p>Let's add a community feedback stage. After feedback has been received from moderators, the proposed change should be posted on Meta or another suitable place for community feedback. To be clear, I'm not asking for the community to be given absolute veto power over a change, but only asking for advance notice <em>and an opportunity to be heard</em> before a final decision is made.</p>

<p>I do not complain about it.</p>

<p>Purpose of this post is to fill the bug.</p>

<p>The problem is that I knew about getting yellow card wrong way.
I became aware of it only when I manually directed browser to review queues page <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/review"">https://stackoverflow.com/review</a> .</p>

<p>StackOverflow usually invites you to participate in review by displaying red dot on review queues icon.
In my case I saw red dot and when I pressed review queues icon I saw message ""There are no review queues available to you"" (without any clickable URLs).
Well, it could be that queue got cleared before I clicked icon or some glitch.</p>

<p>But when I saw it appear again and again with the same message and without any URLs I wondered what could be the case and visited reviews page by directly specifying URL in browser.</p>

<p>Red dot disappeared once I visited review page and saw the warning so it is OK.</p>

<p>The problem is that red dot appears with no actionable URLs or explanation so user has no chances to know that something strange happens.</p>

<p>It would be nice to add some clickable item under message ""There are no review queues available to you"" or make this message clickable so user could see what is going on.</p>

I posted <a href=""https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/978/2"">my answer</a> yesterday, and it was deleted/hidden &amp; locked by Community few hours ago because ""<em>[i]t was flagged as spam or offensive content</em>"".</p>

<p>My answer cannot be considered spam, since it does not advertise any commercial services. Quite the contrary, it discourages the idea of resorting to SE's competitors. The answer contains several links, all of them being Law SE posts on which I support my answer.</p>

<p>The answer does address some users' (including a new Law SE moderator's) unfortunate propensity to downvote and close/VTC posts. Although I did not name the other [non-moderator] user who has that propensity, identifying him is trivial because his pattern of downvoting questions is evident from the multiple links I provided. But that user's pattern is not my answer's fault. For the record, by the time of getting locked &amp; hidden, my answer had gotten two downvotes.</p>

<p>Although my <a href=""https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/posts/978/revisions"">answer</a> might make the alluded users uncomfortable, there is nothing in it that can be reasonably considered ""offensive"", ""rude"", or ""abusive"" so as to get flagged, let alone suppressed. The fact that someone gets uncomfortable by the objectively verifiable arguments in an answer does not imply that the answer is offensive.</p>

<p>In my opinion it would be more helpful to have a single StackExchange site like <em>cryptocurrency.stackexchange.com</em> with different tags for different cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, etc.)</p>

<hr>

<h3>Current state</h3>

<p>Let's take programming languages as an example. When using the same structure as currently used for cryptocurrencies we would have a single stackexchange site for each programming language (e.g. <em>java.stackexchange.com</em>, <em>python.stackexchange.com</em>) but instead we have a single site <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com"">https://stackoverflow.com</a> where all programming questions are asked with different tags for different languages.</p>

<h3>New cryptocurrency/programming language</h3>

<p>For new languages we only need a new tag and users can start asking questions for this specific programming languages. For cryptocurrencies instead you need to wait for a new stackexchange site, which may, for small cryptocurrencies, never appear. If there was a single site for all cryptocurrencies though, you could just ask that questions under a new tag.</p>

<h3>General questions</h3>

<p>And what about questions regarding cryptocurrencies (or programming) in general? On Stackoverflow we can simply ask those questions by not using language- but topic-specific tags. For cryptocurrencies you would <em>?probably?</em> have to post them under <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com"">https://crypto.stackexchange.com</a> using the <code>crypocurreny</code> tag, which is, in my opinion, weird and not good structured, also because there are a lot of different topics regarding cryptocurrencies which currently can't be differentiated because there is only one tag <code>cryptocurreny</code> available.</p>

<p>It seems like this is different from the negative reputation that, technically, has no bearing on badge process. Invalidation seems to imply that the event, and thus it counting in regards to reputation gain is reversed.</p>

<p>So, how exactly do vote reversals interact with reputation calculation with respect to the daily reputation cap?</p>

Now that all schools are closed it is unkown if children are allowed to play outside.

<p>Can this be reversed? If the community wants these kinds of ads which aren't stills, why shouldn't they be able to have it? SE has the final say on if ads can go on rotation, and the fact that they have vetoed ads in the past indicates that they <em>do</em> regularly monitor what community ads are on rotation, so if it's one of increased moderation, at least from my completely uninformed and superficial perspective as a user it doesn't seem like there's any loss there.</p>

They rarely post spam (probably because they get blocked by the system) and if they do post spam content they are sometimes nuked by mods. I am not sure what is the purpose of creating them if the profile pages are rarely seen by anyone unless they post some content. They do contain spam in their profiles quite often, though.</p>

<p>It would not be very difficult to write an automated bot to watch these accounts and catch any content as soon as it is posted.

I am deliberately not providing a link, since I don't want to focus on that instance (the community eventually voted strongly against the proposal and in favor of the staff member's reason; though I believe they were all completely incorrect, I understand they're entitled to their opinion). But I hope you will take my word for it that this was not one of those perpetually suggested poor ideas which everybody comes to Meta to whine about: it was not remotely similar to anything previously suggested (no research or comments suggested that), and it was not a blatant violation of SE philosophy (staff marked it declined because it's supposedly not worth the effort to program into the system).</p>

<p>The staff member did not appear to have consulted other SE employees (his/her response was written within 10 minutes of my proposal, so there wasn't sufficient time for him/her to have thoroughly read my proposal, thought it through, sent it to other employees to ensure at least some consensus, and then written the answer). Are staff members allowed to single-handedly mark stuff that way? What would have happened if other staff members who came by a few minutes later felt that the feature was worth implementing?

<blockquote>
  <p>Every night around 03:00 UTC, a voting fraud detection script is run that looks for patterns such as these. It basically looks for users who have voted on another user's posts many times. The threshold number is fairly low within a given amount of time (the exact mechanics are kept secret). When the system detects this pattern, all of the votes cast from that user to the user affected are reversed, and a ""voting corrected"" event is added to the affected user's reputation history to indicate what has occurred.</p>

Is a post deleted automatically once this threshold has been met? What about the answer that someone tool the time to write?</p>

I made the changes I saw fit, and submitted my suggestion.</p>
<p>To my surprise, my edit was split into two requests. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/20469885"">One was approved</a>, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/20469884"">the other was rejected</a>. I stand by both edits, but I can understand why a reviewer might reject the second; I believe it improved the flow, and it fixed an awkward run-on, but I would not have submitted it alone and I can see why it may have seemed superfluous.</p>
<p>To this day, it stands as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/8166701/joshua-wade?tab=activity&amp;sort=suggestions"">my only rejected edit</a>.</p>

I was following the guidance to <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/303220/8166701"">make edits as complete as possible</a>, and there was no indication that this was <em>two</em> edits, not just one:</p>

"354255","Review badges, we need more of them!","<p>In the past a lot of people have argued to get rid of review badges all together. For example <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/216667/361484"">here</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/187351/abandon-the-review-grind-badges"">here</a>.</p>
<p>To an extent these questions are a bit old, and are based on different mechanics of the review system. But still, there are people that feel we shouldn't have badges for reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing is important</strong><br>
There are a lot of posts, especially on bigger sites that hardly get any attention, and the only viable option of the subpar ones getting closed is the Close Vote review queue. On SO it will never be empty, so essentially we need more reviewers, especially ones as dedicated as <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/401211/congratulations-to-edchum-for-100-000-close-reviews?cb=1"">EdChum</a>. Now ofcourse there is a problem with people doing poor reviews, which was discussed a lot over the past few months, and features to remediate (at least part) of the issue <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/346901/improving-the-review-queues-project-overview"">are being implemented</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Badges</strong><br>
Currently there are 3 review badges to be earned per queue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custodian (bronze) - Complete at least one review task. This badge is awarded once per review type</li>
<li>Reviewer (silver) - Complete at least 250 review tasks...</li>
<li>Steward (gold) - Complete at least 1000 review tasks...</li>
</ul>
<p>So after doing 1000 reviews in a queue the incentive to do more reviews ends. While we could really use more good reviewers.</p>
<p>Hence I propose we <strong>add badges that award more reviews</strong>, with incremental bigger gaps between them in terms of requirements. For example 2500, 5000, 10000 etc. As the current steward badge is already a gold badge these new badges would, of course, also be gold. Unless we are willing to implement something like platinum (which I don't see as very useful).</p>
<p><em>Alternatively</em> we could make the steward badge be awarded for every 1000 reviews completed per review type.</p>

<p>It shows up blue on the post, in the Reputation tab, everywhere else, so making it blue on the profile page would make the user interface better (more consistent?).

<p>This is a particularly pressing problem on more complex questions about inter-language integration and comparison, as the code snippets are not in a single language determined by the tags on the question. What's more, this style of language indication is going to be fairly common precisely because it was the simplest adaptation of the style that was produced by the post-writing support UI: doing a cut-n-paste job to fix up the highlighting used to be a quick job because it was always pasting whole lines.</p>
<p>“Solutions” involving volunteers going through potentially thousands of posts <em>each</em> to find places to fix are non-starters. There's no easy way to search for where the issue might be present, and the amount of effort to apply all the fixes correctly is going to be significant. To my mind at least, it would be easier to reverse the decision to not support the <code>&lt;!-- language: ... --&gt;</code> syntax as that only involves a small number of people having to work and produces things that can be applied across the whole database of posts easily.</p>

<p>Concrete example: <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/490417/1352"">Elasticity of negative binomial regression?</a> on CrossValidated. It was originally closed as unclear, but the OP clarified, so I voted to reopen and followed the question, intending to write an answer when it was reopened. However, it turns out that it was reopened, but although I was following it, I did not get a notification. (The OP posted a comment alerting me to the reopening.)</p>

"355334","Ability to take comment discussions to chat is extremely undiscoverable; please fix","<p>Occasionally when I am trying to figure things out with someone asking a question, I come to the conclusion that it would be better to use the chat. This typically happens well before the stage where the software will automatically prompt (&quot;Comments are not for extended discussion. Would you like to take this discussion to chat?&quot;), and sometimes even a third party will intervene (&quot;could you please take this to chat&quot;) before the software would come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>The problem is, <em>it is an incredible amount of work to actually do so, and even I - as a nearly 10-year veteran - struggled to figure out a way to do it at all</em>.</p>
<p>See, I did the things that are expected of a self-reliant problem solver. After failing to observe anything in the UI directly, I did a web search and managed to find a 9-year-old (!) meta.SE post with comments (!) claiming that there is a <code>&quot;Chat&quot; link at the top of SO and every SE site</code>. That still didn't highlight the next step for me, but it at least offered a hint. Eventually I figured out that that there is a plain text, normal-sized, linked word &quot;chat&quot; (!) between &quot;help&quot; and &quot;log out&quot; (!!) inside the drop-down menu on the far right (!!!).</p>
<p>I want to make it clear here that <em>people can use the Stack Exchange network perfectly well day-in, day-out without ever opening that menu, or even necessarily recognizing it as a menu</em>. So it seems miraculous to me that I was even able to figure out that much, and have no idea how or why I should be expected to know about this obscure &quot;chat&quot; link.</p>
<p>But <strong>even then, it does not solve the problem</strong>. Once I have clicked <code>chat</code> here, I - apparently - have to scroll to the bottom of page 1 of the list of existing chat rooms, find and click a &quot;create a new room&quot; button that is labelled in quite small text, fill out a form to create the room - and <em>then go back to the original post</em> in order to <em>write a comment manually</em> including an invite link.</p>
<p>All of this to reproduce what is single-click functionality - but only when the system arbitrarily decides that it's had enough comment spam.</p>
<p>I am on my hands and knees - please help me to avoid spamming comment sections, because I do not want to spam comment sections. It has been <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107274/take-it-to-chat-before-the-message"">nearly 9 years</a> that people have been asking for this, and now when I search I am sent around in circles of such ancient meta posts (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/96247/is-it-possible-to-import-comments-into-a-chat-room-without-the-link-appearing"">1</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100967/should-move-to-chat-be-provided-on-demand-as-a-button-perhaps"">2</a>). As far as I can tell from those posts, there has never been a non-trivial objection to this feature, just... a lack of action. The last link in particular shows many well-respected community members filing in at various points over the last 9 years to voice support.</p>
<p>I don't understand why the site bothers to offer chat functionality at all if it's going to be this obscure. I have an easier time figuring out Wikipedia governance's internal processes than this.</p>

1 0 1 3 0
1 0 2 3 0

<p>According to Jeff's <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2234236/1595565"">reply on the question about STV file format</a>, the first column is the weight of the vote, and the last column is an end-of-vote record marker, leaving the numbers between the first and last columns indicating which candidate was voted for.</p>
<p>What does the <code>0</code> indicate in the column directly after the &quot;weight&quot; column?  Does that mean the voter did not choose a &quot;1st choice&quot; candidate?  They only chose a 2nd and 3rd choice?  If that is what it means, why are we allowing people to <em>not</em> specify their 1st choice?</p>

"355814","Missing score in Top Users section of a tag","<p>I was looking at the Top Users page on <a href=""https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tags/rambam/topusers"">a particular tag</a> and I saw that it showed that in the past 30 days I had answered two questions for a total score of 3:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Hti4y.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Hti4y.png"" alt=""Screenshot of Top Users page"" /></a></p>
<p>This seemed odd, as I had recently answered a question in this tag that has a score of +7 (i.e. more than the total of all my answers in the past 30 days according to the listing). At first I thought that it might not be counting my most recent answer (i.e. the system might only update every so often and it had not updated since my last answer), and indeed in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/68892/390967"">this answer</a> it is claimed that it gets updated at midnight UTC.</p>
<p>However, if you don't count my most recent answer then I have only one answer within the last 30 days. As you can see in my profile, my previous answer in this tag (prior to the one that is definitely being counted) was back in August, which is well more than 30 days ago:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/fGaN2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/fGaN2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of user profile tag page"" /></a></p>
<p>The Top Users listing must necessarily then be counting my most recent answer, and it is counting it as having a score of +1. I then thought that perhaps if it updated at midnight then it might have only had +1 at midnight with the other upvotes coming on the next day. However, the timeline of the answer shows that all the upvotes came on the same (Stack Exchange) day:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/kvPva.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kvPva.png"" alt=""Screenshot of answer timeline"" /></a></p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the timestamp of the answer you can see that it was posted less than two hours after midnight. I am almost 100% certain that more than one of the upvotes came within the first 22 hours.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that it seems to be only the &quot;Last 30 Days&quot; column that has this issue; the &quot;All Time&quot; column lists my score as 292, which seems to be up to date as that is what it shows in the tag page of my profile:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/aAHp3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aAHp3.png"" alt=""Screenshot of profile tag page"" /></a></p>
<p>So, is there a bug in the calculation of score for Top Users? Or is there some other calculation of the updates that explains how it would have been updated when there was only one upvote on the answer?</p>

He is saying <em>modern</em> disks does not need to check for badblocks, but at least what to do for <em>non-modern</em> disks? Anyway I just want methods to test badblocks not want to debate on opinions. But it appears this user has more reputation and the question get flagged as opinion-based and closed.</p>
<p>So what to do with someone with more reputation trying to mislead my question into an opinion based question? It appears he abused his reputation to express his opinions not really want to provide methods to solve questions.</p>

<p>The thing is that, I don't know if I had a little too much eggnog, but I see the Winter Bash hats double. Especially when executing code on StackOverflow: one hat stays static on the page while the other hat accompanies the profile picture.

<p>I would have expected the hat to be an overlay on top of the profile, but it seems it isn't. There are two (one for the avatar picture and another for the profile card?) and one doesn't move as expected... either that or I had one-too-many cups of eggnog. Funny thing is that it seems to fix itself after a few expand/collapses.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems like a little happy Winter-Bashy bug. It doesn't seem too important and I don't know if it has been reported before (I searched for it, but didn't find it).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What should I have done? If I had also included the terms &quot;diet&quot; and &quot;healthy“ in the search box that would not have improved the results by all that much, and in the post actually containing the term <em>fasting</em> only the term “healthy” is used.</p>

"358630","Meta.*.stackexchange.com sitewise certificate issue","<p>There is a bug where I see a privacy error on all meta.foo.stackexchange.com sites.

<p>Can someone check this out?</p>

<p>As you can see, I got 295 reputation, but when I look at my achievements drop-down in the top right corner, it shows that I only got 291 reputation, as you can see below:</p>

<p>I personally think this is a bit confusing...</p>
<p>I don't think it's meant to be like this, right??..</p>

<p>A user can only get only one hat per site or networkwise?</p>

"358987","Line next to username on profile","<p>My <a href=""https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/users/6953/pacoverflow?tab=profile"">Retrocomputing profile</a> shows a short line next to my username:</p>

<p>I thought it might be like a placeholder for the &quot;top x%&quot; that's next to my profile on other sites where I have more rep, such as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/202205/pacoverflow?tab=profile"">Meta</a>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/oqbeO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/oqbeO.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>But there are other sites where I have low rep and there's no line next to my username, like on <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/users/567783/pacoverflow?tab=profile"">AskUbuntu</a>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/dzjrP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/dzjrP.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>So why does a line appear next to my username on my Retrocomputing profile?</p>
