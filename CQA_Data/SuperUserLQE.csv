I closed the window and continued with what I was doing, not knowing what the thing was about. Not 15 seconds later another window popped up and said something about a virtually signed driver and my pc restarted. I couldn't read all the text because it just closed itself after 2 seconds. My pc just turned on and I need to know what this is. After researching a bit I found a few errors in the Even Viewer that appeared at the time when my pc restarted. Here's what the first one says. ""Event filter with query ""SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA ""Win32_Processor"" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercentage > 99"" could not be reactivated in namespace ""//./root/CIMV2"" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected.""
The second one is a warning and it says: A timeout was reached (30000 milliseconds) while waiting for the syshost32 service to connect. The third one is a warning again: Name resolution for the name miodzaki.bit timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded. The fourth one is an error: A timeout was reached (30000 milliseconds) while waiting for the syshost32 service to connect.
After researching some more stuff I found out that a file named syshost.exe is connected to many errors on my pc, including the one that happened before my pc restarted. It's located in C:\Windows\Installer{F5A90208-4BD4-0D6D-2192 and it has almost no info on who made it and things like that. What do you recommend that I do?

My principal router is also a modem ( Vodafone.de - Kabeldeutschland modem/router )and my second router is from Linksys. Both have wireless capabilities.</p>

One more thing :D my laptop is always connected to the second router and when I connect it to the first one, it doesn't have internet.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post. Just trying to give you as much details as possible.
Thank you in advance</p>

<p>The <strong>first router/modem</strong> gets internet from a coaxial cable. Local ip address is <code>192.168.0.1</code> and subnet mask <code>255.255.255.0</code>. The first router/modem gives ip from <code>192.168.0.2</code> to <code>192.168.0.254</code> An ethernet cable connects an ethernet port of the first modem with the internet port of the second modem ( so I guess its a LAN-WAN connection ).</p>

<p>The <strong>second router</strong> local ip is <code>192.168.1.1</code> and subnet mask <code>255.255.255.0</code> . The second router has DHCP enabled and gives ip from <code>192.168.1.100</code> Now, if someone cares enough to help, I am grateful, if not, please refrain yourself from giving useless comments please </p>

I'm able to boot into Safe Mode w/ Networking, but I can't boot normally even after using <code>msconfig.exe</code> to disable <em>everything</em>. I've tried booting from the last good configuration, but that failed in exactly the same way. I disabled System Restore a long time ago so there are no restore points. I've run Malwarebytes and it didn't find anything. I've had AVG installed since day 1 and haven't had any trouble with viruses since building it. <code>chkdsk /f</code> reports no errors.</p>

<p>I decide to run <code>sfc</code> to fix corrupt system files. However, it fails, saying that there is a system repair pending. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that <code>C:\Windows\winsxs\pending.xml</code> has a lot of content (it looks like a couple hundred lines). I have read elsewhere that interfering with the repair process (e.g. deleting pending.xml) can leave the OS damaged beyond repair, and I wish to avoid reinstalling. </p>

<p>So i have tried <code>&amp;</code>, <code>nohup</code>, <code>emac</code> and so on but those are not what doing what i am looking for or at least i don't know they are working as i am looking for.</p>

<p>I am not trying to login to the server and start some programs or scripts that will be used later or running in the background. I have tried with <code>screen</code> and it's ok for use on server.</p>

<p>But sometimes i have to debug or edit some things on my own pc with <code>sudo</code> access and if i start every program separately i get with 10 terminals opened which i don't need, and with 10 programs this is just too much stuff.</p>

<p>So if i open terminal and login to <code>sudo su</code> is there any way that i open a program like <code>kate</code> for example </p>

<p><code>kate /var/log/mail.log</code></p>

<p>and continue using same terminal again. and opened programs either to close if i close terminal or i can close them manually. Right now every solution that i found from the thread above or on search, doesn't work, some solutions just helps program to keep running when i close terminal, but still terminal is locked and i have to open another one to start another program or open different file.</p>

<p>So for final example how can i:</p>

<p>open terminal</p>

<p>login as <code>sudo su</code></p>

<p>start <code>kate /var/log/mail.log</code></p>

<p>and if i want in same terminal just start another program or open another file </p>

<p>like 'kate /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini`</p>

<p>and get terminal still free to restart postfix </p>

<p>for example <code>service postfix restart</code></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xNzHA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xNzHA.jpg"" alt=""Original data""></a></p>

<p>I decided that i want to make all the values nearer to <code>4300</code> which is in the middle, so i can show the before and after effect of the optimization. Now the sole purpose is for the sake of showing a visual example rather than a mathematical one. But then i decided i should do it numerically using <code>Solver optimization</code> in Microsoft Excel and here how i did it: In <code>column B</code> i assumed that it is <code>=ABS(SUM(B1;-4300))</code> applied to entire <code>Column B</code> and in <code>D2</code> is the total Sum of all values in <code>Column B</code>. Now my optimization problem as a first trial was to Minimize <code>D2</code> to a certain value e.g. <code>15000</code> where Solver will modify values in <code>Column A</code> to reach this objective and where also i would receive new values in <code>Column A</code> that are nearer to <code>4300</code>. </p>

<p>My problem is here: although i succeeded to minimize my data toward a certain value, what i really need to fix is the fact that there are some values ""farther"" than the others, hence they don't ""deserve"" to be as equally closer as the nearer values to <code>4300</code>. We can think about it as a higher penalty factor for far values and a lower penalty for nearer values. How and where should i introduce this penalty factor? </p>

But yesterday I got two new HDD (Seagate Barracuda ST2000DM001 64MB 2TB) home. And when i install them the computer can not find them at all. I have crossed checked the cables with the SSD and all of them seem to work, I also tried to only install one of the disks but that didn't help either. I can't even find them in the bios so I don't really know what to do. When I connect the disks and start the computer both of the disks starts to spin-up for like 2 seconds but then they stop and I cant hear anything from them or feel them vibrate.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea of what can be wrong? If it was only one of the two disks that dident work I would probably blame it on the factory, but since both of them have the exact same issue it feels like I'm missing something.</p>

<p>Ooh yeah, I have a msi h97 gaming 3 motherboard and a 500W power supply from EVGA and the drivers are connected with SATA connectors. Using Windows 10 Education.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Yesterday I tried to update all my drivers for the motherboard to be certain that wasent the problem. And after i re-installed the same On-Board SATA AHCI/RAID Drivers that I already had in installed something relly  wierd happend. 
The disks would show up in Windows under Disk Manager but only as two 38,8GB disks and not 2TB as they shuld. 
When I tried to initialize them i got error message ""The request could not be performed because an I/O device error"". And if I would look at the SATA ports in the BIOS they dident show any disks on the SATA ports. 
So after a couple of houers of searching and trying to initialize them I tried to install the same drivers again. But after I did that I was back to squar one and couldent find them in Windows no more. </p>

<p>Since we've upgraded most people to Office 2016 on Mac and PC, we've seen that the font family in it's entirety wasn't working Office 2016 (we had a really, really old version that was downloaded and kept on our servers for more than a decade, from another source than the one previously mentioned). I found the website previously mentioned, which had an updated font on it. Downloaded it on my Mac, and all seemed to work fine. I did a test document with every single font in the family, installed the same fonts on a Windows 10 computer, and opened it up: The fonts don't look the same! Mac seems to ""fatten"" the font up (or Windows slims it down, whichever one).</p>

<p>And to make sure the font itself is not problematic, I opened two specific fonts (from this family that differ from platform to platform when opened in Word) using Mac's Font Book and Windows' default font viewer in Explorer...and the fonts look exactly the same, at the same size. So it's really a problem with the Office suite not interpreting the fonts properly.</p>

<p>I've taken two screenshots of what the font look like on each OS. Could someone help me figure out why this is happening, and if there is a way to solve it ? Just to make sure we're all on the same page: This is the exact same document (not even a copy), opened on both platforms, at the same time.</p>

<p>I apologize, I am not a windows user (not primarily), but I can find my way around under the hood OK. This has me bewildered. I have a 1-user (me) Win7 Pro install that I used <code>create image</code> (to create a complete image of my drive on an external hard drive -- and created the Recovery CD to boot/reinstall the system on a new drive). It worked fine and everything is working fine -- except for a strange issue regarding the links created to the <code>\Users\All Users</code> and <code>\Users\Default User</code>. They point to a non-existent <code>D:\</code> (it exists -- it is my CD drive, but apparently the external <code>image drive</code>, or possibly the CD, was labeled <code>D:\</code> during the image restore). So now the links point to the wrong place. E.g:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users&gt;dir /a:h
 Volume in drive C is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is ECC4-9A8B

</code></pre>

<p>I generally set the windows explorer view properties to view all system/hidden files (when needed) and to show protected operating system files. So I can take care of tidying up the start menu, etc. as needed. So now when I check the properties of the <code>All Users</code> and <code>Default User</code>, they point to <code>D</code> and are not accessible. Moreover, I cannot edit (or figure out how to edit) the locations to fix the issue.</p>

<p>So my questions are (1) How do I fix the location for the symlinks and junction? and (2) does it really matter? (since Win7 seems happy, but I can foresee it becoming a problem if I ever need to add another user to the system) </p>

<p>Currently I am simply taking care of the start menu through <code>""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu""</code>, which works, but I would like to make things right with the system.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit (SOLVED) - OK, It was Doable</strong></p>

<p>As listed in the comment, and reprinted here to help some other soul who is not windows centric, the basic approach is:</p>

<p>Use <code>Command Prompt</code> (as administrator). Navigate to <code>\Users</code>, then <code>rmdir</code> on both <code>All Users</code> and <code>Default User</code>. </p>

<p>Then create the link and junction:</p>

<pre><code>mklink /D ""All Users"" C:\ProgramData
mklink /J ""Default User"" \Users
</code></pre>

<p>You then recreate the <em>Special Permissions</em> through the <em>Advanced Security Settings</em> dialog for both.</p>

<p>Disable <code>[ ] Include inherited...</code> and choose <code>Add</code> to apply the inherited permissions to the current link/junction). </p>

<p>Under <em>Change Permissions</em> for <code>Everyone</code>  (allow Traverse, List folder, Read attrib, Read extended (all 4 together), and Read permission (toward the bottom)), create (<code>Add</code>) a second <code>Everyone</code> and set (deny list/read), then for <code>SYSTEM</code> grant (all -- individually select allow each), <code>Administrators</code> grant (all -- same) and you are almost done.</p>

<p>You will need to finish up by setting the attributes on the <code>""All Users""</code> link and <code>""Default User""</code> junction as follows:</p>

<pre><code>cd \Users
attrib +H +S +I ""All Users"" /L
attrib +H +S +I ""Default User"" /L
</code></pre>

<p>That will complete the correct restoration of both, which you can confirm:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users&gt;dir /a:h
 Volume in drive C is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is ECC4-9A8B

"1057054","Monitor wifi connection over time","<p>I have very poor WIFI. My speeds range from about 1.9 to 3 Mbps download speed on a good day. Not only that, but my internet cuts out constantly.</p>

<p>My wired Internet has speeds I can't complain about. Averaging 66 Mbps download, and 4 Mbps upload. Which is great, but I can just use wifi for pretty much all of my devices, so that doesn't really do me any good. I haven't been on wired enough to know if it cuts out.</p>

<p>Every time I complain to my ISP, they insist it must be me because I have good wired connection speeds. I'm positive that I am having wifi issues because of their bad service, but is there a way that I can prove this to them? Like a way that I can monitor the connection to them over a prolonged period of time so I can have evidence that the service truly is periodically cutting out and that I have very low internet speeds.</p>

<p>I've ran Internet speed tests at different times every other day for a couple weeks now, documenting the speeds, but of course they find them inaccurate and won't take them into consideration because they're over wifi. (Which is what matters to me)</p>

<p>All day today, starting early this morning (now past 7pm) my wifi has not worked, but yet wired Internet has. I'm too frustrated to call the ISP because I know they'll insist on it being me again. I've tried on multiple devices, a laptop with Windows 10, and 3 different iPhones, and same result on all of them. I'm exhausted of having to constantly reset my modem and router everyday to see if it helps.</p>

<p>I have Charter Internet, and a decently new Netgear R6100 AC1200 Dual Band Router (they wouldn't stop insisting it was my router's fault, so I gave up and bought a new one). I also have a Netgear Universal Wifi Range Extender, 4-port wifi Adapter. This is the exact same router they'll sell you for extra money every month, so I know it really shouldn't be a problem with my router... hopefully. </p>

<p>I do have a large family, so a lot of devices get connected. There's nothing I can really do to change that, however, I don't think I'm still exceeding the amount of devices allowed to my router (it's one that is for many devices).</p>

<p>It's miserable dealing with this. Anything I can do?</p>

"1057404","Excel how to sum all cells with the same name","<p>I have a workbook with 30 or more sheets.  Specifically, each sheet may be an invoice, change order, etc. such that the format of each sheet is not the same as the next one.</p>

<p>The named range <strong>Total</strong> on each sheet may refer to one or more random cells on that sheet.  On the last sheet, I want one cell to show the sum of all cells named <strong>Total</strong>.</p>

<p>The number of sheets may vary.  I do not want to use a pivot table.</p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>:  The formula below will return the total of all cells that belong to any name ""<strong>Total</strong>"" on any of the listed sheets, but I would like to automate it so I don't have to manually add all of the sheet names.  The name <strong>Total</strong> may refer to one cell or any collection of cells on each sheet.  In actual use, the sheet names could be any random name.  So, I'm looking for code that will look at each sheet, and if the sheet contains the name <strong>Total</strong> then it appends <strong>+SUM(sheetname!(Total)</strong> to the equation. The <strong>SUM</strong> function is necessary so that if there are two or more cells per sheet in the named range Total, then they are included in the GrandTotal.
<strong>=SUM(Sheet1!Total)+SUM(Sheet2!Total)+SUM(Sheet3!Total)+SUM(Sheet4!Total)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Another example</strong>:  The following shows why I think it's possible to do what I want in a single step.  <strong>Formulas=GET.CELL(48,INDIRECT(""rc"",0))</strong>  creates a real-time dynamic named range ""Formulas"" that includes every cell in the workbook which contains a formula. You can then conditionally format all cells to have a shaded background when the cell contains a formula.</p>

<p>So, I'm looking for a function something like: <strong>GrandTotal=SUM(GET.CELL(""Total"",INDERECT(""rc"",0))</strong>  where <strong>Total</strong> efers to any cell that belongs to a range named <strong>Total</strong>.</p>

Thankfully I believe I have not seen my laptop crash at all again before today, ever since I updated drivers as described on the linked question. One thing that is probably rather important to note is that I hibernated my laptop for the first time in ages last night, and this BSOD happened perhaps at least an hour after powering it back up this afternoon. As I previously mentioned (at the least maybe in the reddit post my old question links to, not that you should feel obliged to read it) before I started getting this crash very often, without hibernating, I was getting it after ""unhibernating"" quite consistently and that stopped me from hibernating my laptop. </p>

<p>Consequently I feel the cause of this crash is strongly tied to hibernation. :/ TBH I would like to be able to safely hibernate my laptop again so I would be glad if someone could suggest a solution to this issue. Anyhow, without further ado here are some technical details to look through.</p>

<p>So I noticed that like in the previous crash dump(s) the driver nvlddmkm.sys (which is Nvidia right?) is mentioned again. I am 99% sure I have not updated Nvidia driver since the time I switched to newest beta as discussed in comments of my last question..because I don't think a newer version exists yet. The beta version may have transitioned to being stable though because I don't think it's being marked as beta in GeForce Experience anymore.
I don't think I have dumps from the time anymore but, I feel it's worth noting that this seems to be the same kind of crash that happened what was probably close to if not more than a month ago now (post-hibernation crashes that is..I realise now my older question here is only 17 days old atm but whatever idk), before I even swapped to beta Nvidia and Intel drivers. As much as I would like to post more command outputs here like in my previous question, in case they would help more, I really need to go out to meet someone in a few minutes, so I will link my dump file for this latest crash <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4amHnnQLIlvby1zdm8wazE1NU0/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>=MATCH(A1,Table2[[#All],[UPC]],0). 
</code></pre>

<p>All this formula was able to do is give me an error if it doesn't exist and if it did find it it would output the row number. The ultimate end goal is to have to it compare the UPCs scanned into a pre-existing list and if it exist to have it output the row of information next to it in a new cell. </p>

<p>Also can I have this formula return text if it doesn't find the UPC? The final thing is if there is no UPC that is scanned in but the formula is still in place can I make it so it just doesn't output anything not even an error?</p>

"1058573","My Toshiba Laptop won't boot up","<p>So this is a long story, but my laptop that was running Windows 10 crashed about a month ago and when I tried restarting my laptop, it got caught in a boot loop.</p>

<p>To get out of the boot loop, I went into safe mode and tried to type the password, but nothing would happen. My keyboard was fine, so I tried to reset my laptop completely. I wiped the hard drive half way, but then it stopped and said an error occurred to I went to try it again with the F-function and it went halfway again and said an error occurred.</p>

<p>So with the F-function I went into advanced options then I saw an option that said 'Maintain your PC' so I clicked on it and it told me that it would wipe the whole hard drive so I clicked OK then it started. Once it finished my laptop restarted.</p>

<p>When I booted it up the Toshiba logo would pop up but then went black and for 2 seconds some text was in the top left corner and it said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Insert system disk in drive. Press any key when ready....' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then it went back to the Toshiba logo and did the whole thing again. I used the function key <kbd>F10</kbd> and then some more text came saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to enter INTEL(R) setup'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I pressed <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> simultaneously. Then this screen pops up and at the top it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Intel (R) Management Engine BIOS Extension v9.0.0.0025/Intel(R) ME v9.5.30.1808 Copyright(C) 2003-13 Intel Corporation. All Rights Reserved'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>MEBx Login</li>
<li>Intel(R) ME General Settings</li>
<li>Intel(R) AMT Configuration</li>
<li>MEBx Exit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intel(R) ME General Settings and Intel(R) AMT Configuration are not selectable. When I press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on MEBx Login a blue tab pops up and says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Intel(R) ME Password.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know the password is <code>ADMIN</code> so I type that in then a new text pops up and says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Intel(R) ME New Password.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I type in <code>admin</code> again then it says Verify Password so I type in <code>admin</code>. Then it says MEBx Login Error Error applying new password and now every time I boot up my laptop the text with the 'Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>' pops up and I cannot use the function keys anymore.</p>

<li><p>I did a major update of >200 packages on that day, which might have messed things up. Although I'm not quite sure, if the problem appeared right after the update.</p></li>
<li><p>It must have happened very abruptly, since it worked fine a couple of days earlier and then stopped without me doing anything crazy to the cable. Is it likely for the circuitry to break on its own just like that? The computer is about 1-2 years old.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually when the cable is broken one can wiggle and bend it in certain ways to 'fix' the loose contact. Nothing like this works for me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I will test my charger on another computer later today and will post an update with the results as soon as I can. Unfortunately the laptop has since lost all of it's charge and doesn't turn on even when it's plugged in. Also the battery is built in so I cannot easily remove it. 
I tried holding the power button for some time to reset the computer but that didn't do anything. </p>

<p>Is it possible that this might be software-related or should I look into the hardware?</p>

"1060199","Avoiding memory corruption while gaming","<p>So I've gotten myself a lot of BSOD's while gaming in the past, and I'd often google up the errors that came up on my screen and <em>hopefully</em> resolve the issue by a driver update of some sort. </p>

<p>Just recently I was able to ""sense"" a BSOD that was going to happen because my ""System and Compressed Memory"" process on my Task manager was going bonkers, even causing my sound system to make weird sound raps and eventually stop. I quickly decided to end the game that I was playing immediately, and let it calm down. And just to be safe, I did a restart after it calmed down (to avoid anything among the lines of my ram being stuck 'cus that thing was still bonkers) and everything went fine. </p>

<p>Are there any ""rules"" that I should adhere or lookout for when I'm gaming to prevent BSODs' from happening? These bastards come really randomly and it would help if anyone of you could share your experiences and practices. (Aside tuning down graphics of game and those normal things that you see everywhere)</p>

<p>First I experienced that Google Chrome started to randomly freeze sometimes, and when I try to watch a YouTube video in full screen 3 things can happen: it works just fine, it will show the loading screen, won't load, and say something went wrong, or it will show black and green lines and crash the browser.</p>

<p>This happens on Opera too, note that that is running on Chromium core too. On Opera sometimes text disappears, and random cubes on the screen go black (only inside the Opera window).</p>

<p>On Firefox everything works fine, it won't crash, but when I try to watch a YouTube video two things can happen: it will work fine, or it will play the video with lag, which means it will play then for a moment a picture from the video 1 second ago appears and then it will pop back in to the right time, and this happens constantly.</p>

<p>I have no viruses on my computer (hopefully, as I have an antivirus and an antimalware) and I am not running any addons on any of the browsers. I haven't tried it on Internet Explorer, because well - no one uses that, that is very buggy on it's own. All other applications seem to go well, and if I try browsers on virtual machines or other OSes installed on my computer they will work just fine.</p>

<p>My computer is not old, and I have a fast processor, graphics card and 8 GB of ram. I think I might have some problem with Adobe Flash but even after reinstalling it it will still do the same, and on YouTube I am watching videos with the HTML5 player.</p>

<p>Actually this complexity is beyond sufferance for average PowerPivot user.</p>

<p>But how about ""keep it simple"" there?</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have fact table and index table (or many of them) - you can enjoy
them in PowerPinvots using references. Index table there - table with PK.</p></li>
<li><p>But if structure become more  complex, and you need to reference e.g. 
attribute through many to many  tables, then <strong>just include this attribute 
to the fact table and you will not face all those DAX complexities</strong>. 
This could means actually creating another fact table. E.g. if we have difficulties with referencing structures like this <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/F3YwN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/F3YwN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> 
we still are able to create new fact table like this: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XJbOn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XJbOn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>If you become worried about fact table's size - migrate from tabular to<br>
multidimensional model.</p></li>

"1061981","Swapping HDDs on a Mac w/ Snow Leopard","<p><strong>My situation:</strong> I have a ""late '08 aluminum"" MacBook, currently have Snow Leopard installed, along with a multi-boot XP partition via Bootcamp, all on the <strong><em>original</em></strong> hard-drive. The HDD is 7 years old and had its abuse, but I have ""legacy"" applications on both OSes that I cannot transfer.</p>

<p><strong>What I want to do:</strong> I want to swap in a new SSD, and put the old HDD in a drawer. I only want to install only Windows 7 (and eventually 10 &amp; XP) on it. I want the ability to swap in my old HDD to use Snow Leopard/XP without ""difficulty"". For that reason, I'm not going to install Mavericks, Capitan, or Yosemite on my new drive, or anything to jeopardize backwards-compatibility with Snow Leopard from the bootloader. <em>(I've chatted with a few Apple tech's, they have warned that a firmware update will ""bar"" me from using older versions like Snow Leopard, so I'm trying figure out how to work around that.)</em></p>

<p><strong>What I have questions about:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Will the screen pictured below boot to Windows or Linux without ""Macintosh HD"" being present/ever being installed?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FJpj4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FJpj4.jpg"" alt=""Mac bootloader""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Most importantly, if I swapped in my old HDD, will Snow Leopard be accessible and boot, as if nothing happened?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I am also a bit worried about Bootcamp drivers, as well as using NTFS, but I can work through those problems (I think). <em>My current XP installation is NTFS and the only problem with that is not being able to copy files back and forth between partitions.</em></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any expert advice!</p>

I've got various PCs around the house that are from different manufacturers (Acer, Toshiba, and a Custom-built rig), all upgraded to Windows 10.

After that, I started making recovery media for all of my PCs, but I noticed that I've got the option of using either the OEM's recovery media creation software or the windows built-in tool.

<h2>Redundant Backstory:</h2>

<p>Been having sudden, unexpected issues with my External HDD. Went to do some preemptive work, ran HDD Regenerator, it asked me to disable AHCI mode for my drive, which as far as I remember was working just fine, so I did, and as soon as I switched the option in BIOS and reset it, while loading Win7, PC gave a quick BSoD and flashed off only to repeat the cycle every boot.</p>

<p>So I re-enabled AHCI mode and weirdly enough the issue was fixed.</p>

<p>Except for my HDD. It could never be accessed again.</p>

<p>I tried numerous recovery softwares and methods, none of which gave results, or would just hang, until I somehow got WinHex which shows me the entire drive's contents, in seconds, perfectly complete, can browse it from inside the GUI, no issues.</p>

<p>What's also interesting is this all seems to lead back to the iMovie program, which has a series of hidden folders, containing files which are greyed out so I cannot open them.  Yet many of them are names of files of my own, which despite the permissions appearing attributed to me to read and write, I cannot open under my own dock.  Any ideas or suggestions?  It's as though any file I create gets put there, prob through a console directive but then I have no access to it, regardless of what the permissions say?

<p>Ever since I got this new computer, when starting up my computer, System and Compressed Memory (ntoskml.exe) has been using very high <strong>Disk</strong> usage.</p>

<p>I would like to stop this from happening ever again.</p>

<p>A lot of other people have been having the same problem, but it was either high CPU or Memory usage. I have also searched in the SuperUser Website but I can't find a solution</p>

<p>Could you:</p>

<p>1) Explain what ntoskml.exe is</p>

<p>2) Find a solution to this problem</p>

<p>OS: Win 10</p>

<p>Storage: 1TB</p>

<p>RAM: 8GB</p>

<p>Processor: Good enough</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>: A mistake was made, it was ntsk<strong>rnl</strong>.exe not ntsk<strong>ml</strong>.exe I also found out that this happened for only about 10 mins before it went back down</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: I have used the Windows Performance Recorder to record my system.

<p>Purchased a brand new USB Wifi Adapter, installed its driver and has exact same problem error code 31. Obviously it's a Windows 7 issue. Is it possible to repair this without a complete reinstall? </p>

<p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so my friend's desktop PC started up at 3am whilst he was sleeping. He woke up and forced it to shut down during an update not realising the implications this could cause. The following day he started his PC up and windows began repairing itself. However once the computer loaded into Windows he has what appears to be driver issues in <code>Device Manager</code>. This is shown below. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xAQmD.jpg"" alt=""Image Link""></p>

<p>Excuse the German, I don't think it's relevant anyway. We've removed the <code>Realtek RTL8188CE Wireless LAN 802.11N PCI-E NIC</code> driver, restarted the system, and installed the following driver: <code>2007.12.0419.2013_ISS_1.00.0212.L</code>. However, it doesn't matter if this driver is installed using the setup.exe <strong>or</strong> if it's installed via the manual method of locating the driver files. We keep getting the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the
  drivers required for this device. (Code 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suggestions to fix this error code revolve around the re-install of the driver, but we've done this many times ensuring a full system restart each time. Is there something we're missing? </p>

<p>Uninstallation of drivers were done in <code>Device Manager</code>, and as I've mentioned, we've tried re-installing the drivers. The motherboard only identifies itself as <code>LENOVO</code>. Here's the system specs if they're relevant: </p>

<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium m 64-Bit SP1</li>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i7 3770 @ 3.40GHz</li>
<li>RAM: 8 GB Dual-Channel</li>
<li>Motherboard: LENOVO (Bios version E8KT24AUS)</li>
<li>Chipset: Z75</li>
<li>Graphics: 2048MB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7500 Series (MSI)</li>
<li>Realtek RTL8188CE Wireless LAN </li>
<li>Computer Model: </li>
</ul>

<p>Solutions tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethernet cable, still not recognised. </li>
<li>Installation of new driver, error code 31.</li>
<li>System Restore, none available.</li>
<li>Driver roll back, none available. </li>
</ul>

<p>We can't get a direct internet access to update all drivers or windows, so it's becoming a very slow and annoying process. However he does have a laptop he can access the internet with and transfer files to and from his desktop using USB. </p>

<p>Could this possibly be a chipset issue? I find it strange that the USB ports are detected as not having installed properly but these function ok. As this issue only happened after the failed update I'm convinced it's simply a software issue and not hardware related. Any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>

I would like to format the laptop to Windows 10 so I can sell it, but I can't find a way to reinstall Windows 10 without any sort of product key.  Is it possible to format my laptop to Windows 10 without a product key?</p>

<p>This is not related to the <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/946348"">question</a> this is marked a duplicate of because that question is about making a clean install of Windows 10 using the free upgrade.

<p>However, when I go to the <em>nvidia control panel</em> it says I'm still running the old version, and when I go to <em>Programs and Features</em> in the windows control panel, only the old version shows up. But, under <code>C:\NVIDIA\DisplayDriver</code> only the new version shows up. In addition, the installer said the installation was a success, and the screen went black during parts of the installation which I take as a sign that something must have been changed.</p>

<p>So, Is there any way to check which version my computer is really running, or should I just uninstall whatever is there and reinstall?</p>

I can't sync using Google Drive nor can I use any captchas (I click the pictures it tells me to, but when I send my response I get an error message). Incidentally Windows Update isn't working, either (I've been getting the 80072ee2 error), which might be related. I used to not be able to attach files to Gmail or upload to Drive, either, but that fixed itself for some reason.</p>

<p>The problem started back in November 2015. I think it has something to do with me messing around with Windows Features, but I've double-checked those and I can't see what's wrong. Is this a packet issue, or DNS?</p>

<p>EDIT: Decided to poke around with Wireshark (though I am very much uneducated about it) and take a capture while I tried to get Windows Update to go.</p>

<p>It seems that I'm getting a lot of ""TCP ACKed unseen segment"" errors, with my PC as the destination. I think for some reason I'm not able to receive any ACKs from the external server. Lots of FCS errors too.</p>

<p>This might just be an ISP issue as well; we use Telus and apparently they'd switched on IPv6 right around the time I started having problems.</p>

"1076926","What are dangerous motherboard operating temperatures?","<p>There are five motherboard temperature sensors for my PC, according to HW Monitor.</p>

<p>Two of these, called TZ00 and TZ01, are always at 28C and 30C respectively, no matter what. I am inclined to believe that these are bugged readings, since my ambient temp itself is often above 30C.</p>

<p>The other three readings are referred to as TMPIN0, TMPIN1 and TMPIN2. I have no idea what TMPIN0 measures, but TMPIN1 seems to somewhat correlate with my GPU temperature and TMPIN2 definitely matches with the temperature of my CPU.</p>

<p>Under 100% GPU load (with corresponding 85% CPU load), the temperature readings for my PC's motherboard are as follows:</p>

<p>TMPIN0 - 50C  //(Idle = 38C)</p>

<p>TMPIN1 - 64C  //(Idle = 45C)</p>

<p>TMPIN2 - 70C  //(Idle = 43C) </p>

<p>[When CPU is stress tested to 100% load, TMPIN2 reading reaches 74C, with TMPIN1 reading reaching a max of 49C]</p>

<p>I would like to ask very simply, are these still safe (albeit high) operating temperatures when at 100% GPU/CPU load, or are these very dangerous temperatures? </p>

<p>At what point should I be concerned with the temperatures of my motherboard? I have a Dell 0XR1GT motherboard.</p>

<p>Mind, I live on the equator, so I have ambient temps of 29C at night and 34C during the day on average. </p>

<p>Thank you! </p>

<p>Edit: To add, when at 100% GPU load my GPU temperature reading itself is 80C, and under 100% CPU load, my CPU package temperature reading is up to 75C. However, the focus of my question is still on the motherboard temperature reading, since I have found the GPU/CPU readings themselves while high are still acceptable. </p>

I've looked at the Task Manager (see 2nd image) and it does look like it's only using a max of approx 3GB.</p>

<p>There's 2 x 4GB chips installed and I've taken them out one at a time and tested each one on it's own in both slots and it always comes in at 4GB installed (2.98GB usable) when there's only one chip in; and 8GB installed (2.98GB usable) when both chips are in.</p>

<p>This machine is a dual boot with Ububtu so I booted into that and it's recognising the full 8GB (see 3rd image).</p>

<p>I've been trying to find an answer for hours and the one that helps most people (msconfig, boot tab -> advanced options, un-tick memory)(see 4th image) is doing nothing when I reboot.</p>

<p>Anyone any ideas why Windows is not picking up all the memory?</p>

<p>Edit 3: I'm after trying the chips on their own and in each of the two bays. When they're on their own, the hardware reserved is always 1,041MB, no matter the chip or the bay. When combined (in both ways), the hardware reserved RAM is always 5,137MB. This is very annoying. So many similar enough questions out there but none of the solutions are working for me.   </p>

<p>I have a powerful desktop and a laptop and two boys under 15 growing up in our home.

Dynamic IP setting with <strong>Primary DNS 208.67.222.222 and Secondary DNS 208.67.220.220 per OPen DNS instruction</strong>s. Same settings in Network Connections TCP/IPv4 as well. Open DNS set to highest security level and makes no difference at all. Everything comes thru like an open faucet.
Since Open DNS couldn't help, I thought maybe Windows 10 could help but for some strange reason, I don't see a <strong>Family Safety</strong> icon under <em>Control Panel>User Accounts</em>. Spent a lot of time with it and it appears Microsoft is more concerned about getting kids individual emails and sending them their separate ways. </p>

However... <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/27733/Intel-915G-Graphics-and-Memory-Controller"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to intel</a>, the chipset of my computer will support up to 8GB.  So I dug around a little bit more and found <a href=""http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/applnots/30167003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This document from intel</a> that specifies that ""[8000MB] exceeds a 32-bit address limit of 4 GB. In a 32-bit system, only the first 4 GB of memory will be
accessible"".  Apparently, all I have to do is install a 64bit OS.  I am very doubtful of this as my computer has a 32bit Intel Pentium 4.  So, I am wondering if the 8gb of ram will work in my computer without modifications, and if not, what modification would I have to make?</p>

"1080201","Recovering a lost partition table on Windows 8","<p>First of all sorry that I cannot provide additional screenshots and codes (the reason is, why I am here).</p>

<p>I have a Lenovo Thinkpad which is equipped with two storage disks, a 500GB HDD and a 128GB SSD. Yesterday, after I tried to boot the system, the Lenovo logo came up as usual then I saw an unusual blank/black screen for 5-6 seconds and finally a ""Boot option"" menu showed up. I chose the proper boot device (which is the SSD), again the system showed me 5-6 seconds of blank screen and again the ""Boot option"" menu came up.</p>

<p>I used a windows recovery USB and booted the system using that. Using ""diskpart"" I found out that the 500GB HDD is safe and sound but the partition table of 128GB SSD is totally lost. When I tried to run ""list vol"" in ""diskpart"", it replied with ~""No volume/partition exists"".</p>

<p>I tried few other tools, but since there is no partition, none of the normal recovery tools can actually do anything (they need a partition to work on).
Then as the last option I booted the system using ""Active @ boot disk"". It had a tool which is called ""Active@ Partition Recovery"", in this tool I can see both disks, the 500GB HDD has all of its partitions but there is nothing under 128GB SSD (it only shows the name of disk without any partition).</p>

<p>Then I ran the ""Active@ Partition Recovery"" on the 128GB SSD disk, after few hours of processing, the result was thousands of error logs which said ~""Bad sector detected"", ~""cannot read section"".</p>

<p>Then I tried to use CHKDSK to recover the bad sectors, but as I mentioned earlier, CHKDSK did not have the 128GB SSD in its known partitions. Because there is no partition on the disk.</p>

<p>So, now I am totally out of idea, could you help me with any possibility which comes to your mind? I have to recover the data on this partition, it is vital.</p>

<p>Again, sorry that I didn't provide any screenshots to describe the problem better and also sorry if this is a duplicate question. I tried my best to search the forum before submitting this question but unfortunately I couldn't find any answer. There are similar Q but the A was not useful for me.</p>

<p>Thank you all</p>

<p>-UPDATE1-
The last backup is for 72 hours before the crash.</p>

<p>-UPDATE2-
I managed to take some screenshots.</p>

I am trying to setup my Computer B so it can access the internet through Computer A. I have a very basic knowledge about networking and my assumption (after bit of research) is that it can be possible by adding correct static route, but I don't know which IP should be added and on which computer.

<p>Without wasting a moment I bought that laptop as she impressed me more with her persona, her beauty, her talk, her outfits and last but not the least demo of the laptop she shown to me.</p>

<p>Then I come to home and started my laptop. Went to <strong>Control Panel --> System</strong> and got surprised after seeing the below line :</p>

Now I am thinking of an upgrade, and I wonder how do I pick hardware which is compatible with my laptop, and which is good/fast enough? To clarify, I am not asking how to install hardware - that differs perhma41gs6afr8n-tf laptop, and for mine there are plenty of vides already. However, they do not discuss how to pick hardware - and that's what my question is about.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I check which RAM is compatible with my laptop? In CPU-Z I saw that my RAM is 2x8GB, and I'm going to buy 2x16GB. This is a screenshot: it's big an of low quality, so instead of pasting it here, The part number is hma41gs6afr8n-tf, which suggests that it is a Hynix RAM. Now, I can also see that mine is DDR4-2133 (1066MHz), but if I search for Hynix 16GB I see only DDR3 versions, also with 1600MHz. So: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is DDR3 worse than DDR4? Should I proceed looking for DDR4 version?</li>
<li>Do I have to find a RAM with exactly 1066MHz, and what does 2133 mean?</li>
<li>How can I look for compatible RAM of other companies, e.g. Kingston?</li>
<li>Even if I look for Hynix RAM, how can I make sure that it will be the size that fits my laptop? I saw that my laptop RAM modules are quite slim, whereas most that I saw on internet are quite wider.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>My CPU-Z does not show anything about the SSD, as you can see on the link. However, in the Device Manager I could find that its part number is NVMe THNSN5256GPU7 NV. Apparently it is a Toshiba module, however I can't see any other characteristics of it, and neither I have found a lot of info on internet about it. Same questions apply: how can I pick an SSD compatible with my laptop, how do I make sure it is fast enough and it has the right size?</p></li>

"1085803","I'm confused about what a driver exactly is","<p>Alright, so from what I know so far a disk drive is a common type of secondary storage memory. In my book, it says a disk drive stores data by magnetically encoding it onto a circular disk. There are embedded disk drives and external ones that connect through communication ports. Floppy disks are one type of outdated disk drives in favor of USB's which are memory sticks that are recognized by a computer as a disk drive. It then cells optical disks like CD's and DVD's are popular for data storage, and CD and DVD drives read them. So, I'm a bit confused. I was originally under the impression a drive is a disk or USB that stores data so that it can be stored or transported. Now, it's saying CD and DVD drives read information with lasers; that alone confuses me since I'm unsure if optical devices are drives in themselves or just optical drives. It didn't say if there was a difference. When I looked it up, I got a couple different things. One said a drive was a program and one showed a CD and DVD drive as a CD player (which confused me more since I thought a CD player would be considered hardware). I'm also confused about if CD's and DVD's can act as a secondary memory storage (though I'm not sure since I'm not sure if all secondary memory storage has to come in drives and if optical devices are drives). Some in-depth clarification would be great. I'm dying here and the people that do know about computers have somehow managed to confuse me more or weren't sure themselves, haha. </p>

<p>BTW, I'm also confused about what a hard drive is. When I look it up, a CD and DVD player also pops up. It says a hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as Hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves information. Would a disk drive like a floppy disk be considered a hard drive? </p>

"1085898","How to change the fill color of a shape using an excel 2013 button in vba?","<p>I'm trying to develop an excel version of a baseball scorecard with diamonds representing first through third base and a pentagon for home plate.  </p>

<p>Currently I'm working with just the first players batting and base running information in the first inning and will copy the working code to the rest of the other players and in the other innings.  I've placed hidden buttons on top of each base, a button on top of the Out circle, four buttons for balls and three buttons for strikes.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The gist is that when a ball or strike is thrown, the respective button is clicked and the buttons back color will change to <em>dark grey</em>.  If the player is out, the button on top of the out circle is clicked and fills the circle with <em>black</em> color.  For each base the runner makes it to safely, the button is clicked and the base is filled with <em>black</em> color.  When the home plate button is clicked if fills home plate with <em>black</em> color and increases the score in the home score box by one.  Will this work and if so, will someone please help me with the VBA portion of each event?  </p></li>
<li><p>If for any reason, a mistake is made, the respective button can be clicked again and will undo the previous clicks actions.</p></li>
<li><p>The method I will use for testing is clicking each button to see the response and effect.  If the first players buttons work without affecting the other players, I will move on to the next player to see if any previous button is affected by clicking that players buttons. So on and so forth until I reach the last player in the last inning.  I'm assuming that I will not have to test each individual players buttons and that after three or four players working correctly that all players buttons will work correctly.</p></li>

<p>On another page I found the following instructions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holy crap, I got it to work! I'm not a tech guy, but I've been frustrated with this for a year and a half now so I decided to risk it and went to the registry</p>

  <p>and changed all of the following values from 0 to 1(after backing the registry up)</p>
  
  <p>Display1_EnableIndependentRotation
  Display1_IndependentRotation
  Display1_PortraitMode
  Display1_RotationCaps
  Display2_PortraitMode
  Display2_RotationCaps</p>
  
  <p>I don't know if all of these were necessary but it works now.
  The method described there did not work for this computer.</p>

<p>The next reply said this:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>After doing the changes he suggested I was able to see the option for ""Orientation"" on the windows display settings but I wasn't able to save the changes.</p>

<p>But so far as I can tell, the only way to launch the first version of the extension is to set it to ""launch on startup"" (which is unreliable, and interacts weirdly with Chrome crashes), or go Settings>Extensions>Google Hangouts (desktop)>Details>Launch App (from the Chrome Web Store):</p>

<li><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times, ditto for Chrome itself, and I have restarted both the browser and the OS. No joy.  </p></li>

<li><p>adding general-purpose registers</p></li>
<li><p>altering the stack-based calling convention, so that less ""store"" and ""load"" instruction are executed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Theoretically, a 32bit OS may check if it's running on a 64bit processor in order to benefit from those changes, right? Does Windows 10 (32bit) do that? can it be done for 32bit programs on a 64bit Windows?</p>

<p>The abbreviation is used by Cisco for a cable called RJ-21X/CA21A that is used to connect an RJ-21 port on a voice gateway to a patch panel for analog phones. Since there are many other cables such as CA2DA, CA2EA, CA2FA, CA2GA, CA2HA, CA26A, CA27A, I assume that there's a standard.</p>

<p>Anyone can give me any tips on how figure out this problem ?</p>

<p>1) Create a subdomain in my internet domain;</p>

<p>2) Generate a let's encrypt certificat for this subdomain (internet.domain.pem and internet.domain.key);</p>

<p>3) Set the webapp(apache) with this internet.domain.pem and internet.domain.key;</p>

<p>4) Set the intranet dns of internet.domain to intranet webapp server;</p>

<p>The certificates are valid in my docker containers tests, worked like expected. But, I'm not sure if is nothing wrong with using a intranet.domain.com to generate a valid certificate to use in intranet only changing dns intranet. </p>

<p>The use case is for recording video game footage and the space needed is more than any reasonable amount of RAM could handle, and the bandwidth of one drive is too slow. I figure I can store more frames with a faster speed.</p>

<p>EDIT: I would like it to be on top of two drives that are already in use and have data on them. The easiest solution I can think of now is a VM running Windows 7 with a software RAID inside of it, where the two files for the drive are on separate physical drives. Unfortunately that has a lot of overhead.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>IP-Cams: They need an email-address, and I need to store the MAC</li>
<li>VoIP-Phones: Needs MAC, Exten, Phone-Nr., Model-Nr.</li>
<li>Printers, but not having ""\\server\QueueName"" UNC paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>My most pressing problem is are the IP-Cams, they send events via email, and my AD-connected mailserver is not happy, because the email-address cannot be looked up in the AD. But if I create the IP-Cams as ""users"", they will turn up in all sorts of users lists, etc. So none of the object templates fit really well. What's the recommended procedure for this case?</p>

<p>So I think my question boils down to: How do I create custom object type templates for AD in such a way, that the graphical RSAT continue to be able to display/manipulate them?</p>

<p>In case this info is needed: I use ADUC from RSAT@Win7Pro to connect to my AD-forest running on several Samba4 DC machines on Linux. Logon/Mail for human users works well, and normal PCs, so I don't think my AD is faulty.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Contract start= 16/06/2016 means revenue will start in June 2016
Contract end =  23/02/2017 means revenue will end in March 2017

Contract end = 04/02/2017 means revenue will end in Feb 2017

<p>Their hard drive is 1TB (platter-based, not SSD), and they don't have a backup device that large.</p>

<p><strong><em>So here's the plan:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Use Windows 7's integrated Disk Management to reduce the primary partition size to 600GB (the rest is empty space).</li>
<li>Create a <a href=""http://clonezilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Clonezilla</a> live CD.</li>
<li>Use Clonezilla to backup that 600GB partition onto an external USB hard drive.</li>
<li>Switch their system from Windows 7 to Windows 10 using Windows Update.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have run into the first snag: According to Disk Management, their hard drive has 3 partitions.  The first is about 2GB and is listed as ""Active, Recovery Partition"".  That makes sense, as it's likely the recovery partition from the system's manufacturer.  The next partition is about 10GB and is listed just as ""Primary Partition"".  The purpose of this partition is unclear; please see <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1102906/how-to-identify-the-purpose-of-a-partition"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>The final partition is listed as ""Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition"".  This is obviously their Windows 7 partition.</p>

<p>Note that they have never installed any OS on their system except Windows 7, which came pre-installed from the manufacturer.</p>

<p><strong><em>The questions:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Should this plan work?</li>
<li>In order to restore the system, will just having a backup of the last partition using Clonezilla be sufficient, or will there need to be backups of the other partitions as well?</li>

"1103259","font is grainy on new monitors","<p>I purchased two AOC E2470Sw monitors which had decent reviews.  On both of them, the text looks weird.  I noticed it when I plugged it in and compared against my earlier monitors.</p>

<p>I have adjusted the contrast and brightness many times.  I have done this in the monitor menu as well as in Windows.  The difference is subtle but enough that it's all I see when I'm reading.  I held the clear type options a few times but each time it doesn't seem to do anything.  I have two of these monitors and they are both having the same issues.  It's like... there is a haze around the letters.  Sharpness doesn't fix it.  It's like dark, or looks like the letters are not crisp around the background.  I can't show my screen because it would just look like what yours looks like.  I can try to post photographs of the monitors?  The shading just doesn't look right.</p>

<p>Both monitors are using VGA cables.  I have used VGA cables on different monitors and they are fine.  There is a hdmi to vga adapter additionally.</p>

<p>I actually don't know how to describe it.  It's not that it's blurry.  It's that it's crisp but tough to read?  Does that make sense?  Like the letters are stretching?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.</p>

<p>I see this weird echo or alter image when i look at text on this monitor which does not happen on other monitors.</p>

<p>I have some snags for you.</p>

<p>Here is the good monitor. See how the text is clear:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/L450D.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/L450D.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The picture below is from the new monitor.  Look at the base of the I and the n and t and how it's all asymmetrical</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/LOidX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/LOidX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So, I have some text that is half on my previous monitor and half on my new monitor.  When I turn clear type off, they both pretty much look the same.  When I turn it on, it makes it look better on the other monitor, but doesn't do much on the new monitor which is like it's ignoring the fact that I've gone through the options many times.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

"1107795","Remove unnecessary under-the-hood GPG public key cryptography","<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some existing programs, such as <a href=""https://git-annex.branchable.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">git-annex</a> (<a href=""https://git-annex.branchable.com/design/encryption/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">git-annex encryption</a>) and <a href=""https://www.passwordstore.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pass</a>, delegate cryptography to <a href=""https://www.gnupg.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GPG</a>, &quot;a complete and free implementation of the <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenPGP</a> standard&quot;. More specifically, these programs rely on <em>GPG key id-s</em> as a way to interact with GPG:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>GPG is used to create and manage GPG public/private key pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The program is instructed to use a specific GPG public/private key pair via its key id.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While relying on GPG is good and commendable, the specific way in which this is being done (via GPG key id-s) leads to an arguably unnecessary use of public key cryptography under the hood.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Public key/asymmetric cryptography</a> addresses some specific use cases that, broadly speaking, involve the secure transfer of information between one trusted and multiple untrusted parties. If somebody decides to use <code>pass</code> to store their own passwords in a public git repository, there is no untrusted party in this scheme to justify the use of asymmetric cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Traditional/symmetric cryptography</a> is potentially more secure than asymmetric cryptography. E.g., there exist quantum algorithms that break asymmetric cryptography, but there do not exist quantum computers to run them- yet. While such developments are not guaranteed, no similar (potential) weaknesses are known for symmetric cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Asymmetric cryptography benefits from 2 distinct layers of security:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) the private key is symmetrically encrypted with a passphrase</p>
<p>(b) the (encrypted) private key is kept in a secure location</p>
<p>Thus, e.g., (a) adds nothing to the security of asymmetric cryptography as long as (b) holds. It is perfectly valid (though unadvisable) to do asymmetric cryptography with an empty passphrase.</p>
<p>Normal symmetric cryptography, with a single private key, only provides security of type (a). If one were to replace asymmetric with symmetric cryptography, it would be nice to keep both security levels (a) and (b). One way to do that is with 2 symmetric levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>generate private random string</p>
</li>
<li><p>symmetrically encrypt private random string using passphrase, store privately</p>
</li>
<li><p>symmetrically encrypt message with private random string, store publicly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>The following describes what happens under the hood when a program like <code>pass</code> uses GPG via a GPG key id. (Assume public key cryptography is RSA and symmetric cryptography is AES.) First, GPG is used to:</li>
</ol>
<p>(i) create an RSA public/private key pair</p>
<p>(ii) RSA public key is unencrypted, store privately (hard drive) or publicly (key server)</p>
<p>(iii) AES-encrypt RSA private key with passphrase, store privately</p>
<p>Next, following <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880#section-2.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenPGP encryption</a>, this is how encryption works:</p>
<p>(iv) generate random session key</p>
<p>(v) AES-encrypt message with session key, store publicly</p>
<p>(vi) RSA-encrypt session key with RSA public key, store publicly</p>
<p>Observe that the message is compromised by breaking <em>either</em> (v) <em>or</em> (vi).</p>
<p><strong>Unnecessary Potential Vulnerability</strong>:</p>
<p>Suppose that in the future quantum computers are developed, and RSA is broken. (For the paranoid, suppose RSA is already broken.) While this will bring in changes to how we do things like online banking, it will also have a <em>completely unnecessary</em> negative impact on the security of the data created by <code>pass</code>/<code>git-annex</code>.</p>
<p>Just how bad this is depends on whether the RSA public key from (ii) above is stored publicly or privately. If it's stored publicly, the data is already compromised: an attacker can decrypt (vi) obtaining the session key, then decrypt (v) with the session key to get the message. If the RSA public key from (ii) is actually kept private, the security of the data is reduced to (b), the security of the medium holding the RSA public key, which is equivalent to doing asymmetric encryption without a passphrase.</p>
<p>This vulnerability, far fetched or not, is completely unnecessary, as it is due to the unnecessary use of public key cryptography inherent in the existing interface between programs like <code>pass</code>/<code>git-annex</code> and GPG (via GPG key id-s).</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p>Is there a &quot;relatively easy&quot; way to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the use of asymmetric encryption when GPG is used under the hood through GPG key id-s</p>
</li>
<li><p>continue to use GPG to manage keys as before</p>
</li>
<li><p>maintain the 2-level security mentioned in 4 as (a) and (b)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete schematic I'm after is:</p>
<p>(i') generate private random string</p>
<p>(ii') AES-encrypt private random string with passphrase, store privately</p>
<p>(iii') AES-encrypt message with private random string, store publicly</p>
<p>I understand how to do each of these steps separately, but what I'm asking about is the best way to plug such a &quot;fix&quot; in the way programs might use GPG via GPG key id-s. Specifically, I expect such programs to issue external calls of the form <code>gpg --encrypt --recipient &lt;keyid&gt;</code> and <code>gpg --decrypt</code>.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em>: It seems that there is no magic bullet, and intercepting these calls by using a <code>gpg</code> wrapper script is the only way to go. Perhaps GPG should consider this issue in the future.</p>

"1207781","Linux - LVM full disk encryption - Nested volume groups","<p>This question regards creation of custom encrypted full disk setup - that doesn't seem to be (well / at all) documented on the internet.</p>

<p>Basically: idea is to have a full disk (technically partial) encryption setup, with disk split to custom volumes(partitions), protected by single password, without using key files or external boot partition.</p>

<p>Lets start with single fully available hard disk:
Main volume group is created: VG1, spanning over entire disk.
On it 2 logical volumes VG1/LV1 &amp; VG1/LV2.
VG1/LV1 become our ext4 boot partition.
VG1/LV2 become our main encrypted partition -> VG1/LV2_C
Until this moment this is standard single partition setup,
however instead of creating filesystem on it we create physical volume.
On this physical volume we create another volume group: VG1/LV2_C/VG2
Then nested volume group is split further into logical volumes based on custom needs resulting in something along following:</p>

<p>VG1/LV1:/boot  #unencrypted</p>

<p>VG1/LV2_C/VG2/LVA:/partitionA  #encrypted with LV2_C pass</p>

<p>VG1/LV2_C/VG2/LVB:/partitionB  #encrypted with LV2_C pass</p>

<p>VG1/LV2_C/VG2/LVC:/partitionC  #encrypted with LV2_C pass</p>

<p>etc. etc...
(this would seem to also support external /boot partitions, unencrypted volumes (VG1/LV3:), volumes encrypted with separate passwords (VG1/LV4_C:), key files etc.)</p>

<p>My question is - has anyone have any experience with following setup, are there any security/performance/reliability concerns that caused it to be not mentioned anywhere as an option?
Topics that would particularly interest me would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>could VG2 compromise LV2_C security?</p></li>
<li><p>will there be noticeable performance overhead over flat standard encrypted volume?</p></li>
<li><p>can nested volume groups lead to data loss (i.e. by messing up with pointers or alike)?</p></li>
<li><p>is this setup actually what it claims it is (like in case of virtualization) or VG2 is created alongside VG1 and just mapped over its volume's space (this question actually overlap with earlier topics.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a go/stay question as I will be evaluating it on test setup (seem to be working fine now although was behaving slightly weird during creation) - however any inputs would help a lot. Please feel free to let me know what you think. Thanks.</p>

<p>For now with my formulas, I am able to auto shuffle the number for Col M and N based on what I have insert on column A which is 20. This can be change.</p>

<p>What I have problem to have shuffle on the number on M without having duplicate on number that appeared in Col N. </p>

Normally, only one concurrent remote desktop protocol (RDP) session is allowed under Windows 10.  However, I read that one can use Hyper-V to create a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) on the Windows 10 host, and then the two users can simultaneously RDP into each of the two Windows machines: 1) the original host, and 2) the VM.</p>

<p>So, in Hyper-V I created a new Windows 10 VM and an external VM switch.  But I don't know how to use Remote Desktop Connection to remotely access the VM.  Does the VM need its own IP address (separate from that of the host)?  How do I learn or assign that separate IP address?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Problem Solved!  Answer:</strong></p>

<p>It IS as simple as music2myear suggested.  However, because I'm in a tightly buttoned-down University computing environment, network connectivity (and an IP address via our DHCP service) was unavailable until the new VM was properly registered with the University's host database.  After that, oddly, the VM was still unable to connect to the internet until I switched from my external virtual switch to the default switch.  After demonstrating internet connectivity from the VM, I then switched back to the new external virtual switch, which (finally!) allowed me to access the VM via Remote Desktop Connection (after having first allowing remote connections via System/Properties tab/Remote Desktop).  Now two separate users can simultaneously access remotely and use this workstation.</p>

FILEZECOM=`echo $FILE | sed 's/\.f/\.zecomextension64/'`
chmod ugo+x $FILEZECOM
done
</code></pre>

<p>that I want to translate into a batch script.</p>

<p>I came up with :</p>

<pre><code>SET ZECOM = ""C:\path\to\command\dothis.exe""

for %%FILEg in (*g.F) do (
    echo %%~nf
    SET FILE = `echo %%~nFILEg | sed 's/g\./\./' | sed 's/\.F/\.f/'`
    ZECOM -someoption -f %FILE% %%~nFILEg somelib.lib
    SET FILEZECOM=`echo %FILE% | sed 's/\.f/\.zecomextension64/'`
    cacls %FILEZECOM% /g everyone:f
)
</code></pre>

<p>but of course it doesn't work as <code>sed</code> is not a recognized command ... Of course, there's a 32bits gnu version of sed for windows that complains about some dll missing. So what would be my options/alternatives in this situation ?</p>

<p><em>Some background information</em> :</p>

<p>The script looks, in its directory, for all files ending in ""g.F"", and for any such a file <code>totog.F</code> there is also (by construction, at the moment I want to run my script) an homologue file <code>toto.f</code> ; then the script executes the command <code>acommand</code> to which <code>ZECOM</code> points to : <code>ZECOM -someoption -f %FILE% %%~nFILEg somelib.lib</code> that is : <code>acommand -someoption -f toto.f totog.F somelib.lib</code> where <code>someoption</code> is some particular option of the command <code>acommand</code> and where the <code>somelib.lib</code> indicate that the command is to be run while linking to the library file <code>somelib.lib</code>.</p>

<p>This produces a file <code>toto.zecomextension64</code>. (""zecomextension64"" is the extension of the produced files.) Then the <code>cacls</code> gives all rights to everyone, for the produced file. (These produced files will be executed and read by many different users through a same program they will all run in their own session.)</p>

<p>Basilly, I used <code>sed</code> on unix to make the string mappings <code>""totog.F"" --&gt; ""toto.f""</code> and <code>""toto.f"" --&gt; ""toto.zecomextension64""</code>.</p>

"1344627","Memory stick is showing 4GB but is actually only giving 2GB. Why?","<p>I have a gigabyte 880 GA-ud3h rev 2.2 motherboard which I know supports up to 16 GB of ram, installed with it is a 64-bit Windows 7. On this mother board there are 4 slots for memory, on the first 3 slots I installed a corsair xms3 4gb (2x2gb) memory stick and on the last ram a different brand of stick but only has 2gb, other than the brand and size difference, all the other aspects of the 4 sticks are the same, like frequency and stuff like that. </p>

<p>All in all, I should be running with 14gb of memory.</p>

<p>What is puzzling me is why the first 3 sticks are only giving me 2gb each, which is weird because on the surface of the sticks there are stickers and that's where all the information are printed and it's clearly printed there ""Corsair XMS3 4GB (2x2GB). But when I checked using EasyTune 6, CPU z and PC Wizard, it says all 3 only amounts to only 6gb combined and 8gb in total if you include the 4th stick..</p>

<p>And I'm not talking about ""usable"" memory, I'm talking about this.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/PBnfD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PBnfD.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Slots 1 to 3 show the same ""2048"" mb report.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/tnad8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/tnad8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I'm really starting to think that I've been scammed. But I want to acknowledge all the possible alternatives before concluding this.</p>

<p>Are there any other ways that a supposed ""4 gb"" stick will only give 2gb? I've already updated the BiOS but no luck. Does 4gb (2x2gb) actually mean only 2gb? </p>

<p>And this is not just happening with one stick, all 3 corsair sticks are only giving me 2gb.</p>

<p>At this point, what should I do? </p>

<p>Of course in the end I could just go to the merchant and have my products refunded, but I don't want to end up buying a different stick of the same size but still only receiving 2gb because in the end there was a problem after all with my computer and how it handles memory and it would just be a massive time waster in the end. </p>

<p>So, in conclusion, any ideas?</p>

<p>I am able to SSH into it, use Samba for my NAS, and even have each of my computers using TS3 and Minecraft together successfully; all on the LAN. My goal is to allow the Minecraft and TS3 ports to be accessible outside my LAN.</p>

<p>I have my ISP modem forwarding the ports to my subnet's router and that router forwarding to the server. Great. Minecraft and TS3 works and is accessible <strong>within</strong> the LAN regardless if the VPN is UP or DOWN.</p>

<p>I'd like to leave the VPN up, but exclude the Minecraft and TS3 from the VPNs route.</p>

<p>How do I configure the routes?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I'd like for the outside clients (unknown OS) to connect to the MC &amp; TS servers that are being hosted on an inside Ubuntu Server 16.04.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Server is hosting MC, TS, Samba services, Plex, uTorrent and SickRage. OpenVPN is running on here as well.</p>

<p>My ISP router is unmodified and my subnet router is an unmodified ASUS. I did open and forward the appropriate ports, daisy-chained, to the Ubuntu Server.</p>

<p>My internal clients consist of a mix of OS X, Windows 10, and various Android versions. Each of the internal clients are able to access the Ubuntu services listed above using the server's internally assigned IP.</p>

<p>In addition, the iptables on the Ubuntu Server are completely open, which once I figure out how to get the MC &amp; TS working, I can add additional restrictions.</p>

<pre><code>sudo iptables -S
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>
I just went through my routers and verified the port forwarding and firewall exceptions. Everythings square. At the CLI, I ran <code>sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn stop</code> and visited <a href=""http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a>. </p>

<p>The returned results: <code>Port 10011 is open on 97.*.*.*</code></p>

"1113736","Windows 10 installation stuck at purple screen","<p>A couple of days ago after updating Windows 10 (not upgrading to but updating) I mistakenly clicked on restart instead of shutdown so it restarted normally after which I shut it down. But the next afternoon when I started my PC it fails to boot and shows a black screen with a blinking underscore symbol. Like the one we see in command prompt or turbo C. After encountering this, I tried to reboot, pressing the f8 key, checking the cables and a lot but nothing hardware related seemed at fault. </p>

<p>After what would be like the 15th failed attempt I got an ISO file of Windows 10 x64 and attempted to install it at which it gets stuck at the purple screen and again to text or such display. However there momentarily appears a command prompt window on the screen which is fast so I can't read or catch it in my camera. However the install remains such at the purple screen. Any help to get my computer back and running would be great. </p>

<p>Edit: Aside from checking the PC, cables etc. I also have downloaded the ISO not twice but thrice and it doesn't seem to work with any of them. Also I am using my old faithful flash drive which I have used since a lot of time so it is definitely not the problem</p>

"1510832","Can a new motherboard be damaged because of slight electrostatic discharge from my hair?","<p>I know there are a lot of posts and questions regarding electrostatic discharge (ESD) when building a PC but couldn’t find a specific answer for the case I’m encountering.</p>

<p>Today I built a new PC(my first), had bought a strap to keep grounded all was good,</p>

<p>Until I had to lift the board and get my eyes close to it (to inspect a standoff screw) at which point I heard a very soft clicking noise.</p>

<p>It was my hair that came in contact with the back (underside) of the motherboard.</p>

<p>Now to be clear I don’t have abnormally long hair, and am not prone to frequent zaps, but it is dry cold winter so…</p>

<p>Couldn’t tell if there was an electric discharge or simply a single hair that got hooked to one of the soldering and snapped when i backed away.</p>

<p>My understanding was that the strap would keep all ESD safe, but after some light testing  with an old small liquid crystal display i realized that whatever static i had in my hair was independent from rest of body and not discharged.</p>

<p>I have not had a chance yet to test the build as it’s missing some components (mainly PSU). So unclear if it is damaged.</p>

<p>At the time of “noise” the only components installed were NVMe SSD and CPU (with cooler). So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What components are prone to damage by ESD ? Is a CPU vulnerable remotely (meaning via the board getting shocked?)</li>
<li>Should I be worried for the board? The motherboard in question is an from Asus X570.</li>
<li>In your opinion would I be worth attempting to replace with a new?</li>
<li>Do modern boards have ESD protection all around of is that a myth?</li>
<li>And ultimately how to mitigate this risk aside from wearing a full hair cover?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading and offering some insight, this might seem like a lot for so little; but when you spend large amount of money and decide to do it yourself, can’t help but freak over what you could have wrong.</p>

<p>Background, I needed to upgrade my 128 GB SSD C:\ drive to 275 GB as I was down to only 10 MB of storage. I have a Mirrored 1TB drive using 2 x 1 TB 7200 RPM SATA hard drives. I also had a striped array using 3 more 128 GB SSDs that I used as temporary video streaming to my HDTV through iTunes down to iTV box as the SSD performance improvement was very noticeable compared to coming from the 1 TB mirrored drives. </p>

<p>Crucial drives now come with a onetime Acronis clone option that really makes this upgrade process easy. For safety reasons, I powered off the striped drives, connected the new 275 GB drive and ran the Acronis utility targeting the new 275 GB drive with my existing C:\ SSD 128 GB drive. The machine restarts and then this program runs without interaction nor any viewable feedback on screen. However, when it finishes, the machine shuts down and you can then swap out the old drive with the new one and sure enough, the machine boots up perfectly and you now have everything as it was but with all that extra storage, no other configuration needed. Well, except for the mirrored drives and the striped set once I reconnected those. But this part was anything but easy. </p>

<p>And here’s where I got a little scared and hope to help anyone in a similar position. The 1 TB mirror had all my personal data, but those were coming up in Windows 7 Disk Management as offline. I tried to reactivate them, but no luck. I had broken the mirror on the past and recreated it that way successfully, so I thought I’d go that route. This then caused both 1 TB disks to show up as foreign and offline. I was scared now. Also, the Import Foreign Disks option was greyed out, so what to do now?</p>

and this <a href=""https://www.takealot.com/tp-link-300mbps-wireless-range-extender/PLID32580079"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">range extender</a> in the middle of the house because the router's signal won't reach my room.
The problem is, on occasions the range extender seems to disconnect from the router, and the only solution is to restart the extender, but it doesn't affect the router.</p>

<p>The Wi-Fi from the extender is still there, but it can't connect to the Internet. This is so frustrating! Imagine trying to watch a movie on Netflix but having to go to restart the range extender within half an hour or so because the Wi-Fi is down!</p>

<p>Did this happen to anyone before? 
Do you think is the router's problem or the range extender?</p>

Let's say you have a bunch of files of varying size and need to put them on discs to back them up. These files do not need any directories preserved and do not need to be stored in any particular order. The end goal is just to leave the smallest amount of free space per disc. I do not want to use a compression program like 7zip to split an archive across the discs because if one disc is lost/damaged then all the data is unreadable. This is a question simply to learn HOW you would do this, I am aware storage is cheap and that this process could be time consuming. I'm just curious and want to learn how this would be done. As a very basic example look below;  </p>

<p>I want to store these six files totaling 89MiB on two 50MiB discs. <strong>This is a very basic example.</strong> Increasing the number of files and having more random sizes is what seems to make this impossible, from a mental equation standpoint at least.<br>

B.7z - 20MiB<br>
C.7z - 30MiB<br>
D.7z - 10MiB<br>
E.7z - 07MiB<br>
F.7z - 12MiB<br>
If I went by ABC order these files would need a third disc. However if file B and C go together on the first and A, D, E, and F go on the second it only takes two discs.</p>

"1215884","Windows 10 Pro networking: allowing users to remotely access accounting software on a laptop; security and conceptual questions before testing","<p>I had posted two questions about the situation described in the heading last month.  Thought they were eventually marked as ""too broad,"" closed, and deleted, the preliminary comments were tremendously helpful in solving what was a rather intricate problem.  (In fact, so were all the promising search results).  For the sake of posterity, I wanted to post my question again (hopefully using more of the canonical language, so as not to violate the community standard for specificity) along with both the solutions that I found.</p>

<p>The situation:  users in two different cities running windows 10 pro laptops behind standard residential high speed internet/router setups need ready access to an accounting database application currently installed on one of the computers.</p>

<p>The constraints:  solutions cannot require any new hardware or the purchase of any new software; furthermore, because I will be administrating whatever system is put in place, it needs to be simple enough to be maintained by someone whose background in networking is limited to a careful reading of the ""all-in-one for dummies"" on the subject.</p>

<p>Question:  since, if the laptops were on a local network together, simply mapping a shared drive from the laptop running the accounting application to the other would allow for concurrent access (the ideal situation) to the accounting system, which natively supports multiple users, establishing a VPN, which will simulate such a LAN connection, then mapping a drive as usual, seems like a good first attempt.  Since financial data will be transmitted, security is a principal concern:  before I attempt to test anything, which will involve forwarding ports on one of the routers hence an obvious security risk, what do I need to know about choosing, installing, and testing VPN software ahead of time to prevent undue exposure while learning-by-doing?</p>

<p>EDIT.</p>

<p>Another question:  assume I have established a VPN connection and mapped a drive, but that the accounting application runs too slow if accessed concurrently; since the application is just a database and is designed for installation on a server, I suspect that the problem is that it has been installed on a few year old windows 10 pro laptop.  There is nothing I can do about the hardware or operating system on that machine, so I need a ""faster"" way to connect safely.  Although originally meant for network administration tasks, RDP seems like a possible solution, since it works natively with the operating systems and has a mechanism to prevent concurrent access to the system.  So, I ask the analogous question to the above, but about RDP instead of VPN:  what do I need to know to safely get started with testing?</p>

"1216118","How can I determine if a network switch has sufficient bandwidth to support PC to PC transfers at the same time as internet access?","<p>I have a problem with a switch that will allow high traffic between two PCs yet this transfer interferes​ with a third that wants to get through the switch to a router  and on to the internet. As a result I need a switch that knows to route traffic to specific ports instead of broadcasting all traffic to all ports.</p>

<p>All 3 PCs are on the same subnet. </p>

<p>Imagine that I want to keep Netflix flowing even if two other computers on the same subnet are transferring files between their windows shares.</p>

<p>Originally I bought a <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B006C2DV5G"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cisco/Linksys SE1500 ""switch""</a>
 on Amazon and found that the traffic from the two PCs was blocking all the other ports.</p>

<p>Back when I used to buy switches they kept a MAC address table in memory and switched traffic to where it should go.  </p>

<p>Maybe the problem has to do with the capacity of the backplane of the cheap switch that was causing the blocking.  I don't really understand how to shop for what I want in this price range.  </p>

<p>How can I determine whether a switch I am looking at online will have the capacity I need?</p>

To give an example, I can run CMD as administrator just fine. However if I try to view a network device's properties, which require admin privileges, I get the following error:</p>

<p>I have a Windows 10 machine with my VirtualBox which is my development environment. My hardware that I can do backups on is a secondary internal drive that is the same size as the main drive and a 2TB external drive from Seagate. I need a 100% way of doing a backup so I don’t lose my stuff again. I would like to have at least two backups at all times - full image, bootable in case the entire OS goes down. </p>

<p>Questions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I configure Windows 10 backup tools to do a backup of the entire hard drive, alternating between the drive - one internal and one external. I could put more hard drives in if needed as well but to simplify I wanted to see if this can be done.</p></li>
<li><p>If the above can’t be done what do you recommend? And preferably the steps on whatever software you are recommending. I have looked for various software to do this and tested many of them and each failed at some crucial part.</p></li>
<li><p>Will Windows image the disk and will it be bootable or is that what the system repair disk is used for? Maybe explain the process of hard drive goes down completely - how do I get the image file that is on one of the drives back on the C Drive?</p></li>
<li><p>Will a system image take care of the VirtualBox program and all the machines? I think it will but not sure.</p></li>

<li>Try different versions of <em>pestudio</em></li>
<li>Try <em>pestudio</em> upload from a second PC</li>

"1120819","Looking to convert my bat file to Powershell","<p>I have the 2  batch files below that I want to convert into Powershell.</p>

<p>I have bat1.bat associated with a file extension so when I double click on that extension bat1.bat is executed and the first parameter is the filename that was double clicked</p>

<p>Why use 2 bat files?  Well if I just use bat2 I get a command window open and visible until the final program is exited. By using the 2 batch files above I only get a taskbar icon (which I want to get rid of).  Which brings me to why I want to convert to Powershell.  I want to be able to double click on one of the files and have PS open the Access program and have no icon or any visual indication at all.

"1120989","Disable BIOS after POST, from OS","<p>I don't really know if this is the right website to post this question, but here it goes (TL;DR highlighted):</p>

<p>It actually starts with a funny story which is needed for me to tell in case there are any misunderstandings. A good friend of mine met somebody in an online game, and that somebody managed to infect him with some kind of custom-coded virus. My friend called me for help, and when I arrived I discovered that he was being controlled remotely from the attacker's computer, who had full control over my friend's network.</p>

<p>Anyway, after being able to control the computer and whatnot, he uploaded many programs (most likely written by him) and he had the ability to hear what was going on in the room (through my friend's phone, but that's another story). He also started sending messages to my friend's Skype. When I mentioned <em>BIOS</em>, he had sent a message saying that he disabled it and there's no way of me getting back into it.</p>

<hr>

<p>So I tried, turned off the PC, turned it on and <strong><em>started spamming F2, F10, F12, Delete, Tab, and many other buttons which I have knowledge of that could open up the BIOS. It did not show up, then I started the computer again, and it booted into Windows after a few seconds of black screen</em></strong>. I had to stop the computer, <strong><em>reset the CMOS and then I actually managed to get into the BIOS</em></strong>, but <strong><em>after booting into Windows AGAIN, the BIOS went missing AGAIN</em></strong>, which led me to believe he placed an executable file in the Startup folder, or made it run whenever Windows got booted up—I was not connected to the Internet (or to the network, in fact) since the point when I discovered the BIOS was not working.</p>

<hr>

<h2>ACTUAL QUESTION:</h2>

<p><strong>Now, I was very surprised that this is possible, and if I were you I would not believe it myself if I were to read it in a random question on the Internet. But I really have to ask somebody, <em>how is disabing the BIOS from the Operating System possible? Or if not specific enough, how is it possible to disable the BIOS after POST?</em></strong></p>

<h2>EDIT NOTES:</h2>

<p>I tried highlighting the important parts for a TL;DR. As I said, I would not blame you for not believing this, and I really hope this question will not get closed for an improper format.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure ""true"" regular expressions can't do this, since it involves an unknown number of capture groups which have to be left intact, so I expect a solution will make use of some other capability of Notepad++.

<p>My broadband provider, Vodafone, gives my the ability to 'boost' one device at a time - for example, if I want to stream a movie on one device, I can boost it so that it receives a better connection.</p>

<p>I usually have a bit of trouble connecting my phone to the wireless network via the Vodafone Connect router, and I find that using the 'boost' feature normally helps.</p>

<p>The mobile app used to do the boosting is a bit annoying to use, and I'd also like to be able to automate the process, so I'm trying to work out which network packets I need to send to the router in order to boost one of my devices.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can only boost devices through the app on my phone (and not through the web interface on my computer), so it's more difficult than I'd like to sniff the network traffic between the two and filter out exactly those signals that are used for the boosting. </p>

<p>I've tried setting up a Man in the Middle attack between my phone and my router on my computer (running Arch Linux 4.19 LTS), but I'm not convinced that I'm picking up the packets that are to do with boosting the device.</p>

<p>Obviously, most of the signals between the phone and the router are related to the phone accessing the internet, rather than direct contact between the two, but I'm not sure if it's possible to filter these out without also filtering out the packets I'm interested in.</p>

<p>I ran CHKDSK C: /r and it did report about 4KB in bad sectors. </p>

<p>Then I tried to use <em>Clonezilla</em> (from CD). In the beginner's mode it failed too, and when I used -rescue option it reported about bad sectors and then slowed down dramatically (estimated time grew from 30 min to 2 hours and kept counting), so I aborted the process.</p>

<p>What is the best thing I can do now? Shall I leave Clonezilla to run for as long as it needs or is there a better way?</p>

"1122474","Is this an accurate summary of the Windows Registry?","<p>I'm reading the book ""Learning Python, 5th Edition"" by Mark Lutz and the author makes a comment about the Windows Registry that got me wondering.</p>

<p>Here is the sentence in question (from Chapter 3, Section 2):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because newer Windows systems use the Windows      Registry (a.k.a. filename associations) to find a program with which to      run a file, you don’t need to name “python” or “py” on the command line      explicitly to run a <em>.py</em> file.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Is this a <em>complete</em> description of the Windows Registry?</li>
</ol>

<p>(I'm 99% certain it is not, as it wasn't the main intent of the author to describe the Windows Registry.)</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Is it an <em>accurate</em> description of the Windows Registry?</li>
</ol>

<p>Put another way, <em>are</em> all Windows filename associations in fact stored in the Windows Registry, or are there multiple other places such associations may be stored?</p>

<p>(If it is not accurate, how should this sentence be worded to be <em>entirely</em> accurate, without broadening the scope beyond the author's intent?)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(a) When playing, starting a video or audio file or a stream (youtube for example) the audio starts 4 seconds late (no sync issues, just no sound for the first few seconds)</p></li>
<li><p>(b) When switching video or audio source fast, volume goes up to 100% (when audio source starts for 2-3 seconds and then starts from other source, youtube playlist next video, while playing video in vlc, opening another file from folder, video stops for some time, next one plays)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My trial &amp; error &amp; some you should knows and let's divide the problems to a &amp; b.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I can be somewhat considered as a poweruser (talk tech, no need to translate to ""normal"" language)</p></li>
<li><p>I have not been able to solve it in any way. I think it is because the audio board or something there is shutting down to save power. I am looking for an option for keeping it on always or some somewhat easy to reach switch (software) to manually make it always on mode. (this is the solve from a)</p></li>
<li><p>I was able to download and install a generic driver directly from Realtek's website and install it. But there occurred serval problems: The headphones or external speakers didn't work. In Realtek's software what came with the driver it detected it, but in windows playback devices it showed it was playing sound, but nothing came out. If in Realtek software I selected to separate the sound outputs then the sound came out of laptop's speakers and windows playback devices showed headphones were unplugged.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>in Realtek's software it thought, that headphones were plugged in as in the front plug and back was unplugged. </li>
<li>When from windows search and taskbar and task manager startup &amp; proceses there was 1 Realtek software, but from control panel Hardware &amp; Sound there was 2. 1 was the ""normal"", looked something like this:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FXwCc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FXwCc.png"" alt=""""></a><br>
but at the right there was only analog with back &amp; front, (I say greyed out means plugged out and normal plugged in) and the 2nd one looked like the right bar only.</li>
<li>After opening the 2nd from control panel, every time instead of one wich device did you plug in with options of external audio &amp; headphones I got 1 from both of them (tried both, no sound from headphones)</li>
<li>Dell doesn't work well with drivers. I had an issue with the touchpad since Windows 10 messed everything up. The middle click didn't work, resulted getting some really old Synaptics driver to make it work. Because the ones Dell provides do not work and Dell has some sort of rollback ""feature"" (even turning it off doesn't work) what ruined everything on that and after 1 restart also rolls the Realtek nonheadphoneworking driver(&amp; software) back to Dell's maxaudio or some sort. That has the I like to put your volume to 100% problem.</li>
<li>Problem b doesn't occur with playing music from groove nor steam music player.</li>
<li>Problem b isn't windows, because the 100% can be brought down by readjusting sound level, when sound board is 100%, windows hiddenly thinks let's say 26% and then I press a volume + button it goes to 28% then it says to soundboard to 28% now and then it goes. It is the sound board freaking out</li>
<li>I may refer the audio thingy as a card, by that I meant laptop's internal built into motherboard audio.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem Solves Ranked:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Some Driver fix, what works great, like a normal driver should and a way that it isn't rolled back by Dell (Note: Some forums say if you install the new driver multiple times it will sometimes stay)  </li>
<li>Program what plays passive noise, what is not audible (thinking of lowest or highest hertz) or if needed as little as possible audible. (googled around, didn't find one and as of right now I am unable to program one (really not in to complicated code, can edit it, but can't create) so it would be really nice, if someone good would program one.) (possibly can be closed by running it by argument /q or somehow other) (auto startup can be managed by start up folder.)</li>

is this any special settings for accessing wifi with mobile devices?<br>
how can I fix this problem?<br>
just for more info=><br>
the way I have connected two modems:<br>
1. Connect the first modem to the Internet and test it with its output(the LAN cable)<br>
2. connect the the LAN to the WAN port of the second router(tplink 8960N)<br>
3. and test the connection with a LAN cable from second router LAN1 port  </p>

"1356632","How do I automatically update weekly, monthly and annual totals when entering daily total","<p>This is my first time here so please forgive me if I did not find my answer prior to posting.</p>

<p>I have a spreadsheet that I use to keep track of my sales of an item. I keep track of this by day, week, month and year. I currently do the math in my head but would like to just enter a single number and have all the cells update. The cells would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>A1 = day</li>
<li>A2 = week</li>
<li>A3 = month</li>
<li>A4 = year</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently I enter my daily sales then add that ""by hand"" to the previous totals of the other columns so that each column has a total for its time frame.
The formula would basically be the same for cells A2, A3 and A4, and that is:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/fV4sg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Excel problem</a></p>

<p>basically I want a formula to use 2 or 3 cells, cell1 would be just an entered value, (the day sales), cell 2 would be a formula that adds the contents of cell 1 to the current value of cell2 and then updates cell2 with the new value, in your head you would simply add the new value to the old value and write down the new value total, however excel doesn't seem to have a ""hold"" option like our memory so that is where the issue is coming.</p>

<p>I hope this example helps to clarify what I am looking to accomplish.</p>

<p>Now in my head this is very easy to accomplish however Excel refuses to do it easily.</p>

<p>I have been trying to find a solution however I do not even know how to pose the question other than as I just did, I have looked for tally, cycle counting, count ups, etc. however nothing gives me what I want.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that I use VBA, but I found no clear instructions for that either. I would be immensely appreciative if someone could help me with this.</p>

<p>This does not work because it returns NUM! error values for totally blank columns or columns with less than five numerical values.  This workbook will have ""future"" days and sheets that are blank, but have the formula pasted or templated in, and the whole workbook from H2:J6 is averaged and stdev'd on sheet1.

"1224658","Windows Built In File Server","<p>Consider the following situation.  You have two computers in a room.  They are connected by a LAN.  They are not connected to the internet.  They are both running clean copies of Windows 10.  They have <strong>no usb ports or cd drives;</strong> just the ethernet port.  Suppose I have a file on computer A, and I want to get it on computer B.  Is there any way this can be feasibly done?</p>

<p>In Linux, for instance, you could use netcat if that came with your system, or I think in some circumstances, you can cat the file to a special directory, or usually sftp comes preinstalled.  Is there anything like that on Windows, anything built in that can be horribly abused into performing the required function?  Ftp comes with windows, for instance, but only the client, I think.</p>

<p>Even manually typing out a file with the binary code for a file-sender would be...acceptable, IF it's short enough to actually memorize in a half an hour, though this method would be rather less than desirable.  You'd also need to specify how to input a binary file.  (I think you could probably use Internet Explorer and its developer tools, though I'm not sure.)</p>

"1125417","Which .dll or other system file(s) manage(s) the IP / network settings in Windows?","<p><strong>(sufficient) short version:</strong></p>

<p>I have a Win XP3 pc. When I set the TCP/IP settings of my network connection from DHCP to fixed, everything seems ok, but in fact, the TCP/IP settings are not registered in the system, which makes that then, without both DHCP or the manual TCP/IP address, my pc will not connect to the network anymore, albeit officially, the ""connection is active""... but without any IP, etc.: the respective info table (NOT: the table where you enter the settings) shows empty values.</p>

<p>My problems do NOT arise from the possibility that I weren't sufficiently informed of HOW to set those IP settings (both my VoIP telephone and my printer work fine in that network).</p>

<p>My problem arises from the fact that obviously some other application I insuccessfully tried some months ago (""OkayFreedom"") and which gave me a lot of trouble, has damaged one or several dll's or similar which are responsible for IP settings, their changes and/or their ""activation"" within the pc's Windows system.</p>

<p>Reinstalling Windows from scratch is out of the question, too many applications with their respective settings.</p>

<p>But I kindly ask if somebody could just <strong>identify/name which dll's or such are concerned here</strong>; from another (unused, also XP3) pc, I then could try and copy these onto the damaged ones on the pc I work with.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Long (previous) version (NOT needed):</strong></p>

<p>I have a Linksys WAG160Nv2 modem-router for the web, and which I try to also use as the central point of my home network (router, VoIP telephone, pc, printer, second printer), all by LAN (cable) only (I do not use smartphones, tablets or such).</p>

<p>I have problems with the printers, so I tried to replace the DHCP with fixed IP addresses, starting with my pc, which runs on XP3 (will not change that anytime soon, too much software with specific settings).</p>

<p>Here, I should add that Linksys routers do NOT:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>display a list of connected devices with fixed IPs, which also means you cannot set up a fixed IP for the pc FROM the router, but you must do that from within the pc, and then hope the router will ""get"" that over the web</p></li>
<li><p>have ""DHCP reservation"" (which should not be the problem here, see below)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I strictly followed the hints found on the web:</p>

<ul>
<li>in my pc:</li>
<li><p>I looked up the active connection, and changed its settings ""Details of internet protocol (TCP/IP)</p></li>
<li><ul>
<li>FROM: ""Get IP address automatically""</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>TO: 192.168.1.10 (the router has got the address 192.168.1.1, and sets its DHCP addresses from 192.168.1.100 on, so 192.168.1.10 fixed for the pc should not be a problem, that address being outside of the range of DHCP addresses set by the router=)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>then, the pc automatically set the ""sub net mask"" of the pc to 255.255.255.0, the same is displayed in the router</p></li>
<li><p>then, I had to put it the ""standard gateway"", but I had read in the web that you enter your router address here, since the router is your gateway to the web, so this was 192.168.1.1 here</p></li>
<li><p>then, I entered ""preferred DNS server"", and web info told me that here again, you enter the address of your router, since in these home network cases, it's the router which resolves internet addresses for you, so this was 192.168.1.1 again (I left blank the ""alternative DNS server"" of course)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then I clicked on ok, and everything seemed very ok:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I could continue to access the web</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced IP scanner showed the correct, new IP address for my pc (and the correct DHCP-assigned IPs of my other stuff, and of course the correct IP of the router.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That was yesterday. Let me add that I did NOT touch any other pc setting except those described, in the way I described them. Today, after restarting my pc, I was unable to access the web, and I was unable to access the router: - no router access from my pc, by entering 192.168.1.1 in the browser address line (after pressing ""return"" then of course) - everything ""dead"" in ""Advanced IP Scanner"" (which lists ""old"" entries, too, but declared them as ""dead"") </p>

<p>Thus (1), I reset the pc connection settings, within the pc, to DHCP, for the IP address and for the automatic DNS: No chance; I restarted the pc: no chance either.</p>

<p>Thus (2), I had to reset the IP configuration of my pc by the respective DOS commands to the factory settings (and restart the pc, of course), and then, it got SLOWLY back to normal: I entered 192.168.1.1 in my browser again, in order to access the router, and it took several minutes for the settings window of the router to appear in my browser, and every further router window change was extremely slow; also, web pages took several minutes to build. After several such minutes where the router was clearly working, but at extremely low speed, all reverted back to normal, i.e. I now have normal-speed internet access again, and the router is correctly identified within ""Advanced IP Scanner"" again.</p>

<p>But this is with the old, DHCP settings, i.e. my pc has got its ""dynamic"" IP address assigned, as before, by the router, and which is exactly what I had hoped to avoid, by trying to assign fixed IP addresses, starting with the pc; it goes without saying that I did not try to assign other fixed IP addresses, to the printers, in light of my experience with trying to do so for the pc. Hence my question what may have caused the broken connectivity between router and pc, after the pc had been restarted today?</p>

<p>EDIT (belongs to unneeded long version):</p>

<p>Thank you for editing, and for your valuable hints, 528fb!</p>

<p>I can now be much more precise. The problem does not lie with my router, but with my pc.</p>

<p>I was able to set a fixed IP both for my telephone and for my ""problem"" printer, the other printer will certainly be easy, too. My network tool mentioned above lists these devices, and from my pc (with DHCP-set IP) I can access them, so technically my problems are resolved since the router, as said, starts assigning the DHCP numbers by 192.168.1.100 (the range can be set there), and when every other device has a fixed IP, the DHCP IP for my pc will ALWAYS be the 100.</p>

<p>But I would very much like to know where the problem lies.</p>

<p>Whenever I set my pc to a fixed IP, it will not have access to the router, and by this, not to the web, neither to the printer, etc.</p>

<p>ipconfig, from the pc, does NOT find the pc, and my network tool mentioned above does not find anything ""alive"" since the pc on which it runs is not really connected to the network, whilst ""Status"" of my connection (""Intel PRO/100 VE"") is indicated as ""connected"" / ""connection established""!</p>

<p>Selecting ""repair"" gives:
""Could not repair since TCP/IP is not activated (!) for this connection.""</p>

<p>When I select the settings table for the TCP/IP for the connection, all entries are as described above, with full IP, subnet mask, standard gateway, and the according checkbox for TCP/IP in the list is always checked of course.</p>

<p>But when I click on ""Network support"" tab for ""this connection"", I get EMPTY values for Address type, IP address, Subnet mask, Standard gateway and Details</p>

<p>I fiddled with all this for several hours, and it clearly seems that with my fixed IP settings, there is then a missing ""activation"" of these ""fixed"" IP, and since to fix the IP, I had to de-select DHCP in the pc window, now the router has no chance left to assign some IP by DHCP, and the result is that the pc ""believes"" it is connected to the network, but does not have a network address and thus no REAL connection to the network.</p>

<p>I suppose now that somewhere in the past, a Win XP dll has been damaged, by some application, so it seems I would need to replace that dll. Of course, this would imply I first identify the dll, then get it.</p>

<p>I have another old pc I never use, also with XP3; theoretically, I could copy the needed repair dll from over there IF I knew which one it is, or to which GROUP of dll's it belongs.</p>

<p>I also could copy everything from the Windows folder over there into a parallel folder on my working pc, and then compare the ""last change dates"" of everything, but it seems to be evident these would be hundreds if not thousands of system files which are not identical anymore, and if I copy every which file from there into my working system, that system will NOT work anymore.</p>

<p>Thus, I'm stuck with my question which has now become mostly theoretical, since my system, while being damaged in the above respect, works fine otherwise.</p>

<p>Except for somebody knowing perhaps those 1, 2, 3... 5 dll's I should (and could safely) renew, in order for my pc allowing me to assign a fixed IP to it again?</p>

"1125516","Computer does not boot with single RAM stick","<p>My computer has 2x2GB RAM right now and this works fine. I got one stick (from another computer) that is 8GB and I want to put it into my computer. All memory is DDR3.</p>

<p>However, the computer does not boot at all if I have a single stick in any of the channels - it just sits there with a black screen and doesn't even go to BIOS, so I have no idea what it's upset about. </p>

<p>I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting 8GB into slot 1 (out of 1-4), no other RAM. Same problem. I've tried it alone in all four slots.</li>
<li>Putting 2x2GB into slots 1+3, 8GB into slot 2, same problem</li>
<li>Putting 8GB into slot 1, 2x2GB into 2+4, same problem</li>
<li>Putting 1x2GB into slot 1, no other RAM. Same issue.</li>
<li>Increasing the DRAM voltage slightly (to 1.51), same problem.</li>
<li>Changed the DRAM timing to match the new stick, same problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I don't think it has to do with the RAM stick itself, but rather the motherboard or the processor I guess. I was under the impression that all motherboards would support a single RAM stick regardless, but apparently that isn't the case?</p>

<p>My hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD FX-8320E</li>
<li>Motherboard: MSI 970</li>
<li>RAM 2x2GB: Corsair CMX4GX3M2A1600C9</li>
<li>RAM 8GB: Corsair CMV8GX3M1A1600C11</li>
</ul>

<p>My BIOS is up to date (M40). What could be going on?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I think it's the RAM stick. I got my computer to boot with 1 or 2 of the 2GB sticks that I currently use after resetting the BIOS. But I cannot get this new one to do anything. Oh well, guess it's back to the store tomorrow!</p>

"1525298","Has anyone successfully ripped a DVD using dvdbackup through a VM?","<p>Just looking for some help with ripping a DVD if you have some time to mess around with this. I'm running the following setup right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 10 64bit with all updates</li>
<li>Oracle VM VirtualBox version 6.1</li>
<li>Fedora server 31 VM</li>
<li>dnf install -y libdvdcss dvdbackup ffmpeg</li>
</ul>

<p>This exact setup works great on physical hardware, but ripping through the VM throws a bunch of read errors. The odd part is, some of the blocks copy without error. I can even concatenate the resulting VOB files into a somewhat watchable file, but of course it's all kinds of glitchy.</p>

<p>Here's the standard string I always use. Pretty straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>dvdbackup --input=/dev/sr0 --error=m --feature --progress; eject -T
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried sharing the DVD drive in Windows and then mounting it in Fedora. Same result. Anybody got this to work? I also tried switching to VMWare Workstation Player, but no love there either.</p>

<p>Standard error you usually see with a dirty or scratched DVD:</p>

<pre><code>padding 512 blocks
Copying Title, part 3/7: 88% done (906/1024 MiB)
Error reading VTS_03_3.VOB at block 1512416, read error returned
</code></pre>

<p>I presume you can't just copy the VOB files from the DVD to the computer. Windows and Fedora won't do it. It creates the files in the target folder, but they're like 64KB or 0KB sizes.</p>

<p>I know, why not just rip the DVD using the physical hardware, dummy? Well, my Fedora machine died and I'm out of spare parts right now to Frankenstein another box together. Thanks in advance!</p>

Why?","<p>I'm trying to get Cygwin (CYGWIN_NT-6.1 / 2.11.1(0.329/5/3)) to start with <code>tcsh</code> as default shell on Windows 7. I read <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/940529/how-to-change-the-default-shell-in-cygwin"">this question</a> and answers there but had some issues with the mintty method mentioned in <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/940556"">this particular answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you start Cygwin with <em>mintty</em>, then add the shell as a parameter.  <code>mintty /usr/bin/zsh -</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>using the trailing dash to invoke an interactive shell(?), makes a window flash and disappear again (whether or not I use <code>-l</code>)</li>
<li><code>mintty /bin/tcsh</code> without the trailing dash or <code>-l</code>, a Cygwin shell window is opened, but many builtin commands result in ""fatal error - cygwin base mismatch is detected..."". I searched for and found an older version of <code>cygwin1.dll</code> (in ConEmu/wsl) as directed by the error message, renamed it, but to no avail - I keep getting the same error</li>
<li><code>mintty /bin/tcsh -l</code> gives the best results, but starts with the home directory as Windows %USERPROFILE%. This means it also bypasses my <code>.tcshrc</code> in my cygwin home directory (<code>&lt;CygwinDir&gt;/home/&lt;account&gt;</code>), but strangely, does process <code>.aliases</code> from there. Also strangely, the point above (<code>mintty</code> without trailing dash or <code>-l</code>) starts in the correct cygwin home directory.</li>
<li>I also tried editing <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>, as suggested by a different answer, but this made no difference.</li>
<li>Setting the Windows SHELL env var to <code>/usr/bin/tcsh</code>, as suggested by another answer to the referenced question, did work when launching from the desktop shortcut, but I don't think it's the ""proper"" way of doing it. When I run mintty from Windows command line, I get a failure message <code>""Failed to run '/usr/bin/tcsh': No such file or directory""</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why doesn't the allegedly good answer work for me? Can anyone say how to do it correctly? Also, can anyone explain the mysteries of the trailing dash, fatal error, nsswitch or the SHELL var?</p>

<p>Let's try this again. I want to find text based on the HIGHLIGHT attribute. If it's not highlighted, then it's not of interest.</p>

<p>If the text was highlighted with Acrobat, then you can instruct Acrobat to find highlighted text. But if it was highlighted in Word then converted to PDF, then--as best I can tell--Acrobat will not ""see"" the highlighting. </p>

<p>So, how do you make the highlighting visible to Acrobat so that Acrobat can search it?</p>

"1360500","Why does Spotify take control of my Bluetooth earphones' stereo output?","<p>I own Bluetooth earphones, which I have paired with my Windows 10 laptop.</p>

<p>I can happily listen to audio from various different sources, until I play music through Spotify. Once I do, Spotify seems to completely hijack the stereo output device. If I pause the music and attempt to listen to another source (such as YouTube), I can no longer hear the audio playback despite seeing the amplitude bar move in the Windows sound settings. However, if I resume the Spotify music whilst the other sound source is still outputting, I can hear the other sound in the background of Spotify's output. Without restarting the earphones, I have found two ways of restoring the ability for other applications to output sound:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I right click on the earphones' Hands-Free device in the Windows playback device list and select ""Test"", I briefly hear the test output via the Hands-Free device and then suddenly the stereo output from the non-Spotify application continues.</p></li>
<li><p>If I close Spotify whilst music is playing (and so the other app's audio can be heard in the background), the audio from the non-Spotify application can be heard again. However, if I close it whilst Spotify is paused, the non-Spotify audio does not resume.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've <a href=""https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Spotify-mutes-all-sound-after-pressing-pause/td-p/4512212"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">found a hotfix</a> in which disabling ""Show desktop overlay when using media keys"" from the Spotify settings prevents this issue from occuring, but what is causing this strange behaviour?</p>

<p>Note: I've disabled the ability for applications to take exclusive control of both the ""Stereo"" and ""Hands-Free"" playback devices for my earphones, to no avail.</p>

Since several weeks tho it stopped working. The purpose is for specific cells on every sheets to be locked every time the Excel file is opened, and to have a button that if I click on unlocks everything at once.</p>

<p>Now, when I open the Ecxel file I get this message:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/i5gqA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/i5gqA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Finally, when I go the sheet36 (which is my summary page where the button to unlock sheets appear) and click on the button that unprotect all sheets, I enter the password and get an 1004 error:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Aq70k.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Aq70k.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In English: Execution error '1004': Invalid password. Verify that the CAPSLOCK key is not activated and that you are using the correct case.</p>

<p>Also the code to protect and unprotect all my sheets seem to have a problem, because the sheets are not protected when I first open the file. Here is the code: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/itOrA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a></p>

<p>Specific cells on all sheets are supposed to be locked when we open the file, and there is one button on sheet36 which unlocks everything with a password. But as off now only the ""unprotect button"" appears on sheet36.</p>

"1361608","CPU: What is more important when reading from HDD, processor speed or number of cores?","<p>I am considering which NAS to purchase, a Synology DS418play or DS419play.</p>

<p>The former has a Dual Core 2.0 burst up to 2.5 GHz, and the latter has a Quad Core 1.5 burst up to 2.3 GHz.</p>

<p>In either case, I will use 4x 7200 rpm HDDs, in SHR-1 mode (roughly RAID-1). Main purpose is accessing media files from a computer browser (however not transcoding media).</p>

<p>Onto the actual question: when deciding between processor speed vs. number of cores for getting the best reading performance out of hard drives, which is more important? Is the system such that it typically uses only one core for reading a drive, or does it use multiple cores for multiple drives? For instance, if it always uses only one core for reading <em>all</em> drives, that would indicate to me that processor speed is more important.</p>

<p>NB: This is not a request for purchase recommendations, e.g. it's not necessary to weigh in extraneous factors such as price. Mainly processor speed/number of cores and how they relate to performance in terms of SHR-1/RAID-1 is pertinent.<sup>1</sup></p>

<hr>

<p><sub><sup>1</sup>(There isn't really much of a price difference between the two models, so it's not a factor for this discussion. The former is aimed more to home-users and the latter is aimed to small business-users. I am a home user, so the NAS will not see concurrent users. But I am however interested in getting the best read/write possible with these drives.)</sub></p>

<p>I am asking the same question as I asked on askUbuntu (but did not get feedback).
References: <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/714839/uefi-mixup-with-previous-windows-10-disk-on-lenovo"">https://askubuntu.com/questions/714839/uefi-mixup-with-previous-windows-10-disk-on-lenovo</a></p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I have a lenovo laptop that originally had one disk with windows 10 using UEFI. I decided to replace the HDD with an SSD. Additionally, I replaced my DVD-ROM with an adaptor and put my older windows 10 HDD in there.</p>

<p>I installed linux on the SSD (with the second drive removed) and everything worked fine (UEFI mode). However, when I slide in the second disk, the computer goes into an infinite reboot loop as if it is trying to load from the 2nd drive.</p>

<p>I am only able to boot successfully by pressing the novo button and manually selecting a disk.</p>

<p>However, if I remove the second drive (holding windows 10), everyting works fine. I have tried changing the priority in the bios for UEFI boot order but it makes no difference.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>I also tried the utility boot-repair but no luck. Booting from the novo button all the time doesn't seem to be a solution as it's a good way to break that button.
Update</p>

<p>Here is the report from boot-repair: <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/14298897/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://paste.ubuntu.com/14298897/</a></p>

<p>Is there a chance I could delete the EFI partition from the second disk and solve my problem in that manner?</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The second disk with the UEFI windows 10 is causing the computer to be unbootable even if the first disk (SSD) has a proper UEFI system installed. </p>

<p>Currently, I ended up switching to legacy on the SSD and now my OS on there works fine but I still need to use the Novo Boot Loader (button) to load windows 10 from the second drive.</p>

The phone is a Sony Xperia Z2 running CM 12.1 (and is rooted). When I connect them using a USB cable, the phone appears in the device manager but nothing shows up in my computer. I want to easily be able to transfer large files between the computer and phone without using the internet.</p>

<p>Connecting the phone to the computer used to work fine and I'm suspecting some software updated that broke something.</p>

<p>As suggested, I uninstalled the driver from Device Manager, and tried installing it again. I downloaded <a href=""http://developer.sonymobile.com/downloads/drivers/xperia-z2-driver/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this zip file</a> from the Sony website, extracted, and followed the directions of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pBQLVmab1M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube video</a> to install the drives: in device manager added a legacy device, chose ""have a disk"", and selected <code>sa0111adb.inf</code>. This did not work. Now there are two drivers in device manager:</p>

<p>I also tried different USB ports to make sure. I don't think it can be a problem with the cable, since it still works with Windows 7 VM.</p>

<p>Even though Windows N doesn't come with the media packages, I have already installed them and it still doesn't work.</p>

  <li>Now open your browser and put default gateway in the address bar.</li>
  <li>Give your user ID password.</li>
  <li>Go to LAN settings and disable DHCP.</li>
  <li>Restart your computer and its done.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I also have some questions about the solution:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think that step 3 ""Now check your default gateway of the modem using ipconfig Command in CMD"" is done in Windows, but I am using Ubuntu. What shall I do instead? Which line in the output of which command in Ubuntu gives the default gateway of the modem?</p></li>
<li><p>In the next to last step, why ""Go to LAN settings and disable DHCP""? Does DHCP have any conflict with using the modem router as a router, or as wifi access point?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"1022156","Get the value of one cell based on the value of another","<p>Edited with additional context:</p>

<p>Embedded in a LibreOffice-5 Calc spreadsheet I have a two column array where one column contains dates and the other column values.  I wish to select the row based on the MAX date found in a range and return that value in one cell elsewhere on the spreadsheet together with the adjacent cell's value in a separate cell elsewhere on the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The way I conceive this is that the MAX(X30:X40) returns the most recent date.  I also want to derive from this result the address of the adjacent cell (Y?) and return that value as well.  For example given:</p>

<pre><code>          X        Y
30
31    20011231    205
32    20110106    171
33    20120715    321
34    20151031    165
35
36
</code></pre>

<p>and elsewhere on the same sheet this:</p>

<pre><code>          A        B
15                    
</code></pre>

<p>I wish cell <code>A15</code> initially to display <code>20151031</code> (X34) and <code>B15</code> to display <code>165</code> (Y34).  If later someone updates the empty cell <code>X35</code> with <code>20160101</code> and cell <code>Y35</code> with <code>37</code> then I wish cells <code>A15</code> and <code>B15</code> to recalculate to show<code>20160101</code> and <code>37</code> respectively.</p>

"1234075","How to identify memory hoarding service within svchost.exe process?","<p>I have a 64bit Windows 8.1 system operating under <em>Deep Freeze</em> and most of the time it is very very very stable. However at random intervals one of my processes, one of the many system <strong>svchost.exe</strong> instances, suddenly starts grabbing massive amounts of <em>Private Bytes</em> according to <a href=""http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Process Hacker</a>. Typically the process floats between 20MB to 80MB of memory but when this problem pops up it rises to about 1.5GB in less than 5 minutes and stays there for a while then just as suddenly starts to drop memory until it hits about 200-300MB and stays there a long time. Eventually it goes back to the normal range. Honestly I would not care much except that when that much memory is consumed the system comes to a crawl making many applications non-responsive and sluggish.</p>

<p>Using Process Hacker I can provide the following information:</p>

<p>The process command line is:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs
</code></pre>

<p>and the executable has been verified as Microsoft version 6.3.9600.16384</p>

<p>The services running under the process are:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/NEPSQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/NEPSQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What I want to know is how can I identify the specific service out of this list? Based on some filenames I have seen after the process starts dropping back down I suspect it may be that Windows is trying to update something but I have all automatic updates turned off since it makes no sense to try and update a frozen system. If Windows is doing something that I am not aware of then it is an off-the-books activity. </p>

<p>NOTE1: I am confident that I can rule out malware since the system was put in DeepFreeze the first day I bought it three years ago. Other than the custom software I installed (like MS Office 2010) before freezing it is pretty close to factory -- which I believe explains it's high stability. I only started experiencing the problem about a year ago and since that time I have rebooted a number of times which resets to the frozen state.</p>

<p>NOTE2: Trying to access certain properties of the process I get told ""access denied"" even though I am running the admin/sole user account on this machine.  </p>

All data has successfully been copied to an external drive after receiving the ""Bad Sectors, Corrupt MFT"" when an image backup was attempted. From brief review, much of the data appears to be duplicate folders/files that are already stored on another machine running Windows 10(HP Envy). The Dell 8500 also serves as a printer server for 2 printers.</p>

<p>The original plan after completing the HP build was to convert the Dell 8500 to Win 10 and install a 3 TB WD My Cloud both as a Cloud storage device and to support scheduled image backups. A 1TB Seagate external would be used to support image backups of the Cloud Data Storage as a redundancy. I know this is not the ideal configuration as an ultimate cloud/backup solution but budget mandates dictated the config as the most feasible affordable solution. So my few questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the best method to address the bad sectors; chkdsk /r, chkdsk /b or a third party solution?</li>
<li>If I run Win 7 recovery will that address the bad sectors AND the corrupt MFT files?</li>
<li>If both #1 &amp; #2 have to be run, which should be run first? I'm assuming chkdsk?</li>
<li>Will deleting the duplicates folders/files, estimated in excess of 200GB, improve the success ratio of ""repairing"" the bad sectors given that more ""free"" sectors will be available?</li>
<li>Is it reasonable to put forth the effort in converting the drive to Win 10, if repaired, or am I simply patching up holes in an already sinking ship? (the existing 1TB HDD with bad sectors). </li>

<p>Perhaps the wisest solution would be to install a 250gb SSD which should be affordable at

For example, a volume with size 8GB and formatted as FAT32 with 4096 bytes sized cluster would be having 2^21 clusters. Now the size of FAT would be <code>number of clusters * address size of a cluster</code>. Address size of each cluster is the number of bits required to store the address. Now as it is FAT32 it would be <strong>32bits</strong>. So size of the FAT would be <code>2^21 * 4(in bytes)= 2^23 bytes</code>. Maximum number of cluster address in a FAT would be 2^28 as 4 bits are used for special purpose.</p>

<p>A file of 4GB would span over 2^20 clusters. Total clusters available are 2^21
Now if we see any file(size is 4GB) the first cluster number at which the data of file starts would be available in the root directory, if that file is in the root directory. And further other clusters linked to the first cluster(where the file resides) can be obtained from the File Allocation Table(FAT). So what's the issue, we have 2^21 clusters and 2^20 clusters are required for the file of size 4GB. It should be able to store it. Why not?</p>

"1131574","What Programs, Drivers, Apps, or other third party software do I need after a clean reinstall of Windows 10?","<p>Ok so I have an Alienware 18. 1TB HD, 256 SSD, Dual Nvidia 860M's, 8GB RAM.
I was having some problems the other day and have concluded that it was a corrupt OS from <strong>Windows 10 Anniversary Update</strong> (Aug 5 Update I think?). Please review the question posted here if you feel things are not making sense or if you disagree on what the problem was and a resolution to it - <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1131242/how-can-i-fix-my-alienware-software-problems"">How can I fix my Alienware? Software problems</a> </p>

<p>It got messed up during installation and corrupted my OS to the point where my <strong>Start Menu</strong> wouldn't work I also could not use a <strong>System Restore</strong> point. I tried multiple restore points to no avail. I prayed it wasnt hardware problems, and after hours of exhaustive research I ended up doing a clean reinstall of windows 10 while keeping my files but it deleted all the apps and third party software. </p>

<p>I had to reinstall some apps for games, my <em>Razer</em> mouse, <em>Firefox</em>, <em>Chrome</em>, add ons for each (ie <strong>Privacy Badger</strong> and <strong>Adblock Plus</strong>). But surprisingly I also had to reinstall the <strong>Alienware Command Center</strong> and the <strong>Nvidia</strong> graphics drivers. I downloaded the Alienware Comand Center from Dell.com however it only gave me the option for 3.6 and not 4.0. I'm wondering if there is a compatibility issue or if i need to specifically search for the 4.0. </p>

<p>I also used to have a Battery Life Extender <strong>Desktop Charging Mode</strong> which allowed my battery to only charge above 50% to 100% in order to preserve Battery integrity however i cannot find that option anymore. I am curious if I just went to Dell.com and downloaded all their recommended drivers and programs if it will fill the missing items, or if there is a downside to that. </p>

<p>I have also ran a diagnostic check on the hardware both from Dell.com and from the <strong>Control Panel</strong> and everything has passed so I'm fairly certain it was just a bug in the Win10 Update. I had a minimal amount of data on the computer but the issue is my lingering question of ""what other things would I be missing after my reinstall?"" It gave a list of Apps removed while refreshing my PC however I'm not sure if it is a comprehensive and an all inclusive list. Here are some of the items I have not yet reinstalled as I do not know where to find them, and any help on identifying any other programs that might have been missed would be appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Apps Removed while Refreshing your PC</em></strong></p>

<p>Dell System Detect - Version 7.6.0.4</p>

<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable x(64) - Version 8.0.59192</p>

<p>NVIDIA 3D Vision Driver 372.90</p>

<p>NVIDIA GeForce Experience 2.11.4.1</p>

<p>NVIDIA Graphics Drivers 372.90</p>

<p>NVIDIA HD Audio Driver 1.3.34.15</p>

<p>NVIDIA PhysX System Software 9.16.0318</p>

<hr>

<p>As previously stated I reinstalled the Graphics driver and the Dell System Detect, but i have yet to do the audio one or any others. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>So for issues regarding clarity, I want to be very specific with my questions so i get an appropriate answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Will Dell.com allow me to download a driver manually, if i already have that driver?</li>
<li>If Dell.com allows me to download a driver that I already have, will it create problems because of the redundancy?</li>
<li>Are there any specific programs that Alienware computers come with (stock) that I should make sure i have?</li>
<li>How can I find a comprehensive list of what is missing from both a driver and application aspect (as Dell.com's <em>Guide me</em> automated driver search does not do what I need it to do)?</li>
<li>How do I get the Desktop Battery Charge mode available for use again? The button is currently greyed out and i cant click it</li>

"1131587","HDD imaging and data recovery","<p>I have a 1TB NTFS single-partition non-OS hard disk drive on my Windows Server 2012 PC, about 80% full, that has gone bad after a couple years of use. The drive retains the entire (now empty) directory structure, but all the files have disappeared, at least in Windows Explorer view (except for one folder that has files, likely because it's cached somehow due to a command prompt window with current directory at that location; however, attempting to copy these files fails because Windows isn't acknowledging their presence). </p>

<p>Disk Management reports a healthy partition and checking drive Properties via the Computer view in Windows Explorer shows used/free space as it should, as if nothing were affected. However, some data recovery programs like Recuva fail to read the drive (although they detect it) while some others like EaseUS painstakingly scan through the entire drive just to report 0 files found. TestDisk reports ""Partition: Read Error"" as well as read errors on every block it attempts to read; also System Logs show a large number of warnings with the message ""The IO operation at logical block address ### for Disk 1 was retried."" and a few warnings with the message ""The system failed to flush data to the transaction log. Corruption may occur in VolumeId: D:, DeviceName: \Device\HarddiskVolume3. (A device which does not exist was specified.)"". </p>

<p>I haven't run chkdsk /r yet for fear of causing further damage to the drive, neither have I rebooted since the issue started. There is a rare occasional light whirring sound from the drive that lasts maybe 5 mins or so, especially when I attempt scans. I'm not sure what to do -- I don't really care for the disk as much as I do about a few select folders of &lt;50 MB worth of data I need to salvage but am not knowledgeable enough to. I don't want to do anything intrusive to the drive (such as a chkdsk) until I can somehow make a copy of the data on the drive bit by bit to another location, lest anything were to go wrong. </p>

<p>Experts, assuming this is possibly an MFT corruption/bad sector issue, please can you assist with 
1. <strong>While the disk is still online, what program should I use to make an image of my drive (bit-by-bit copy) to a shared network location?</strong> 
&amp;, if possible, but optionally 
2. What recovery program might best suit this particular use case?</p>

<p>P.S.: I have tried the recovery tools listed <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/334247/hdd-data-recovery"">here</a> (Recovery Data for FAT &amp; NTFS: says ""End sector should be bigger than start sector"") and <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/87188/recover-harddrive-data"">here</a> (GetDataBack), as well as others listed above without success.</p>

<p>The first thing I tried to install was the ethernet controller driver, but I could not find out what driver to actually install. With the help of 3rd party software, I managed to find out the vendor and installed the driver (downloaded from a different PC). However I only got internet connection for the 1st couple of seconds, then I wasn't able to connect. </p>

<p>After a few reboots I finally had a stable connection (could access websites) but doing windows updates or downloading rest of the drivers through device management showed no progress. </p>

<p>I have no idea what else I could do in this case.. never happened to me before.

I read online that it could be a driver problem, but all my drivers are up-to-date, or a RAM problem, but I ran mdsched.exe (extended) and it turned up no errors. </p>

"1366198","Two internet connections in one house - Wifi and DHCP","<p>Before starting, I would like to mention that my knowledge on networking is very basic. Feel free to suggest improvements for my network setup in any part of my question. </p>

<p>I have searched the site for similar questions and I actually found many, but none of them answered my question.</p>

<p>My setup is very similar to <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/635515/two-internet-connections-two-routers-one-network"">this question</a>. We have two separate floors that each one has its own internet connection and modem-router with WiFi. </p>

<p>Note that both moder-routers are provided by the ISP, thus they do not offer many customization options.</p>

<p>Network details for each floor:</p>

<p><strong>Floor 1:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Gateway <code>192.168.1.1</code> (modem-router 's ip)</li>
<li>DHCP(<code>IPV4 + IPV6</code>) runs on modem-router assigns <code>IPV4</code> ips in form of <code>192.168.1.xxx</code></li>
<li>NetMask <code>255.255.252.0</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Floor 2:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Gateway <code>192.168.2.1</code> (modem-router 's ip)</li>
<li>DHCP(<code>IPV4 + IPV6</code>) runs on modem-router assigns <code>IPV4</code> ips in form of <code>192.168.2.xxx</code></li>
<li>NetMask <code>255.255.252.0</code></li>
</ul>

<p><em>NetMask may be wrong - Need consultation</em></p>

<p>Two networks are connected via a <code>10/100/1000</code> switch. The tasks that are performed in the unified network are very simple(file sharing, serving files via DLNA in clients).</p>

<p>For all wired devices I have set up static <code>IPV4</code> ips  and everything works as intented.</p>

<p>The part that I need help is with the wireless clients. <strong>I cannot control</strong> which gateway will a wireless device use to access the internet. </p>

<p>Explaining this, a device connected to the WiFi modem-router of Floor 1 may get ip from the DHCP of modem-router in Floor 2 and backwards. I am pretty sure that this is caused by the nature of the DHCP which claims that the quicker wins.</p>

<p>I know a solution would be to disable the DHCP in one of the floors, but I assume this will result all devices(with auto DHCP settings) connected to the network to use the internet bandwidth from the floor where the DHCP runs.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
So my question is how can I force wireless clients to get ip from the DHCP of the modem-router they are connected? </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Is it doable with the existing hardware?</p>

<p>gave me exactly what I needed to execute this task.  Later, I discovered that I needed to do that, plus add additional criteria from a separate column.  I have been to numerous websites and have tried a number of different formulas to make this happen, but, thus far, my formula has failed every time.  To give you a visual of what I want to do, I've included an image below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/YEaGB.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p><strong>It may help to know the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Total number of items in Column E are fewer than those in Column T (by a substantial amount).  </li>
<li>Cells in Column E contain a single word and no duplicates exist within that column.  </li>
<li>Cells in Column T contain a single word and no duplicates exist within that column.  </li>
<li>Cells in Column V contain either ""Match,"" ""þ"" (the checked box), or are blank.  </li>
<li>Contents of cells in Column E may or not exist in Column T.  </li>
<li>""Match"" indicates that cells in Column T match words in a column not shown in the image above.  In other words, it is not intended to convey a match with the contents of cells in Column E.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, here is what I would like to do with these columns of information:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>If the contents of a cell in E do not match any of the cells in T,</em></strong> return ""V3 Only"" in Column X.</li>
<li><strong><em>If the contents of a cell in E are found in Column T AND Column V contains ""Match,""</em></strong> return ""Match"" in Column X.</li>
<li><strong><em>If the contents of a cell in E are found in Column T AND Column V contains the checked box (""þ""),</em></strong> return ""þ"" (the checked box) in Column X.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I hope this isn't too difficult to solve.  Despite my difficulty in arriving at a formula that can execute this, I have a feeling someone in this community knows how to set this up.</p>

<p>In case it makes a difference, I need this formula to work for Excel 2007.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>First off: I have a new Dell Inspiron 3793 (few weeks) and wiped the Windows installation from it right away and installed a fresh Linux Mint 19.3 onto it. The past weekend I treat my laptop with an additional 8 GB of RAM (the manufacturers differ but the specs are exactly the same, I made sure of that). Yesterday I wanted to check whether a certain game could run on my system and since it is a Windows only game I decided to install Windows 10 alongside Linux. Since I put my system and data partitions at the beginning and the EFI partition at the end of my SSD (which may be not the best of decisions) the Windows installer warned me that I had an unusual setup of partitions when I created the NTFS partition right in the middle of my drive. Knowing that I would reinstall GRUB after that anyways and thus ignoring the warning I installed Windows and checked that it was running as intended. After the first check I shut down the system, inserted my Linux Mint live USB stick and was about to get ready to reinstall GRUB. Unfortunately it refused to boot and the boot log contained the following message:</p>

<pre><code>The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)
</code></pre>

<p>After some googling I found out that the cause was probably the fast boot feature in Windows. So I restarted my machine and booted back into Windows, about to disable fast boot, but now Windows wouldn't boot anymore and instead hang during startup. After rebooting the system several times, getting even blue screens (the ones with the QR code) now and then and having no luck with booting back into Windows, I decided to wipe the whole disk and do a proper Windows 10 installation first and then do the Linux installation.</p>

<h3>Main issue</h3>

<p>Now I'm stuck in a state in which I can't install any operating system on my machine at all. The Windows installation goes through up until the first reboot, then it hangs with the Dell logo and the loading circle beneath it. Sometimes I can make it through to the point where it says something like 'preparing devices xx%' (I'm installing a german Windows so can't tell whether it translates like that) on black screen eventually being stuck somewhere between 86 and 93%. I don't know what devices are being prepared during that stage.
Plus, not a single Linux live stick is willing to boot anymore, they all get stuck halfway through the init process. I tried it with my Linux Mint live stick, which worked like a charm on that very system before. I tried an Arch Linux image and Boot-Repair-Disk. Neither of them would boot correctly. I also tried reinstalling Windows several times with different images. I tried the original 1909 image by Microsoft as well as both Windows 10 images provided by Dell. They all managed to perform the first installation round until the first reboot. Then the system hanged again.</p>

<p>Now I'm at the end of my knowledge and feel kind of lost since I don't know what's causing this behavior. Even if I wipe the whole drive and remove all boot entries from the BIOS menu (or even reset the BIOS settings to factory defaults), no operating system will get installed as it should. It's as if something got stuck deep in my system during all these reboots and reinstalls and won't get out even if I reset everything.</p>

<p>I hope that I can get my system back to working and that someone has a good idea what could go south. I am desperatly lost right now and I appreciate any help. I can provide more information if needed, just tell me how to obtain it.</p>

<p>I have a Dell, Inispiron 15, laptop that came with WIN 10 Pro Ram,  i7 -2.5 Gig processor, 1TB Disk drive.   Using laptop keyboard and wireless  preinstalled, about  8 months old. with no pre-installed Dell “blote ware”.   I have 8 Gig mouse.  No other changes in performance.</p>

<p>I use the “SLEEP” command rather than a shutdown when I finish a computer work session.  To restart I tap the “power on” button or the “enter” key and WIN10 starts where I put it to “SLEEP”, with no problems.</p>

<p>The problem:  After about the second or third time of waking up from the “SLEEP” mode the response of text typed on the keyboard and commands selected with the mouse begins to slow down.   Specifically, typed text begins to show a lag before it appears on the screen and mouse generated commands also show a lag before the finish of execution.  The lag is not program dependent; typing text into an email, a Word document or any other document has the same delay.   Same applies for mouse commands; selecting an email document to open, tapping “enter” to change web pages or the “save” command in Word – all have the same delay.</p>

<p>The more times the “SLEEP” and restart sequence is preformed the longer the delay becomes. By the 5th or 6th  cycle the delay is several seconds and only about the first 4 or 5  typed characters appear.  Several seconds later the remaining typed characters will appear, but not all characters of a long sentence.</p>

<p>If I “shutdown” instead of “SLEEP” and then restart the delay is not present.   As far as I can tell, even after several hours of use the “typed text appearing on screen delay” has not appeared.</p>

<p>What is causing the delay?</p>

<p>Why does it happen only in “Sleep” mode?</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a way to set up a domain to dynamically select from server IPs. This way I could install the exact same configuration I have on my main server on all subsequent servers and just leave the script as it is. </p>

<p>Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Here's the reverse proxy I've set up. On the other servers I have set up a virtualhost with the same name ""main.website.com"", but for some reason when the pages load there's no CSS. Looking at the server logs it seems like the server I'm proxying to isn't using the right virtual host and is using the default one.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;

<p>For example</p>

<p>Suppose I have this data</p>

<p>This is unsorted</p>

<pre><code>2   1   4   3
1   3   3   2
5   1   1   4
5   4   2   5
1   2   5   5
4   3   3   1
3   2   5   4
1   5   1   5
4   4   1   2
1   4   4   1
5   3   2   4
3   5   1   3
2   4   3   3
1   2   3   1
5   1   5   1
</code></pre>

<p>I want to sort by col A, </p>

<p>So then   all the rows where col A have like values, will be bunched together.</p>

<p>For each of those bunches, I want to sort by Col B, and for each of those bunches i'd like to sort by Col C, giving an end result of</p>

<pre><code>1   2   3   1
1   2   5   5
1   3   3   2
1   4   4   1
1   5   1   5
2   1   4   3
2   4   3   3
3   2   5   4
3   5   1   3
4   3   3   1
4   4   1   2
5   1   1   4
5   1   5   1
5   3   2   4
5   4   2   5
</code></pre>

<p>So, I haven't done anything with column D.</p>

<p>I can break that down if it's unclear, but i'll use a smaller example..</p>

<p>One can sort by col A,</p>

<p>Then space it out e.g.</p>

<pre><code>1   3   3   2
1   2   5   5
1   5   1   5
1   4   4   1
1   2   3   1

2   1   4   3
2   4   3   3
</code></pre>

<p>then sort each chunk by col B  so the chunk where Col A contains 2s, in this case, is already sorted by Col B.  And we get</p>

<pre><code>1   2   5   5
1   2   3   1
1   3   3   2
1   4   4   1
1   5   1   5

2   1   4   3
2   4   3   3
</code></pre>

<p>And then to sort by col C (each identical A,B), one could space it out</p>

<p>So we get</p>

<pre><code>1   2   5   5
1   2   3   1

1   3   3   2

1   4   4   1

1   5   1   5

2   1   4   3

2   4   3   3
</code></pre>

<p>And we see there we have a lot of chunks of 1 row so nothing to sort.  We have one chunk of two rows and they are not ordered by col c yet, so they'll get reordered.</p>

<p>So</p>

<pre><code>1   2   5   5
1   2   3   1
</code></pre>

<p>will become </p>

<pre><code>1   2   3   1
1   2   5   5
</code></pre>

<p>The rest remain the same, and so we get</p>

<pre><code>1   2   3   1               
1   2   5   5
1   3   3   2               
1   4   4   1               
1   5   1   5           
2   1   4   3               
2   4   3   3
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that it's sorted by Col A, Col B, Col C,   in the sense of, it's sorted by  Col A, and for each chunk that is like within Col A, it is sorted by col B, and for each chunk that is like with Col A and Col B, it is sorted by Col C.</p>

<p>I'd like to know if there is a rather automatic way to do that in excel, rather than rather manual process of sorting each chunk?</p>

"1132804","Line plot with two lines which have different x and y series","<p>I have been doing an experiment were I studied a process in which the decrease of the number of computers in a network over time led to a decrease in that networks performance (at a task). I have measured this under two different conditions. Now I have two tables in Excel 2016 as follows (example):</p>

<p><code>Computers | performance
 25        | 10
 14        | 7
 11        | 5
 4         | 0
 1         | 0
 0         | 0</code></p>

<p>And second table (in a different sheet):</p>

<p><code>Computers | performance
 25        | 12
 16        | 9
 13        | 7
 9         | 6
 4         | 3
 3         | 2
 2         | 0
 0         | 0</code></p>

<p>The number of computers is always between 25 and 0, the performance is always between 0 and 12. How can I create a line or scatter plot that shows both tables in one chart? I imagine having one line for each table in separate colors. The number of computers should be on the x-axis, so the x-axis should go from 0 to 25, preferably in descending order. The performance should be on the y-axis, so that should go from 0 to 12. </p>

To start with, I tried moving all my previous codes to the home directory, but I couldn't see any of those files in the bash terminal. It only works when I copy and paste those files in the bash shell. How am I supposed to do this? I don't want to save my scripts somewhere else and manually copy them into my home directory every time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided that I will keep those scripts where they were, and create a shortcut to their location from my home directory. Let's say the directory where I put all my files is called XXX, and there are three folders in that directory, YYY, ZZZ ,and AAA. I opened the bash terminal and created a shortcut using <code>ln -s /mnt/c/Users/.../XXX</code>. As expected, XXX appeared in my home directory. I opened the shortcut with cd XXX, and it did take me to XXX, but when I tried to access YYY from there, I couldn't.</p>

<p>When I type <code>cd YYY</code>, I'm taken to the <code>~/XXX/YYY/</code>, but when I used ls to check my files in YYY, I found that the content of YYY was exactly the same is XXX, meaning I see YYY and ZZZ in the YYY directory. I tried again, with cd YYY, which took me to <code>~/XXX/YYY/YYY/</code>, and so on. I could never get into the YYY folder. The same situation comes up for ZZZ too Thanks to anyone who can solve either one of my two problems</p>

<p>My motherboard, however, which is an ASUS WS C422 SAGE/10G only has 3.1 connectors. The front panel USB connector is labeled U31G2_E3 and has a 20-pin USB 3.1 Gen 2 female socket. The motherboard documentation says nothing about backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>The motherboard also has a USB 3.1 Gen 1 header. Documentation that came with the motherboard says that is DOES have backwards compatibility with 2.0. Currently, I have the 3.1 Gen 1 cord from the front of the case plugged into this header.</p>

<p><strong>So, the question is... how do I get the USB 2.0 in the front of the case connected to the motherboard?</strong> I seem to have two options:</p>

<p>(1) Find some kind of adapter that will allow me to plug the USB 2.0 cord into the 3.1 Gen 2 header. This assumes that 3.1/2 is backwards compatible with USB 2.0 and that such an adapter exists.</p>

<p>(2) Unplug the 3.1/1 cord from the front of the case from the 3.1/1 header on the motherboard, plug in a 3.1/1 ""module"" (mentioned in motherboard manual) whatever that is, and that module will provide both a 3.1 and a 2.0 header on it maybe? I have not seen what this module looks like so I don't know.</p>

<p>Just so we are clear, on the left is what i have coming from the front panel, on the right is a 3.2 g1 motherboard header:</p>

"1367690","Program that turns on and off windows settings according to conditionals from cmd","<p>I have been meaning to make a .bat that turns on or off some windows settings so I could bind it to a keyboard shortcut. I made a .bat file that attempts to add a registry key NoDesktop so desktop icons could be hidden, if it runs a check in reg and is unable to find the key value, or delete the registry key if it is able to find the key value.</p>

<pre><code>@echo off

<p>but when I run it, the command prompt pops up and closes itself immediately. I tried then deleting all the parentheses but it shows a message saying the registry key is not found, which is good and should trigger the else command but it doesn't and it prompts me to exit. </p>

<p>what have I done wrong? I have also tried deleting all echo commands since I am worried that if a then b &amp; c else d &amp; e doesn't work in cmd. but it still shows that the registry key is not found and prompts me to exit. I have also tried tampering with parentheses and make sure they are all closed but its still not working.</p>

Thank you I have managed to fix the syntax and get the bat working well after some googling....but i still have a few problems:

<ul>
<li>A DrayTek (wired) router, which has two internet connections. Its LAN IP is 192.168.1.2 (/24).</li>
<li>A D-LINK (wireless) router retransmiting internet connection from the DrayTek,
with this configuration:

<ul>
<li>WAN IP 192.168.1.22   (so it can talk to the DrayTek router over wired connection)</li>
<li>WAN Gateway 192.168.1.2 ← router with internet (DrayTek)</li>
<li>LAN IP 192.168.0.1 (/24)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The wireless clients use 192.168.0.1 (the D-LINK router) as their gateway. 
I can access the setup page of the D-LINK router at the 192.168.0.1 address (by wireless), but I want to know if it is possible somehow to enter it by wired.</p>

<p>My PC is connected to the DrayTek router with cable (it doesn't have any wireless card, and it is too far from D-LINK anyways). I need to connect to the D-LINK router from this PC.</p>

<p>PC IPs:</p>

<ul>
<li>(wired) 192.168.1.150 ← the Internet can be reached through the DrayTek, but the PC can't access the D-LINK by its 192.168.1.22 IP address.</li>
<li>(wired) 192.168.0.150 ← just to try, but definitely not working, because there is no way to reach wireless network of the D-LINK.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried to redirect a public port in the DrayTek to the D-LINK (192.168.1.22:80) and it doesn't work.</p>

<p>I notice that the LAN cable is connected to the internet port of the D-LINK, so actually a solution can be to connect another cable in one of the LAN ports and using a static IP of range 192.168.0.x and it works... but the question still... is a way to access the router with the cable connected on its internet port (through 192.168.1.22)?</p>

It’s an HP Omen 870 with an Intel® Core™ i5-7600K processor, NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 graphics card 8 GB DDR4-2133 SDRAM, and a 1 TB 7200 RPM SATA hard drive which ran on Windows 10 Home 64. The full specs can be <a href=""https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/omen-by-hp-desktop-pc-870-245qe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">found on HP’s site here</a>.</p>

<p>For the last couple of days it will suddenly display a weird pattern on the screen, switching to various color schemes and various patterns. The usual color is pink and blue, but sometimes it'll be green and red. I wasn't sure what it could have been so I started looking at the error reports.</p>

<p>All of the critical errors were app runtime errors with ID 79. I reset the apps that were involved and then disabled any other apps that were downloaded through the windows store. Worked for about five minutes; then it crashed again.</p>

<p>I decided to do a diagnostics scan on the hardware in case it was the graphics card, but it all came back clean. So from there I decided to try to reset the computer to its factory settings. What ended up happening was that it wouldn't let me reset it for whatever reason and then it rebooted to how it was prior to being reset. I tried one more time and this time what happened was not only did it wipe the drive I think it destroyed the OS on the Hard Drive.</p>

<p>My leading suspect is a virus of some sort. I am not certain. I tried running an antivirus but it would always crash before I got any results.</p>

<p>Again I do not suspect a hardware issue because of two reasons: any diagnostics scan would return passes for all the components and I would leave it on all night running multiple scans and there were no issues. I tried using a separate hard drive, one from an old laptop, I had but the same issue occurred.</p>

<p>I'm worried that whatever it is, it is a virus that has infected the motherboard. The following image shows what my screen looks like when it’s about to crash. Note that it does not always crash, but 90% of the time it does. Also the photo is taken while using my old laptop hard drive.</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture, I had column  <em>J</em>  which is  <em>Date and Time</em>  and column <em>M</em> which is <em>Result</em>. </p>

<p>To make my work easier I added two columns <em>K</em> and <em>L</em> which are <em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> respectively.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/icEaH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/icEaH.png"" alt=""example picture""></a></p>

<p>I want to look at the first two rows in column <em>L</em> and if there is any <strong>hour missed between them</strong>, then add one row for each hour and put the cell in column <em>Result</em> to ""0"". </p>

<p>In the previous picture, there are two hours missed between <em>00:00</em> and <em>3:00</em>, so I want excel to add two new rows between them and add ""0"" in column ""M"".</p>

<p>Also check, if there is one day missed between two rows then add 24 rows between them. for example I need 50 new rows between <em>January 1,2010 11:00</em> and <em>January 3,2010 14:00</em> and the result zero for each row in column <em>M</em>.</p>

<p>The final result will look like this:</p>

<p>My problem is that the CPU fan has to face either up or down. It is not possible to place it in such a way that it pulls the air to the back, helping the two case fans.</p>

<p>My question is, in this case, what should I do? I see 4 options:</p>

<p>I must add the the distance between the heatsink and the top of the case is only 2 5/8 inches, and the fan is 1 inch thick, so if I was to place the fan above the heatsink it would be only 1 5/8 inch from the top of the case.</p>

So I think its safe to say that the backup got deleted in the whole process. It seems like formatting the drive is the best option so far. Any help anyone can offer on recovering my files would be appreciated.</p>

For some reason, only the folder structure was copied - my Documents has all the folders the older computer had but none of the files. The only files that were copied are Program Files, which the backup tool explicitly and correctly states shouldn't be copied since they're not useful to the new machine. Are all these problems just because I went directly from Vista to 10?</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't need help backing up the files. I just want to know why an official program does exactly the opposite of what it says, since jumping all the way from Vista to 10 doesn't seem like it would cause it.</p>

<p>In few words what I have done (UEFI settings):</p>

<ul>
<li>disks configuration -> changed SATA to RAID </li>
<li>went to Boot -> CSM -> Storeage OpRom Policy -> changed to: UEFI only </li>
<li>went to Advanced -> Intel Rapid Storage Technology -> created RAID1 volume and left SSD as non-RAID</li>
</ul>

<p>But when I go to the Boot menu and Boot Options I'm not able to setup SSD or RAID1 as bootable device (are not on the drop down list) so at that point Windows OS cannot be installed on any of those drive setups. Windows 7 installation states that any drive is not bootable. Intel RAID driver is loaded from the USB and all RAID disk are present there but with the message that Windows cannot be installed on any of them are not set as booting from. Message from Windows 7 installation process looks something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Windows cannot be installed to this disk. This computer's hardware may not support booting to this disk. Ensure the disk's controller is enabled in the computer's BIOS menu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On my local machine, and certain remote machines which I connect to via ssh, I can scrollback using both the scroll wheel on the mouse, and by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Page Up</kbd>.</p>

<p>On other remote machines I am not able to scrollback at all. Using the scroll wheel on the mouse cycles through previous commands (as if by pressing up), and pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Page Up</kbd> has no effect (other than sounding a beep).</p>

<p>AFAIK I am not using gnu-screen, tmux etc. I am opening a terminal locally and then ssh to the remote machine. </p>

<p>One thing to note is that the remote machine is a Google Compute Engine VM running their stock Ubuntu 18.04 image. Perhaps there is something unusual about the Ubuntu image GCE is running?</p>

<p>Having run htop on the remote server, this is the process hierarchy:</p>

<p>How to <strong>hold w</strong> when holding XButton1 on Logitech G502 using AutoHotKey? Problem is when holding the key with the script below it just sends a single output and not producing typical Windows-behavior which is really holding it (<em>see below for example</em>). Keep in mind that just because i'm intentionally using this for the purpose of playing fps games, but globally remapping it is much easier than including every game I so happen to play to be part of changing the LogitechG502's control buttons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it's cool to move forward in-game while grabbing hot cheetos with my other hand</p>

<h1>PROBLEM</h1>

<ul>
<li>I don't have a way to remap <code>XButton1</code> on my <em>LogitechG502</em> to replicate holding <code>w</code>

<ul>
<li>ahk-while command works but doesn't behave properly and acts as a press-release-press-release really fast even when slowed down using ahk-sleep</li>
<li>see below for solution on setting up several ahk-commands to remap LogitechG502's XButton1 to w to move forward while ingame</li>
</ul></li>

<li>None-so-far

<ul>
<li>Code suggested by user3419297 no longer works after a csgo update that was relevant to this very post</li>

</ul>

<h2>SAMPLE</h2>

<ul>
<li>Notworking: <code>XButton1::SendInput, w  ; mouse advanced button back as holding forward in-game</code>

<ul>
<li>Holding for 3-sec, <strong>XButton1</strong> (<em>w/ script above</em>) gives me: <code>w</code></li>
<li>Holding for 3-sec, <strong>w</strong> gives me: <code>wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Worksbutimproperuseoftoggle (<em>or fast repetition of pressing down W</em>):

<p>I ask this question because I have remotely been helping a user clean their computer. After refreshing, AVG found many (400+) registry errors.

I can access the settings page at 92.168.1.1, and in my computer's network settings, it says I am connected to the internet and have an ip address. However, whenever I try to load a page, it gets stuck on the ""resolving host"" step. Is there some setting that is missing that's preventing the router from working? Here's a screenshot of the settings page: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/izZeZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/izZeZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The numbers in the ""gateway"" and ""local dns"" field were originally 0.0.0.0. The internet didn't work, so I tried changing them to the values seen in the image (taken from my old router's configuration page), which still didn't help.</p>

<p>I used this firmware: <a href=""http://dd-wrt.com/site/support/other-downloads?path=others%2Feko%2FBrainSlayer-V24-preSP2%2F"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dd-wrt.com/site/support/other-downloads?path=others%2Feko%2FBrainSlayer-V24-preSP2%2F</a>

but I also did the 30-30-30 reset before and after installing.</p>

<p>Edit 1:
I tried setting up the dns, but this did not solve the problem. I set the gateway and local dns to 192.168.1.1. Then I set static dns #1 to 68.94.156.1 (att dns), and the 2nd and 3rd to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. I got one webpage to load, but it is one that I've visited often, so it might've been cached. No other websites will load. </p>

<p>I am able to ping my router (192.168.1.1), but I cannot ping google.com or 8.8.8.8. </p>

The did a major upgrade and I had to update to IE-11 for their software to work. Everything works fine, except for their CNBC stream. Its an embedded Flash-Player. But its not just this. No videos play at all Youtube, videos on websites... none of them.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying I have tried everything. Flash is current and enabled. Windows is all up to date. The ActiveX filter is off. I have gone through and tried every possible combination of the ActiveX settings and every other setting in IE both under the ""advanced"" tab and the ""programs/manage add ons"" settings.</p>

<p>And... when I go to Adobe's test page.... the little animated screen that has a tree growing with clouds floating by works fine.

<p>I have a GeForce GTX 970. if I wanted to use two screens am I better of using the graphics card as my main monitor (the graphics card as 4 HDMI  ports) and then using the port on the motherboard as the secondary card?</p>

<p>My thinking is that the motherboard internal graphics chip will not be used wile the pci express is taking over so if I plug it into the motherboard will it use the dormant chip to display the image and would that mean it will not take any work from the graphics card </p>

<p>I'm thinking about using hdmi for both screens my mother bored has an hdmi output it's also a gigabyte motherboard.</p>

<p>I want to use my office monitor purely for work related stuff and then my other monitor which is more comfortable place to play games as my gaming monitor so I don't need to run two windows just the one desktop.</p>

<p>So my question is should I plug both monitors into the graphics card hdmi both will display same image.</p>

<p>Or should I plug one into the graphics card and one into the motherboard? </p>

I had seen from videos that a lot of people's virtualization settings were under the security tab, but my mine weren't. I thought mine were not under the security tab because I hadn't set a password for system power up and BIOS password. </p>

<p>So I made a password for both, but my virtualization settings still weren't showing up under my security tab. Then I went and tried to restart my computer again, and then open BIOS again, but whilst doing that I found out that my passwords for my sytem power up and BIOS password was a bother, I clicked on the default settings for BIOS button (F9 for me), as I thought that this would restore my BIOS settings to before I had made the two passwords. </p>

<p>After I had restored the default settings, every single setting was locked, and I could not change a single setting. I found out that my virtualization settings was actually under the CPU tab, but I could not change it.

(This is temporally. I can't afford a portable HDD-Docking-Station or NAS for now. I also agree that physical isolation would be much safer.)
So I'm thinking if there's a way to make the disk inaccessible when it's not needed.</p>

<p>According to the information I got, we can ""disable"" a HDD with <code>DevCon disable [hardware ID]</code> or ""unmount"" a HDD with <code>mountvol X: /p</code> command. With this, we can come up with a scrip. If we pair it with Windows Task-Scheduler and backup software, the backup-disk should be safe except when doing the back-up. </p>

<p>However, it's not affirmative to me that the operation of ""disable"" or ""unmount"" can keep HDD from simply accessing or writing. Is it really doable? </p>

<p>P.S. This isn't my only backup copy, I just need to build another baskets for the eggs.</p>

<p>P.P.S. It's a little bit difficult for me to describe the entire story in English. Please feel free to correct or question me if anything was missing or not clear.</p>

<p><code>You attempted to reach some_web_site.org, but the server presented a certificate signed using a weak signature algorithm (such as SHA-1).

<p>And when I click <code>proceed</code> I get:</p>

<p><code>Reason : The SSL server certificate authority is not trusted</code>.</p>

<p>It's one of the state public service sites.</p>

<p>From my firewall I downloaded <code>SSL proxy default authority</code> certificate as p12 file and installed it in Windows in my trusted root CA. This certificate is valid until May 2022.</p>

<p>However, nothing changes. Is it my fault or the server owner? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The site loads just fine outside of my organisation's LAN. I can load it via my mobile phone 4G network. My firewall does web filtering and SSL inspection.

<li>Let's say that I plan to add later a couple of 80 GB disks to the cluster, and don't want to reinstall the whole thing. Is there a better strategy than use them to expand the virtual device ?</li>
<li>Let's say now that I want to tolerate two faulty drives with this new harware (1x40, 3x80, 1x320). I guess that the smaller is useless and I should do a RAID-6 on the remaning drives, giving me 160 GB of available space. Any better idea ?</li>

<p>There is a workaround, but as I've built this for some non-tech savvy users, I want it to just work. The workaround is, if you unplug the PC from the wall for 10 seconds, <em>usually</em> but not always it will boot using PCI-E graphics. If I restart, it will not switch graphics cards. This means workaround 2 is to never shut it down. :(</p>

<p>I have tried to disable the integrated graphics entirely in the BIOS. This just caused the mobo speaker to play the long 'no video found - but I'll boot anyway' beep.</p>

So I go to <code>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features</code> to uninstall it. <em>Except...</em> <strong>it's not there</strong>.</p>

<p>Using the Task Manager trick (right-clicking on the process and selecting <code>Open file location</code>), I find that the program is installed in <code>C:\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\uTorrent</code>. I deleted the folder, but I doubt that's the end of the program.</p>

<p>Is there a way to completely uninstall uTorrent? (e.g. using an <code>uninstall.exe</code>)</p>

"1033677","Will the torrent client ask trackers for the pieces matching certain hashes, or pieces included in certain torrent file?","<p>Imagine that we have two torrent files. They contain similar, but not exactly the same files.</p>

<p>For example, one torrent is same as the other, but has some text files at the end of it.</p>

<p>Knowing that these two torrents will probably share most of the pieces, are BitTorrent clients able to exchange these pieces with other torrents?</p>

<p>I assume that this will only be possible if peers ask for any pieces on the tracker which has the right hash, instead of asking for specific portions of the currently downloading file.</p>

<p><b>Example diagram:</b><br>
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/hgAeS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hgAeS.png"" alt=""Example diagram""></a></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - Just to be clear:<br><br>
<strong>1.</strong> I am not referring to running multiple instances of clients on a machine in order to download a file which appears in two torrents.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> I am not referring to downloading the same file with two different torrents.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> What I'm asking is, if two different torrents, by chance, contain identical ""pieces"", not files, can the pieces be used interchangeably from a tracker to another?<br>
<strong>4.</strong> To simply put it, I'm asking if it is possible for a single client downloading a single torrent file, to retrieve pieces from another torrent, assuming that those pieces are identical.<br> (Both torrents by chance include a piece with a same hash.)</p>

<p>For example, if I am only downloading torrent A, I will need blue and green pieces. Since Torrent B contains green and yellow pieces (not files), could it be possible to retrieve some green pieces from Torrent B?<br>
If I am correct, each piece should have its own hash, so, if both Torrent A and Torrent B contain the same piece, they should be able to use that same piece. The peer could ask for the same pieces by their hashes on a tracker, and if so, identical pieces with identical hashes can theoretically be shared between torrents.<br>The chances of two torrents having the same piece is irrelevant, I'm asking you to accept that we have this situation, and tell me what does the Torrent protocols do if this is met.</p>

"1141098","Can I send files to my PC from the web without having to download them?","<p>Is there any way I can transfer files from the web to my computer?</p>

<p>My Internet speed is too low, like 256kb/s download and I think 60kb/s upload. I was searching for a way to download files faster. I found a browser-testing site. I only have access to the browser itself, not the PC as a whole, so I tried a lot. Finally, I found a way: I signed up on pCloud and direct downloaded my file there from the browser testing site. I downloaded a 1 Gb file in 30 seconds, then I downloaded pCloud Drive onto my original PC.</p>

<p>I thought that since I have already downloaded the file to pCloud, I only have to copy and paste from pCloud drive to my original PC, but when I did that it said it would take 10 hours, and the speed was like 25kb/s. Then I realized that pCloud could not help.</p>

<p>Again I searched for browser testing sites or virtual PC web based drives. I found a site which can let me download anything from my browser, but I can't install TeamViewer or another program on their PC, just browser download.</p>

<p>I tried everything, like Chrome Remote Desktop, Zoho Assist in the Chrome Store, and all other online web-based remote PCs to transfer files, but nothing worked.</p>

<p>I then downloaded Airdroid on my Android, and sent my HTTP link to that browser testing, and it connected and I can send file but after 100% file complete it said “upload error”.</p>

<p>I then downloaded Xender, which is like Airdroid, and it also did not work.</p>

<p>I found another option on the Internet that says I can send big files. I uploaded a file there, but again my original PC has to download from there.</p>

<p>Is there any web-based way I can send files directly to my original PC, without my original PC having to download it?</p>

<p>Default installs of OpenSSH for Windows are installed on both.
The router is forwarding a port to Computer 1's port 22.
Computer 1 has a user Foo on it and Computer 2 has a user Bar on it.
I can connect from Computer 2 to Computer 1 via the forwarded port, but it requires me to login using the user Foo and its password.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible for me to connect to Computer 1 using either a user that doesn't exist in its Windows <em>user</em> database or without requiring me to type in Foo's password? I don't want to have to create a new account on Computer 1.</p>

<p>I've tried using the <a href=""https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>authorized_keys</code></a> method, but I couldn't get it to work.  I think because they don't have the same network name, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>NOTE that I don't want any additional HW investment.  This is to be lightweight so as to be easy to bring up and tare down.  Computer 2 shouldn't see the network of Computer 1 either.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/jsvTw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jsvTw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that its because the boot order is set to the USB.</p>

<p>But when I try to change it by going into BIOS, I run into the same error. This is my startup selection screen. When I press F1, I run into the same issue as before so its basically a loop that keeps sending me back to the USB.</p>

<p>How can I resolve this issue?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks for the answer su-tiger86. I have managed to get into the 
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/cC7Tn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">startup sequence</a>.</p>

<p>Now I don't get the Intel Error, but just a black screen.</p>

<p>So first, I went into Disk Management and tried to format the hard drive, but the option wasn't available so I deleted the driver. When I restarted the computer later, I hit the error ""<code>BOOTMGR is missing, Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to restart</code>."" Solutions online encouraged booting from a USB, so I got a Windows XP Pro ISO file onto a bootable USB drive, and by reordering boot priority in the BIOS, I got through the setup nice and easy.<br>
However, when it asked where I wanted to install Windows XP, only the USB drive appeared. The computer could not find the hard drive (Internet calls it ATAPI CD0). I installed Windows XP onto the USB drive anyways. All the files were successfully copied, but when the computer restarted and booted into USB, the Windows XP logo appeared, quickly followed by an error message: something was corrupted.<br>
Another purported solution was to reorder the BIOS again and put the hard drive first, but naturally, the <code>BOOTMGR is missing</code> error came back.The system recovery feature while booting on USB goes to a cmd-like window and doesn't actually clean the system. Besides that, I want to get the Windows XP onto the hard drive and not to boot from the USB.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to approach this problem?</p>

<pre><code>While working, Eclipse hanged suddenly. 
I waited ... after a while system crashed with blue screen 
             and was not booting up after hard restart.
</code></pre>

<p>Before I proceed I would like to mention :</p>

<pre><code>       a. My OS was Windows7_SP1_OS(hereafter referred as w7_1)
       b. I had only one drive C: of 981 GB (i.e. 1 TB)
       c. Drive C: was NTFS showing 981 GB with 834 GB used
</code></pre>

<p>Then What I did sequentially :</p>

<pre><code>1. Started a Clean Install of same OS with same Windows7_SP1_OS 
   on top of w7_1 with my bootable CD.

   Realised it will format and terminated within 2 mins.

   Instead then Did an Upgrade Install of same OS(hereafter referred as w7_2) 
   with same Windows7_SP1_OS on top of w7_1 with my bootable CD.

   While doing so, I kept everything just identical to w7_1 and chose: 
         DO NOT to format 
         Kept same no of drives , file format, space..etc etc anything u can imagine

2. Restarted fine with w7_2 and then :
       a. downloaded testdisk 
       b. created bootable USB Flash of Windows7_SP1_OS by WinToUSB 
                        (hereafter referred as w7_Boot) 
       c. planted the testdisk in the USB

3. Restarted fine with w7_Boot
       a. Tried testdisk deepSearch, analysis showed :

                NTFS found using backup sector, blocksize=4096, 998 GB / 938 GiB


4. While using TestDisk, I try to List Files on E, it shows not recoverable. 
   My MBR was OK. So did following -
  i.  Repaired by Creating new MFT [both MFT &amp; backUp MFT are messed up]
  ii. Fixed BS by Rebuild-BS(Boot Sector ) [ backUp BS was not OK ]
  iii. Re write Partition information by deleting partition M and saved Partition info

<p>Both USB Flash Drive and Computer have the program's based folder shared with full permissions to everyone.</p>

<p>If created a Mapped Network Drive to either one of these 2 folders, I assume that the program I run from the Computer would be running a lot faster than the USB Flash Drive correct?</p>

<p>Is this only because of the harddrive speed that it can read/write that determines the speed of the program and how fast it can run over the network?</p>

<p>What about number of computers running the same file?  Is the file technically being ran on the individual computer itself or does it matter what computer its being ran from to make sure it don't bog down a lot when being ran from multiple computers over the network?</p>

<p>Does it just come down to the Router/Modem itself and how fast it pushes the data?</p>

<p>Long story short, I'm just wanting to know if there is a major difference between running a program from a Mapped Network Drive that is located on either a USB Flash Drive or a Computer</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - Since I got a down vote for apparently not fully explaining the type of situation more specifically I'll add more details on why I'm asking.</strong></p>

<p>I have a program that is around 10MB big that is constantly reading/writing to a local SQL file that is stored in the Mapped Network Drive folder (the USB Drive or the Harddrive on the computer)</p>

<p>I have considered moving the folder to an external hard drive (or maybe even a small USB flash drive) instead of having the software installed on a computer just in case I need to move the USB/external to a new location in the future.</p>

<p>My biggest concern is in different ""environments"" this program can be ran over the network and be access from anywhere between 1 - 15 computers at the same time depending on where I am.  I want to know if I could expect a major speed different in the users running the program over the network off a USB/External as opposed to it being on a computer's hard drive instead.</p>

<p>Hi
I am looking for a way (in the form of an Excel formula) that can do this</p>

<p>I need to count the number of ""o"" in columns with headings ""Threat"", for each row. For example, I need counts of ""o""s in row 2, 4, 6, and so on, but only the ""o""s in columns with heading ""Threat"" in row 1. </p>

<p>BUT it gets complicated, I need more. 
I need to distinguish the counts of ""o""s, depending on if the cell beneath the ""o"" in columns ""Threat"" has the text ""P"" or ""A"".</p>

<p>So I need to find the way to count ""o""s in row 2, only in columns with the heading ""Threat"", and only the ""o""s with ""P"" in the cell underneath the ""o"".</p>

<p>Any advice will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Edit: Come to think of it, since the ""P""s and ""A""s are in the same columns as ""Threat"", the heading can be taken out of the equation!
So just need to find a formula that would help me count the number of a certain value in row 2, that are only in the column that has ""P"" in row 3. </p>

Yesterday I found out about <a href=""https://github.com/imperador/chromefy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chromefy</a> and really wanted to try and make my own Chrome OS build for my Matebook.</p>

<p>I managed to make the Chromium/Chrome OS hybrid bootable and it worked perfectly booting from a USB. When I discarded that and tried to dual boot Chromium and Windows the problems started.</p>

<p>After following <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBU4IObDI8IFhSjeCMvKw46O4vKCnfeZTGF7Jx8Brno/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these instructions</a> and restarting to boot up Chromium it did not show up in rEFInd or anywhere else.

If anyone could tell me exactly what i should get rid of it would be helpful. </p>

<p>Now after trying that and failing I tried booting up Chrome OS in the USB and installing it to an external HDD with roughly these Command (I changed the drive):</p>

<pre><code>chronos
sudo su
cd /
sudo   /usr/sbin/chromeos-install  --dst  /dev/sda  --skip_postinstall
</code></pre>

<p>It 'Successfully Installed' but when trying to boot up the HDD from rEFInd it did not show up at all, so I gave up on that and tried another approach.</p>

<p>I deleted all the partitions I had created for Chrome OS and formatted that 50GB space as a normal exfat partition. I figured if I could write a bootable IMG to a USB I could also do the same with this partition but nope. I tried a plethora of different programs to try and achieve this and none worked. I assume its because it formats the whole disk and I can't really format my SSD, but surely there must be a way to boot up this image from a partition the same way we do with USBs.</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<li>Etcher  </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lili</a>  </li>
<li>Rufus  </li>

<li>Chromebook recovery utility  </li>
</ol>

<p>I know dd could be also an option, but I don't know dd enough to do this myself. If anyone could help me with any of this or tell me which way I should be approaching this I'd greatly appreciate it. </p>

"1142984","Compatibility of purchased DVD burners with Dell PC","<p>my name is Kimon and I have recently asked from my father, Vasileios, to buy through the site with the URLs shown below two of the DVD burners they sell, the Optiarc AD-5280S-CB-PLUS and the Plextor PX-891SAF, both of which arrived two weeks after the purchase, and I would like to express a few queries that I have, as the store from which we ordered the products, RunTechMedia, has not replied to those same questions.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.runtechmedia.com/product.asp?sku=Plextor-PX-891SAF&amp;a=&amp;title=Plextor-Burner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.runtechmedia.com/product.asp?sku=Plextor-PX-891SAF&amp;a=&amp;title=Plextor-Burner</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.runtechmedia.com/product.asp?sku=5280S-CB-PLUS&amp;a=&amp;title=Optiarc-Burner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.runtechmedia.com/product.asp?sku=5280S-CB-PLUS&amp;a=&amp;title=Optiarc-Burner</a></p>

<p>To begin with, I would like you to tell me if they will be compatible with my European Dell Vostro 200 PC, given that my Region 2 current burner had also written on its sticker that it required the same voltage to function as the items shown in the URLs above do, specifically 5 and 12 Volts, but there is a difference in the corresponding current, namely for 5 Volts my old drive uses 1.7 Amps, while both of the newly acquired burners need 1.5 Amps and for 12 Volts mine uses 1.5 Amps and the Optiarc and Plextor 2.5 Amps, always according to their respective stickers. I had hoped that changing the Region would be the only thing I would have to worry about and do in order to use the burners and before I read the stickers I was under the impression, certainty even, that power requirements would not differ overseas. Therefore, I would like to be informed of whether there is a risk of damaging or, worse, destroying these USA devices if I connect them to my European PC. If there is, I would like to know what a possible solution would be. I have heard of power transformers and adapters before, but these seem to work with whole computers and not parts of them. So, I would like to learn if there is anything that can be done, like a device that anyone can recommend me for such cases, as the burners cost my father too much to be shipped to our country, to just watch them sitting on my office's desk.</p>

<p>In addition, I would like to know if anyone has a clue on whether or not the burners sold by RunTechMedia are new or used and, if they have been used, again, if it would be safe to install them on my desktop computer. The reasons why I am asking that question is because I assume RunTechMedia is a legit retail seller, and, although the products my father bought from them do not show any signs of wear, but, instead, they appear to be in perfect, flawless condition, one of the two has been manufactured in 2013, which would make it extremely hard to find now as new, and neither of them contained a box, as is the case with new products. If any people have a buyer's experience with them, their opinion would be greatly appreciated and desirable.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to thank you all in advance for the time you spent reading this post, for the length of which I apologise, as well as for any help and reply you may give, which I look forward to receiving!</p>

<p>Edit: At last, a clear, helpful response. To think that I even chatted with Plextor's technical service and the reply I got by an employee was, if I can recall correctly something like ""I'm no electrical expert but I am unsure that it (their burner) will work on your system"". If there is strong evidence to back up the theory about SATA connectors being universal power wise, then Plextor is quite wrong. Also, Vinpower Digital did not reply at all! And no, I have only 1 HDD and 1 burner, namely the default configuration by Dell, save for the burner which I intend to replace. I am currently a guest, so please let me know if and how I can vote for your answer this way. Thank you very much!!!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/e9TEB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Workstation Build Image 2 (in case, 2x GTX970's)</a></p>

<p>It is all working fine, except the CPUs are getting rather hot; they are going up to around 80/90c after a few minutes data processing on 100% load; I have been advised this is way to hot and they should be at around 60c.</p>

<p>The heatskinks and fans are connected and are spinning, but I cannot seem to find a way in the bios to get this to increase cooling.</p>

<p>The Motherboard is in the case and the case Fan Hub is connected to Sys_fan_7 on the MB (the only spare 4pin fan header). The CPU fans are connected to CPU_Fan_1 and CPU_Fan_2.</p>

<p>I have tried changing the limited options in the BIOS with no change; all there seems to be is an option for power or performance, but no related to CPU fans.</p>

<p>I have not updated the BIOS as I have been advised this could cause major issues if this fails, and have taken this advice as being a newbie system builder. </p>

<p>Additionally, someone else that had built this machine using the same parts as I, explained that after he updated the BIOS there was no drop in CPU temp; indeed as it now fully implemented the Turbo boost of the Xeon CPU's this infact increased CPU temp slightly.</p>

<p>Additionally I currently have two GTX970's in the workstation, which I have now removed to keep case and CPU temp down.</p>

"1143086","Why older CPUs perform better?","<p>By ""perform"" I mean have better scores on websites like cpuboss.com or userbenchmark.com. Is that a bad metric, perhaps?</p>

<p>An example: my old laptop has <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/71670/Intel-Core-i7-3632QM-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_20-GHz-BGA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">i7 3632QM</a>.

<p>Note the advantage in the single core test.</p>

<p>Then I compared it to a modern quad core (<a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/88967/Intel-Core-i7-6700HQ-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_50-GHz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">i7 6700HQ</a>):

<p>Now the score is closer, but the new processor consumes even more energy, 14 nm notwithstanding.</p>

But what I am having issues figuring out is if I can have the 2 computers talk to each other via the wired connection since they are part of a cluster.

<p>I know I could do this if I buy a bridge and then plug a router into it, which I then connect both of my devices to. However I haven't been able to find anything that can server as both a bridge and a router in one.  The idea is I do not want my cluster nodes to have to go all the way out over the wifi to talk to each other.</p>

<p>Or is the bridge smart enough to simply route the traffic between the two computers without going out to the main router via Wi-Fi?</p>

<p>I know I will have no issue with the computers communicating with each other. What I don't want is the 2 cluster nodes to have to use wifi to talk to each other.

"1546073","Data Validation based on Condition(s) in Excel VBA","<p>I was wondering if it is possible to only show items in a data validation list based on condition(s)?</p>

<p>Like for example, if I input AAA on cell A1, the data validation list in cll B1 will only show what's on its adjacent cells for example 1,2,3 or if I input BBB on cell A1, the data validation list in cell B1 will only show what's on its adjacent cells for example 4,5,6?</p>

<p>The catch here is the strings that are being written in cell A1 is dynamic. Like for example today I have 50 options to put in cell A1 all of which have their own named ranges to show in the data validation list in cell B1, then tomorrow it can only have 20 options.</p>

<p>Also, the number of items in those named ranges vary as well.</p>

<p>I’m on Windows 10 pro, I have updated to the latest version. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ORecK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ORecK.jpg"" alt=""poor quality pic of the screen after crash""></a></p>

<p>In addition to this, the audio and video stop playing occasionally, forcing me to restart. This is usually coupled with the user interface breaking.</p>

<p>Please advise, I need to get this fixed.</p>

<p>I have just been testing out other games. All seemed well until I started Shadow of Mordor. Before I did I had managed to get several smaller games and even Skyrim running successfully (with ultra settings I think it was) and there was no issue. But as soon as I started shadow of Mordor, the same thing as Shogun 2! What is going on?
Please advise! </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/emEcZ.png"" alt=""Task manager showing the state before opening Shadow of Mordor""></p>

<p>I thought maybe the GPU... but Skyrim ran fine. This is a problem that has only started occurring in the last couple of days. I am fairly certain the hardware is still fine. I've not had this machine long, and I had to open up the machine just yesterday to unplug the SSD(as I couldn't boot after the crash) and while I had it open I made sure everything looked alright and was in place. The system still detects everything as it should. 
I did have an issue when loading civ 4, as it said my machine did not meet recommended requirements(seems unlikely). </p>

<p>I feel like there is something these are all depending on that is failing. Perhaps flash? I know shogun 2 uses flash, and I have had trouble on chrome with audio and video not working, but that seems to apply across the board, not just to flash content. </p>

<p>Update: I forgot to mention when it crashed I started nothing but the shadow of Mordor after booting, which caused yet another crash. So it's not that I was drawing too much power.</p>

"1547663","Windows 10 4TB HDD formatted with MBR by Windows","<p>Yesterday I set up my new PC. I installed Windows 10 via a USB boot drive. My PC has an SSD which I wanted to use for the OS and important applications and then I‘ve got an HDD with 4TB for mass storage. I installed Windows 10 on my SSD. When I then after the install was completed tried to format my HDD (using Windows 10 built in tools) I saw that Windows for whatever reason did two stupid things. Firstly it automatically formatted my 4TB HDD with MBR instead of GUID which is why only 2TB of the 4TB can be used at the moment (even though Windows support says Windows automatically chooses a suitable partition scheme). That alone would not be a problem as I could easily reformat the drive. The problem is that Windows 10 for some stupid reason I cannot quite fathom decided to use ~500MB of the 4TB HDD and use it as some kind of security/recovery/etc partition... I do not know why Windows even did that because I told it to use the SSD for the OS. Now here is my problem: because Windows 10 allocated part of my HDD for itself I cannot reformat the drive or do anything else with it. I would really appreciate it if you know how to reformat my HDD (using GUID) so I can use all the 4TB of the drive. I would also like to know how to tell Windows to stop using the HDD for OS purposes (just the SSD). Is this by any chance possible without reinstalling the OS? Thank you for your time and answers! PS: Some further information: when I tried to boot into Windows while the HDD was physically disconnected Windows 10 did not boot up. My BIOS is in UEFI mode.</p>

<p>I have a Gigabyte G1 Sniper A88X, it has ""APU with integrated AMD Radeon™ HD 8000/7000"" and I read somewhere it has dual graphics technology. So I went to buy a Gigabyte Geforce GTX 960 2GB.</p>

<p>I plugged it into the PCI slot and I turned it on. The fan is moving and it seems to be working. I tried to plug my monitor in the DVI slot it had but the monitor did not find it. I plugged the DVI cable to the slot I used previous and it worked fine.</p>

<p>I never installed a GPU, but my friend said that a BIOS is supposed to come up at start up, that never happened. So I just did the next thing and put the CD in and it installed everything until it got to the NVidia Geforce Experience, it would not install for some reason. My solution was to run a driver update using the Device Manager found under My Computer/Properties and it finally recognized my card. Now however, is my problem.</p>

<p>I got the NVidia Geforce Experience to work but the driver update: Geforce Game Ready Driver, just seems to want to keep installing. I restarted my computer three times but it seems like its not working. Then under Device Manager/Display Adapters, I see the Radeon Integrated Graphics and the NVidia GTX 960, but the 960 has an error warning on it saying that ""Windows stopped this device because it found problems CODE 43"" I tried disabling the Radeon, didn't work. Now I am lost.
My computer recognizes the card but does that mean that it's working? I don't know. Can Someone please help?</p>

"1381595","How to statically identify sys files on which an application depends?","<p>To help with the migration of applications off of legacy operating systems (e.g. XP) I need to identify driver (sys) files on which an application relies in order to run. This needs to be done by inspecting an existing system with the application installed, without running the installer and without running the application.</p>

<p>Although not a perfect solution, an attempt has been made to identify out-of-box drivers (drivers added since installation of the operating system) since this will narrow the number of sys files to be considered. DISM API can return the Inbox status of a driver, but this requires Windows 7 and above.</p>

<p>So far a reliable solution has proved evasive on XP. It's possible that querying of NTFS timestamp metadata (e.g. Changed) will help identify sys files that have been added to the file system since the operating was installed. Even if successful, this only narrows the field of enquiry, it doesn't actually identify drivers on which an application depends.</p>

"1145769","WINDOWS 10 Pro does not see Second XEON CPU","<p>E5 2383 v3 CPU issues</p>

<p>I have dual E5-2620 v3 CPU's installed and working well. I recently purchased two used E5-2683 v3 CPU/s to increase my CORE count for 3D Architectural design. Upon installation of the 2683's the MB BIOS Posted both CPU's just fine. THe BIOS reported the presence of both Chips with TEMP and Voltage information. However, upon starting Windows 10 Pro, the ""System"" only reported a single CPU present. I ran CPU-Z, and HWINFO and both programs report same (one CPU). CPU-Z reported the core and thread count to be 12 and 24 when it should have been 14 /28 respectively. I tried swapping the CPU slots and the same reported.</p>

<p>My question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there something in the BIOS and or Windows I can do to say ""Reset"" so that both report as they do with the 2620's or are my findings indicative of a faulty CPU(s)? When I replaced the 2620's all is well again so I am at a loss.</p>

<p>I need your help. Please advise. I would be happy to call and discuss with someone that has more expertise than me. I need to make a decision to try something else or return the CPU's for refund.  MORE DETAILSI am running an ASUS Z10PE-D8 WS board. I did swap the CPU's in opposite slots one and two and received the same reports in both POST and BIOS. The CPU's appear to be powering up (although one is running hotter than the other) but BOOT UP is fine. It's INSIDE Windows 10 Pro things go south. Are you suggesting that I install only one CPU at a time and see what happens after boot up? Ok. </p>

<p>What do you make of CPU-Z only showing 12 Cores and not 14 Cores (Spec for this CPU)? Also, Here is what the supplier suggested I try.</p>

<p>We tested it on ASUS Z10PA-D8 WS..With bios 3202. (I am Running 3304, they also claim their CPU-Z show the same MB as mine yet say they can only use one cpu slot. sounds odd to me.</p>

<p>Here are some tips,which make you confirm the processor works or not.</p>

<ol>
<li>Motherboard need be protected.They will protect itself and shut down auto when you install CPU with incorrect operation or other wrong action.</li>
<li>CPU Fans works well or not? CPU is installed properly or not?</li>
<li>Is the power enough for electricity supply?If not,it will shut down too.</li>
<li>Are all power lines properly connected or not?</li>
<li>If you test and run it in computer case or other cases,it will be more likely to lead to short-circuit.You can try to test it without case.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additional Instructions from Supplier.
There have two situations you may encounter when receive the them: the system automatic shutdown or the item cannot be lightened. Therefore, we give you a brief introduction about how to use it correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't touch the metal surface of the CPU, in case of electrical shock and circuit.</li>
<li>When install the CPU on the motherboard, you need to notice the CPU’s direction of the needle, don't put in the opposite direction.(There are four corners on the surface of CPU, one of the angle has a triangle symbol---the same as CPU seat of the motherboard .)</li>
<li>The installation process must be smooth and flat, and confirm the CPU with the CPU seat can connect smoothly.</li>
<li>Press down the CPU with your hand, and fix the CPU well into the CPU seat.</li>
<li>When install the CPU fans, you need to ensure the fans strength evenly with every four corners.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>When you encounter the CPU runs Automatic Power Off and the time gets shorter and shorter, there is no doubt that something wrong with your CPU fan’s cooling equipment, for example,</p>

<ol>
<li>CPU do not coating thermal paste.</li>
<li>CPU radiator power cord is unconnected or connection error.(Haven’t connected with the motherboard logo likes CPU FAN1 or CPU FAN2.)</li>
<li>CPU fans was broken , they do not run or low rotating speed.</li>
<li>If you have more platform(PC), we suggest you test the CPU directly on another test platform.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>You have installed properly, but the CPU still unable to lighten. Please pay more attention, it must be properly installed but unable to lighten. In this situation, we can provide you solution as following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the CPU first, and use eraser to wipe the metal surface, and you would know whether it has circuit or not. </li>
<li>Try to insert and withdraw the memory. Memory kit will occur poor connection , you may need to discharge or insert and pluck the memory to solve this problem.</li>
<li>Cleared out COMS(All the motherboard has a battery, this is motherboard’s COMS),there has a jumper wire on the edge of COMS. You can try to use the jump line to clear out the COMS and discharge the motherboard;</li>
<li>Reinsert and pluck the electric source to supply power and connect pin for motherboard, such as 24P or 28P socket, you can withdraw and install it again, and CPU power supply socket (4P or 8P interface) can also play an important role in the discharge.</li>
<li>Try again to install the CPU properly.</li>
</ol></li>

I get it that SSD is faster than HDD, etc. But what makes me wonder is: apparently USB can write <code>40MB/s</code>, HDD can read <code>20MB/s</code>, so why does HDD to USB write only <code>8MB/s</code>?</p>

"1038707","NSlookup of static IP showing computer name from DHCP range","<p>I am part of a network with 60 or so maximum devices. Just a class C subnet where x.x.x.1-100 are statically addressed hardware. 101-150 are also statically assigned addresses for thinclients and 'kiosks'. 151+ is the DHCP range for office laptops.</p>

<p>I am trying to 'map' the computers remotely rather than checking each IP on the floor. I did a <code>broadcast ping</code> and <code>arp -a</code> in hopes to grab all connected devices and started to nslookup the list to match computer names with IP's. </p>

<p>THE PROBLEM: <code>nslookup x.x.x.114</code> returned a computer name that should be in the DHCP range(151+). When I checked that computer's address it showed x.x.x.161, where it should be. I have done a <code>/flushdns</code> and <code>/registerdns</code> with no change.  <strong>Edit:</strong> I have seen incorrect/conflicting nslookups on the network before where <code>nslookup 'address'</code> returns a name and <code>nslookup 'name'</code> returns a different address.  I know NS can be do weird things but this specific static vs dynamic was not something I expected to see.</p>

<p>TLDR: Why would nslookup x.x.x.114 show the name of a computer in a DHCP range when the named computer has always been assigned through DHCP to another range?</p>

<p><strong>Edit more info</strong>: Not sure if this question will have an answer but here is another finding.  113 is returning a 'windows-phone' with nslookup and Advanced IP scanner.  114 is still showing the DHCP computer.  I found the computers with 113 and 114 and they have been at those addresses for at least 6 months.</p>

<p>All starts when Comodo antivirus gives me a virus alert about  <strong>SQLite3Wrapper.dll</strong> and ask me to place it on quarantine. I say ok, lets place it on quarantine and check it out. So far so good. After I double check that this was a false alarm, I ask comodo to restore the file and here is my first fail because windows 10 did not let it write it back to their place. And after that all my tries fails…  </p>

<p>First I take the ownership of the directory and give permission to administrator and my left for full access. Also disable all antivirus from comodo and windows.</p>

<ol>
<li>So after giving permission I try to copy but also fail.</li>
<li>I start windows <strong>in safe mode</strong> but did not let me copy the file back</li>
<li>I start windows <strong>in command mode</strong> but did not let me copy the file back</li>
<li>I start windows with <strong>MsDart</strong> latest version but this is also don’t let me copy the file. This is the strangest because MsDart supposedly runs over the windows and never have this issue on older versions of windows.</li>
<li>Then I try to restore the file using acronis backup that I have some days ago. Acronis also fail to write to that directory – did not ask to restore it on boot because I can not ask that from acronis, acronis did not recognize that can not write to that directory so is stack there for ever… </li>
<li>I have try to copy it with explorer and with total commander and with simple command promt</li>
<li>Also using Hyper-X and windows 10, I make more test and tries to copy a file on any of that directories but fail.</li>
<li><p>Also checking the effecting access windows says that I can write on there</p>

"1383171","C:\Windows.old has a phantom permission, how do I rid myself of it?","<p>I just used Clean Install to reinstall on Windows 10 1809 (big mistake, I know). It's the official refreshed version, but it grants <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code> permission to <code>C:\Windows.old</code>.</p>

<p>This is relevant because inheritance is sticking to all of the files, even in server mode. Any attempt to remove it looks as though it succeeds, but nothing happens.</p>

<p>These are all of my personal files and documents, appdata, etc, going back many years, so the relevant portion is about 200GB, so copying (which resets the modified date anyway) isn't really feasible.</p>

<p>I need to either</p>

<ul>
<li>move the files and break the inheritance chain; tried this using old PowerShell trick (move file, reset inheritance via <code>SetAccessRuleProtection</code>; the phantom permission sticks from ""Parent Object"" which this normally negates),</li>
<li>remove the phantom permission before moving files.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've already taken ownership of the folder, that's not helping any. To be clear, I want to <strong>remove</strong> the <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code> permission from <code>C:\Windows.old</code> so my files aren't tainted with a bad security permission.</p>

"1146945","Awful Battery Life After Windows 10 Anniversary Update","<p>I am running Windows 10 on a 6 month old Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 460.</p>

<p>I started to notice that I was originally getting about ~6-9 hours of battery life using painting and lite graphics apps, Chrome Browser with a bunch of tabs open.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden, my battery life went down to about 2 or 3 hours max. I did a battery report, and confirmed that this drop happened over a span of a few days. I cannot trace back this drop to any installed program within this time frame.</p>

<p>I installed battery bar, and saw that my battery had abnormal wear (21%), and then got the battery replaced the other day, however, I am still only getting 5 hours maximum with the most strict battery settings possible.</p>

<p>What I have done to diagnose the problem thus far:
- Turn on windows 10 battery saving mode
- Make sure I am on Battery Saving profile
- Close all background taskbar-apps (bottom right corner)
- Close all background toolbar-apps (main taskbar)</p>

<p>But I am still not getting the desired battery life...</p>

<p>Just to be clear, with no apps running, and screen brightness on about 50%, I used to easily be able to get 9 hours. Now I can get 3 if I am lucky. </p>

<p>I am guessing there is some background service or corrupted driver that is taking up CPU usage in the background. How would I go about diagnosing this other than trying to watch it bounce around in the Task Manager profiler?</p>

<p>It seems that the built-in windows 10 battery usage by app is quite useless in terms of finding this issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> </p>

<p>I will try a <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""clean boot""</a> in Windows to see if that helps, and report back. Might be tedious, but it's better than reformatting...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>It's very possible that a program called Prey was the culprit. After reading some forums, many users got huge increases from uninstalling this program. 
My CPU usage went from 35+% down to 7-10%. Not sure how much will impact the battery, but it will definitely help.</p>

<p>Also, it is worthwhile to note that with the 'advanced settings' of the windows battery profile configuration (accessible by right clicking the battery icon in the taskbar), there is an option to limit the max CPU usage when on battery. This is hacky though, and would only be done if all else fails... Plus it will slow down your computer.</p>

"1146952","How to disable the system drive paging file completely and still get dumps","<p>Windows 7 Ultimate</p>

<p>I've been using the minimum paging file size on my system drive needed for mini dumps, but I have found that some things, like Hulu and YouTube caching still use it ALOT and it rarely ever jumps out to my main larger paging file on a different physical drive, unless I'm playing a game or have alot of things open.  The problem is I have an SSD for my system drive and I heard that having a paging file on an SSD THRASHES them.  So, I moved my dump files to the same drive as my main paging file.</p>

<p>Now, am I right in thinking disabling the system drive's paging file COMPLETELY, I'll still get dumps because I moved the dump file loations?  Will windows still automatically set up that temporary paging file on the system drive anyway (the size of the ram), and if it does, does it ONLY use it for dumps?  Or will it still be pounding my SSD?</p>

<p><strong>My goal is to completely eliminate the paging file on my system drive and still get full dumps on another drive, without the wear on my main system drive which is an SSD.</strong></p>

<p>Oh and I've read many similar questions here but none exactly like what I need, so please don't just start throwing ""Duplicate!"" and links at me, this is a combination of a few of the other questions I've seen here, but If I missed this specific one, please tell me of course!</p>

<p>I successfully installed Ubuntu and after few minutes of using it, the image froze and I tried to restart the machine. After I restarted the machine I noticed that my OS won't boot any more, so I tried to manually select it in the Boot Menu. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I received these errors : </p>

<pre><code>Windows Boot Manager boot failed
Windows Boot Manager boot failed
Ubuntu boot failed
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so I started searching different solutions on the internet and I also tried a few things :</p>

<ul>
<li>I tried to repair my laptop using the Windows 8 installer, I selected Troubleshoot Menu, and I selected ""Refresh your pc"", and I receive this : <code>The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again</code>. After that, I selected ""Reset your pc"" and I received this : <code>Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing.</code></li>
<li>After these try-outs, I decided to check if I can make a new installation of Windows, and I cant, it says : <code>We couldn't find any drives. To get a storage driver, click Load driver</code>. So now I thought that it may be a problem with my hard-disk, I thought that my laptop wouldn't recognize it or something like that, so I accessed the command prompt and I used the command list disk, and it shows me just the size of the USB on which I have my windows installation, no other disks. After that I checked if my hard disk is being recognized in BIOS and it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried to use the automatic repair from the troubleshoot -> advanced tab, and now I can't access the Windows 8 installer because I receive this error : </p>

<pre><code>Recovery, your pc needs to be repaired. 
The Boot Configuration Data file doesn't contain valid information for an operating system.

Does anyone know how to approach this problem?
EDIT : I tried all methods from repair, including automatic repair. The thing is that when i plug in my usb with the windows 8 installer on it, if I go to repair-&gt;advanced-&gt;command prompt and I try to do a chkdsk or a list disk it shows me just the size of my USB, no other disk is found, I ran few commands for checking my disk and building a boot enviroment but it's still not working, the windows installer isn't detecting my hard disk.

It involves downloading 13 different patches, and it says you have to reboot after installing each patch.</p>

<p>I imagine that each patch will prompt you to reboot Windows after it is installed, but do you really need to reboot between each patch?</p>

<p>Could I just install all 13 patches (from oldest to most recent), and then reboot just one time at the end?  Or does Windows put on lock on the patched files, so that if I tried to install a subsequent patch without rebooting, it would fail?</p>

  <p>10th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1 Processor (6MB Cache, up to 3.6 GHz)</p>

<p>The laptop has arrived and im setting it up, under the system information dialog in W10 it reports the following : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1 CPU @ 1.00GHz, 1190 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I understanding this correctly ? Is this saying that i ordered a laptop with a CPU of upto 3.6Ghz (which i presumed would be a standard clock speed of c. 3 GHz) but they have shipped me a laptop with only a 1Ghz CPU ? </p>

<p>Although the Dell website didnt state the actual clockspeed of the CPU i presumed it would be c. 10-20% lower than the stated boost speed, as it has been on manly laptops and desktops ive owned in the past.</p>

<p>Does this mean that my new laptop will be slow ? </p>

<p>Am i focusing on the wrong metric here (eg. clockspeed) should i run a Geekbench test instead to get a better understanding, of this machine at its CPU.</p>

"1041567","Scripts for /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ to handle resolvconf -u","<p>There are two ways for <code>networkmanager</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>update <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code></li>
<li>do not update <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> at all</li>
</ul>

<p>Both solutions are not suitable at my side as at my side I need <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> to be handled by <code>resolvconf</code>, such that it can be regenerated any time with <code>resolvconf -u</code>.</p>

<p>What I would need are scripts for <code>/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/</code> which correctly work together with <code>resolvconf</code>.</p>

<p>However I was not able to find suitable scripts for what I think it is a pretty basic standard case.</p>

<p>So is there any standard solution for that (please provide essential part of the scripts here) or does everybody really need to re-invent the wheel each time?</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>There apparently is something, but this seems not to work correctly.</p>

<p>In my case I have <code>dnsmasq</code>, VPN and more, all fiddling with the DNS.</p>

<p>However <code>resolvconf -u</code> does not regenerate <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> correctly, so the default setting apparently lacks something.</p>

<p>To be more elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01ifupdown</code> calls <code>run-parts /etc/network/if-up.d</code></li>
<li><code>/etc/network/if-up.d/000resolvconf</code> then examines <code>$IF_DNS_NAMESERVER</code> and <code>$IF_DNS_NAMESERVERS</code> but <code>networkmanager</code> does not provide those and sets <code>IP4_NAMESERVERS</code> instead (according to manual)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence there somewhere is a missing link.  Here is a copy of what is found in <code>/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01ifupdown</code>:</p>

<p>A few months ago the monitor for my Acer Aspire F5-573 laptop shattered, so I took it to get fixed. Ever since then, the computer has said ""no battery detected"". I finally got fed up with its inability to operate without a power chord, so I looked up how to fix it. I followed all the instructions, up to where it said ""take out the battery"". I was alarmed to find that there was no battery installed, so my conclusion was that during the repair of my laptop, the battery was removed, and someone forgot to replace it.</p>

<p>Anyway, the store is no longer in business (conveniently), so I need to buy a new battery myself. All the instructions online for identifying what type of battery to buy tell you to look at the labels on your current one, but as you can probably guess, I'm not able to do that without actually having a battery to look at. Is there any way to tell what type of battery I need to buy without looking at the current one?</p>

A few hours later, I got a BSOD while doing quite nothing (viewing some images using Firefox).

"1148837","Duplicating C:\ drive hidden from Windows XP in Windows 10","<p>When I installed a stock copy of Windows XP on an older computer of mine recently (which eventually got replaced with Ubuntu because of driver and security reasons), I noticed something that really stood out to me. It was that when I typed C:\ into the address bar of Windows Explorer, it didn't show me any files. Instead, it showed me a notice that the folder was hidden and that modifying its contents would lead to trouble. I rarely if ever have to actually modify the C:\ drive unless I'm poking around where I'm not supposed to (and things more often than not break when I do that), and the feature just seemed correct for most purposes and users. I am looking for a way to duplicate this in Windows 10.</p>

<p>Clarification: I do not want the entire drive hidden, just the parts of it that shouldn't normally be visible to a user.</p>

<p>I tried hiding it like any other file/folder, opening up the Properties window, etc. but the check box was not there. I do not know if hiding a folder also hides everything under it, which would prevent the other obvious-ish option I thought of.</p>

"1254051","Kali Linux Live USB (with Persistence) Boots To Blinking Cursor After Unknown Filesystem","<p>I am aware that many people have this problem, but none of them seem to have the same details as me. I am attempting to create a live USB with persistance for Kali Linux (32-bit). I have followed the necessary steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Installed the ISO file from kali.org<br></li>
<li>Verified the sha256sum of the ISO file<br></li>
<li>Used GParted to format my drive to FAT32<br></li>
<li>Used GParted to create a persistence (ext4) partition<br></li>
<li>Used <code>sudo dd if=/home/arctic_hen7/Downloads/kali-linux-2017.2-i386.iso of=/dev/sdb1 bs=4M
</code> to extract the contents of the ISO file to my USB<br></li>
</ol>

<p>This is when I noticed that after I went back into GParted to close it, the filesystem of the Kali Live partition (not the persistance) had become unknown (and a red exclamation mark sign appeared next to the partition name). Also, when I went into the persistence partition from Nautilus, it had a lost+found directory. I tried booting it like this (after adjusting my BIOS settings), but I was presented with a black screen and a flashing white underscore cursor in the top-left corner of the screen. I waited, but it did not boot. I then booted back into Ubuntu and tried the whole process again (but with the same ISO file), but I also deleted the lost+found directory in the persistance partition. I tried booting but was met with the same issue. My system specifications:</p>

<p>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (alongside Windows Vista (which I never use))<br>
Vaio VGN-Z46GD (quite old)<br>
Intel Centrino 2<br>
Insyde H2O BIOS<br></p>

<p>I love this theme I've created, and I'd like for these darker windows 7 frames to be used as a replacement to the Chromium/Chrome windows.</p>

<p>I think chromium is great, I love using it and I've tried alternatives (Opera, IE) both of these browsers have their own issues </p>

<p>(stuttering &amp; slow in comparison to chromium OR limited to zero customization without sacrificing some modern functionality.) </p>

<p>Opera 12 is the best solution I found and I guess it does exactly what I want boy does it lag... hard. </p>

<p>However, both of those browsers DO extend the basic windows 7 frames.
(the frames that every other explorer application uses, excluding things like Microsoft Office, Photoshop or Visual Studio which use their own custom frames)</p>

<p>I was wondering if there was ANY WAY AT ALL to somehow disable the Chromium/Chrome custom frames in favor of the default Windows 7 frames used by all other applications.</p>

<p>Also, bonus question, is there any way to get H.2XX video (HTML 5) to work with Chromium?</p>

<p>In comparison, a damaged hard drive, may be drilled to further reduce the chances of sensitive data being read once acquired by another person.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is it possible to erase its contents by just using a hammer to smash the flash chips inside it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this a rhetorical question? If you physically destroy the drive including the chips, it doesn't make any difference whether there is still data stored on the pieces since there is no way to access it. — fixer1234</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A clarification on the question due to @fixer1234's comment:</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
If there would be someone with a technical expertise, who can acquire a thrown drive and re-power the drive in some other way. For instance, if the ports were the only part damaged in the drive, and if it were replaced and re-soldered by the one who acquired the drive, would it be safer, to just smash the chips for it to be unreadable at all?</p>

<p>Or is the chips too durable, that the data can still be present despite by applying physical force to it, such as a hammer.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I am using a hammer in this scenario, as it is the one of the most possible item to exist in a common household.</p>

"1255909","How to Create a Windows Task that activates on event in Powershell","<p>Hey I need to create a windows task that acts much like the Logoff Scripts in Group Policy (our environment does not have AD) do. The task needs to run as the logged in user so that the script can output the name of the user running it into a .csv that tracks user logoff/login times and dates. I'm not sure that powershell is the absolute best way to do this but I need to be able to author task as an admin but set the user to run the script as the currently logged in user, whoever that might be at the time. This will be deployed to several hundred machines.</p>

<p>If there's another way to track user logoff I would be very much so interested in that method whether it involves powershell or not. Previously I've tried making the scripts run by editing the registry to attempt to set Logoff scripts in GP but that seemed to be more complex that I had initially expected. Zenworks was another option but it only ran the scripts AFTER the user had logged out which cause the script to output incorrect results into the .csv.</p>

"1553882","How to move users' data from a separate partition on one drive to another drive and remove the original users' data partition?","<p>Simplifying, my old drive has four partitions; we are going to speak about first two (which ""belong"" to Windows; the remaining two ""belong"" to Linux). Let's call the first two partitions C: and D:; they are NTFS. Partition C: contains the Windows 10 system and programs, and D: contains users' data in users' folders: we have directories D:\Jack, D:\Jane, D:\Sally, and subdirectories D:\Jack\Downloads, D:\Jack\Documents, D:\Jack\Favorites, ... that I could move easily to D: by changing the location of the corresponding subdirs of C:\Users in file properties.  Hidden, system, and admin subdirectories and files in C:\Users stay where they originally were (namely, in C:\Users).</p>

<p>The goal of moving was (and is) to store users' data separately from the system, programs, and auxiliary admin data.  Such a scheme eases backups, reinstallation, recovery from crashes, etc.</p>

<p>Two years after moving, I ran out of space on both partitions. The current partition C: is 80% full, and the current partition D: won't hold a large chunk of external users' data that logically belongs there. Now I bought a new large drive that I'd like to use for the the users' data only (with hidden/system/admin files from old C:\Users or without -- I don't care). The old D: partition should be gone, the old C: partition should be extended to the space freed by deleting old D:, and the new D: partition should be on the new secondary drive and contain the data from the old D: partition (either exhibiting the same structure as now, i.e., with hidden/system/admin files still in C:\users, or containing all of %Users%; I don't care about the difference).</p>

<p>How do I accomplish this such that Windows 10 is still usable after the change and the users won't feel too much difference except more space?</p>

<p>As available tools, I have Debian live with gnome (so, I believe, linux tools could work) and a Windows 10 installation image.</p>

<p>Immediately after starting my computer, I have to restart it. Otherwise I will have the following issues.</p>

<p><strong>Things that break</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can no longer drag tabs out of Google Chrome, to create a separate instance</li>
<li>Playlists on Youtube will automatically rewind (go to the previous song) until the start of the playlist is reached. The tab/browser does not need to have focus (see next item)</li>
<li>Possibly the same issue as the item before this one: Playing a movie or song in VLC will cause it to restart permanently while the window has focus. Meaning I can watch a movie in VLC as long as I don't click the window</li>
<li>Scrolling is no longer possible anywhere. The scroll cursor appears and disappears instantly, as if I've pressed the scroll wheel twice. Interestingly enough I can used the ""tilt-scroll"" still (not pressing down on the scroll-wheel, but pushing it to the left/right)</li>
<li>Playing any type of media (on VLC or Youtube, etc.) will cause the audio control bar at the top left of my screen to appear (like when you increase/decrease the volume), and never goes away until I close all media-playing sources</li>
<li>I'm not sure when this happens so feel free to ignore it. Quite often I will not be able to use alt+tab to switch process. The current process will stay in the foreground</li>
<li>Maybe worth mentioning that I know that this problem exists as soon as I reach the login screen, because I can't use the spacebar to select my user as I usually do. My usual flow: Reach login screen -> press spacebar -> enter password field appears. Flow with this problem: Reach login screen -> press spacebar -> the ""select a user"" button has the touched/dirty state, but stays. I have to click the button instead.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things I've tried:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Installing new drivers</p></li>
<li><p>Unhooking all peripherals / switching them with other devices. I thought maybe audio control buttons got stuck as it could have caused some of the issues. (Keyboard, mouse, monitor, microphone)</p></li>
<li><p>Installing clean version of Windows 10</p></li>
<li><p>Unhooking/replacing hardware (HDDs &amp; new power supply)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've dealt with this issue for so long now that starting my computer twice has become part of my daily routine, but I'd like to fix it at some point. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>So </p>

<pre><code>A 1
B 2
C 0 
D 1 
E 2

<p>The answer here would be 2.. Because at C the count resets back to 0.</p>

<p>=> The value of -b:v is extracted from FFProbe to get better results if the machine supports GPU encoding</p>

<p>As far as I understand the problem: FFProbe returns only the avg bitrate wich is way to low.
I have tried to switch to -b:v, -maxrate:v, -bufsize:v with medium results. The videos are mutch better but still below the org file. even with the same bitrates like the org file.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a better way to convert all videos to baseline?</li>
<li>Is it still recommend to convert videos to baseline if its mandotory to support the majorety of devices (PC/Mac/Android/IPhone)?</li>

<p>My setup is as follows:</p>

<p>Router > managed switch > other devices.</p>

<p>in the category other devices I have a pc with two 1gbps nics and many other devices.</p>

<p>In the managed switch: VLAN ALL = Port1, VLAN 1 = Port2, VLAN 2 = Remaining ports</p>

<p>PC with 2 nics: NIC1=connected with Port2 managed switch NIC2=connected with Port3 managed switch</p>

<p>ROUTER: Connected with Port1 of managed switch</p>

<p>I tested this config useing a laptop and the laptop got a ip adress and I had internet but could not find any other devices in the network eventough they are in the same subnet. No problem this is what i want. But when it was plugged in a port which was in vlan2 it found all devices directly</p>

<p><strong>What am i trying to achieve?</strong></p>

<p>I want to use NIC1 of the pc for all LAN traffic by pulling all streams from all local devices over this NIC1. Then I want to use NIC2 for all other traffic and mainly wan traffic.</p>

<p>Is it possible with the configuration above? and is correct to have both VLAN1 and VLAN2 on the same subnet?</p>

<p>And last question, I was scared of it but it did not seem to happen. Because Port1 of the managed switch has VLAN: ALL I thought maybe all traffic then will go through that port and devices will be able to find eathother by communicating over the router but that also did not seem to happen? Or is that normal? or the reason is the following:</p>

<p>My internet provider sends internet over VLAN:34 and IPTV over VLAN:4....Could the router be in VLAN:34 which is the reason why there is no communication between VLAN1 and VLAN2 as the router as a middleware...</p>

<p>And everywhere, on forums and guides is is given that a vlan has it's own subnet or needs it but I did some tests successfully within the same subnet.Is this true?</p>

<p>But both VLAN1 and VLAN2 are in the same subnet 192.168.2.0/24</p>

<p>After a call to the manufacturer/Gemalto, the representative told me that I would be able to receive voice calls despite the card being data only. I insisted that I was meaning phone calls using <strong>the current phone number which belongs to the sim card which would be put inside the device and not skype or even sip techniques or something which involves changing the phone number</strong>. He repeated that this was possible without third party hardware. Without (me) understanding whether the card fully behaves like a plain network card.</p>
<p><strong>In theory, it should be possible to do what I want through software since the sim card and the device performs the required authentication on mobile networks already</strong> since it has to be done only one time for both voice and data.<br />
Or maybe the reason is since Volte or Vonr is completely ip‑based that it can be done without hardware after all (I’ve no idea)…</p>
<p>Having never used a hardware phone before, I don’t have a real idea on what to do even in the case the card would support things like volte or csfb or vonr other than Windows would provide what’s needed without further configuration and that I should be able to configure Asterisk on other systems (as a sip gateway to the card not as a standalone server).</p>

When the defragmenter is running on a small laptop, it is almost impossible to get work done on the computer. Even clicking a menu may be delayed by many seconds. Video cannot be played.</p>

<p>There must be some way to turn off automatic defragmentation, or to make it happen at the user's desired times. Anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>ADDED: Perhaps the slowdown is not caused by defragmentation, but by other tasks done during automatic maintenance. I have found neither explanation nor settings.</p>

<p>If I had designed Windows, I would have made sure that the message pump could never be dominated by an I/O operation, or by a task that refused to yield their control. At the very least, defragmentation should deliberately yield control several times a second, so it does not hog the computer and make it hang or run very slowly.</p>

<p>ADDED: Since disabling defragmentation, I have observed the same kind of severe slowdown at random times, most often when I wake the system from sleep in the morning. This would appear to prove that my assumption that defragmentation is the culprit is false. I have re-enabled defragmentation.</p>

<p>However, this leaves open the question of why regular maintenance is slowing the system down so severely. In its usual benevolent hiding of details from users, Microsoft's task scheduler gives no hints as to what tasks or process names are part of its scheduled regular maintenance. It would seem difficult to do further research to figure out why this severe slowdown happens, a few times a day.</p>

"1392595","Computer Randomly Restarts no BSOD or error (Custom PC Build)","<p>So I have a rather weird error, I just finished building a desktop made from custom picked parts (listed below). The installation process and everything went fine but when I started to install programs and actually use the desktop it randomly crashes and restarts.</p>

<p><strong>The issue:</strong> Both my monitors will lose connection to the desktop at the exact same time, BUT all the LED lights (a lot of them) in the case don't even flicker. The fans (6 of them don't change or make any noise difference). After the monitors disconnected for about 10-15seconds the entire system will restart and boot into Windows 10 again (sometimes it will crash as soon as it starts and do a loop for a few times).</p>

<p>In the event the loop continues I have to turn off the switch to the PSU on the back and then flip it on to get it to start without crashing.</p>

<p><em>The main part I have a hard time understanding, is that it is completely random. I can't figure out what triggers it. It could happen 10 seconds after I boot or it could go ~4 hours of gaming without an issue</em></p>

<p>Things I think might be an issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first thing I thought was that it was a PSU issue, but I don't believe it is due to the fact that no lights, no fans, nothing at all seems to indicate that it is a loss of power to the rest of the system. Even if it is a surge, every other part of the computer that uses electricity would be affected? And certainly not enough to cause the system to reset?</li>
<li>Overheating CPU. I thought this was the case but normally a CPU would need to reach around 70-80deg Celsius for that to happen. This crash often occurs when there is no load at all on the CPU, and it didn't happen while gaming and running 3D modeling software (CREO Parametic). I also installed a CPU temp monitor (CPU-Z) and it doesn't really spike to unstable temperatures. (I don't actually know the BOIS CPU temp cutoff, but if it does cutoff wouldn't the machine power down not do an actual restart?</li>
<li>Maybe somehow the reset button is glitched? It doesn't seem that I am able to hold the power button down to kill all power to the board (have to manually flip the PSU) when it is in its weird restart loop state. And a reset seems like what is happening, it is reseting what is on my computer and causing a restart (maybe why I have the endless loop). I am pretty sure that I wired all the pins correctly according to the motherboard manual and the desktop case manual.</li>
<li>Another thing I thought it could be was the RAM. When I first installed it, they were clocked in the BIOS at 2133Mhz (rated at 3200Mhz). So I changed the rating to the 3200Mhz value and started it (problem persists at random). I thought maybe I needed to up the voltage to the RAM so I changed the DRAM Voltage from 1.2V (Stock) to 1.35V. After that I played some video games for a ~4 hours with no issue, went to bed, turned it on the next day and then it instantly restarted. I also tried to look at the timings and stuff in the BIOS, I thought maybe that a setting was off but every single thing seemed accurate.</li>

<li>AMD Radeon R7 370 (Scrapped from old computer, no issues at all)</li>
<li>Windows 10</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible Solutions I might try?</p>

<ul>
<li>One possible solution if it is indeed the memory is to replace it with DDR3 sticks from my old build. If I can go a few days without any issues I think it would be safe to say that it is the memory?</li>
<li>Run memtest on the ram sticks to determine if it is bad?</li>
<li>Unplug and replug in all of the cables within the desktop</li>
<li>Swap out my brand new 750PSU with my old EVGA 850W PSU</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to avoid having to disassemble the entire computer (I'm hoping it really is just a BIOS setting or bad memory). I also attached below a picture of the Windows 10 event viewer with the critical errors, each time this occurred it is labeled as a ""Kernel-Power"" issue.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, I found a bunch of other posts with similar issues but none have a valid resolution (except one who returned everything and build a new computer). I do have a PSU (750W) which is strong enough to power the entire system, I have adequate air flow with the fans to ensure air is blowing in and out, and I am at a complete loss as I don't even know how to create it.</p>

<p>P.S. While writing this post every 30 sec I copied to a sticky note to save it just in case it crashed, so far it has been up for about ~ 38min without an issue (after it did its restart cycle on first power up).</p>

<p>EDIT: When looking at the supported memory for my Motherboard (<a href=""https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/SocketAM4/PRIME_X470-PRO/PRIME-X470-PRO-Memory-QVL-Ryzen-Radeon-Vega_Graphics.pdf?_ga=2.95208923.614721832.1547154730-1088761089.1547154730"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/SocketAM4/PRIME_X470-PRO/PRIME-X470-PRO-Memory-QVL-Ryzen-Radeon-Vega_Graphics.pdf?_ga=2.95208923.614721832.1547154730-1088761089.1547154730</a>), I noticed that it didn't have the exact version of my RAM which is CMK16GX4M2B3200C16. Would that be an issue? </p>

<pre><code>$ cat /etc/sysconfig/ntpd

<p>My local refclock NTP server seems to be doing the job to some degree, because the system log says:</p>

 1. Change settings in Bitcoin Core. As said above, no luck so far.
 2. Bitcoin Core through Tor. Is this even possible? Does this solve the port issue?
 3. Port-forward in Ubuntu via Firewall (gufw?). Again, I don’t know how to do this.</p>

"1155354","Why am I having WiFi troubles?","<p>I have spent literally the entire day trying to figure out why the WiFi was failing. At first it was just one laptop which had trouble connecting, staying connected etc.</p>

<p>Eventually it led me to renaming the WiFi, giving it a new password, making all devices forget the old one, effectively starting fresh. Now it connects, but while the devices stay connected the wifi is ridiculously slow regardless of the time of day and proximity to the router, and internet access constantly drops out. Wired connections work as well as they possibly can, but the WiFi is so slow.</p>

<p>So I suspected the WiFi has something wrong with it to make all the devices slow, BUT, it's only slow on two of the 3 laptops, the fasted being the only one with an Ethernet port. I ran a speed test and on the 2 slow laptops, one started the test but couldn't finish and the other couldn't even start. The one that I have been plugging the Ethernet cable into runs anywhere from 10/15mbps which is pretty much normal for my place.</p>

<p>Keep in mind all speed tests were done using WiFi only. The only other thing I could think to do was change the channel, and make sure i wasn't using the same one as anyone around me to avoid interference and congestion, but it did nothing.</p>

<p>So my question is, why on two laptops is the WiFi so bad, and why across all devices does it drop out, lose internet and run slow? I have reset all network adaptors on all devices, flushed the DNS in command prompt, tried disabling all antivirus and changed the WiFi channel to no avail. I'm at my wits end here and I would really appreciate some help. </p>

<p>Best performing laptop is a HP, the other two are lenovo. I'm trying to connect to a netgear and before you say it, no I cant try connecting straight to the modem because I have a router/modem combo.</p>

and I wonder if I can do this with only one GPU and my onboard GPU?</p>
<p>E.g. I start Arch with my onboard GPU with the DVI to my main monitor where I can configure everything and so on. Then I start Windows with my GTX 760 and do something in it. When it's still running I turn of the GPU pass trough for windows, start Ubuntu and turn the GPU pass trough on for it. If I switch back to windows I switch the GPU support back to windows.</p>
<p>Is that possible? Or is it necessary to have 2 GPUs?</p>

"1558496","How do redundant memory cells in DRAM raise yield?","<p>I was recently reading Computer Architecture-A Quantitative Approach(6th edition), and I encountered a problem while trying to understand a section from page 34:</p>

<pre><code>Given the tremendous price pressures on commodity products such as DRAM and SRAM, designers 
have included redundancy as a way to raise yield. For a number of years, DRAMs have regularly
included some redundant memory cells so that a certain number of flaws can be accommodated. 
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't yield actually refer to the number of DRAMs (out of many DRAMs manufactured in bulk) that make through the testing-procedure? If it is the case, how does adding redundant memory cells to a single DRAM increases that DRAM's yield chance. Furthermore, what are some examples of ""certain number of flaws"" that the line refers to.</p>

Solidworks is supposed to be fully compatible with Windows 10 AFAIK. I wonder if I should format my ssd and do a clean installation of Windows; but it's also true that my operating system is fast except than while running Solidworks.

<ul>
<li>quad core mini pc (rikomagic v5)</li>
<li>custom android app using an android webview to show a website</li>
<li>rather old non working dell monitor supporting hdmi</li>
<li>working tv monitor surely supporting newer hdmi standards</li>
</ul>

<p>The story:</p>

<p>The mini pc is connected to a monitor via HDMI. The weird thing is that my Dell PC monitor causes a youtube video loaded in the webview to playback as either complete unviewable with only green artefacts on the whole screen or red and blue colors exchanged depending on the user agent i choose for the webview.
Whereas a colleague of mine told me that he tried the mini pc at home on his tv monitor and the video worked like a charm (without toying around with user agent - its working out of the box).</p>

<p>So i have a setup which is working depending on the hdmi monitor connected. I never thought much about hdmi, but my impression was, that the youtube website reads the encoded video from the server (e.g. some mp4 with h264 codec or such) and uses html5 (a software component) to view the video. So in the end i thought the video goes to maybe some hardware decoder on the mini pc or is done by plain software decoder.</p>

<p>At this point i thought the decoded video is merged into the mini pc graphics card buffer or such, and the result is streamed via hdmi to the monitor. Which means i thought that hdmi just receives by specification (which i dont know anything about) some video stream in a hdmi specific encoded format.</p>

<p>The question:</p>

<p>So my question is if its possible to send e.g. h264 directly via hdmi to a monitor and it just works, depending on the monitor surely. But is this possible? Or to ask it differently, how can it be that, the software side doesnt seem to work on an rather old Dell monitor but hdmi supported, but suddenly works on a new tv monitor also just connected via hdmi without touching the software at all? I thought that the devices connected to some kind of hdmi monitor need to be able to understand the needed video codecs and not the monitor itself which i thought is just stupid to playback some specification based stream.</p>

"1262079","Changing Screen Name on the Lockscreen or Sign-In Screen","<p><strong>Perhaps this edit will help anyone of you who can provide a solution better understand the problem I face.  Here is my edit (as of Thursday 26 Oct 17):</strong>
The problem I having involves something I did when managing the name of my computer.  If you look at the upper right portion of my computer screen, you'll find the small circle with a neutral picture silhouette.  Just to the immediate left of that silhouette is a label I changed to identify my name (which it was originally) to another name I gave my computer.  Why I did this?  Well, I guess I was just experimenting with the field to control this label.  Now, I cannot change the label back to what it was originally.  And I don't know how to do this?  Can you provide me with the answer to this dilemma?</p>

<p><strong>Below this line is what I originally wrote about this problem:</strong>
This process is confusing!  I am in my account settings under Your Info > My profile.  I was playing around (maybe shouldn't have done so) and wrote: ""If this ain't your computer then leave now or I'll send my phantoms after you.""  or something similar to that between [First Name] and [Last Name] fields.  When I went to start up my computer, I ran into some problems getting past the sign in screen. I'm trying to reverse what I did, and this has been a problem somewhat to me.</p>

<p>The UDF code executes, but the function return values (one is Text, one is Variant) are not displayed -- the previous value remain displayed in the cell.

However, the motherboard box states that the maximum is: 24GB as stated in the first paragraph of this post.  Is that correct? Is there another limitation that I am not aware of (my PC is 64 Bit Windows)? </p>

<p>Also, I currently have 6GB.  There are 6 slots.  Can I just buy a 4GB RAM module upgrading my PC to 10GB? I cannot do this because of the DIMM nature of the motherboard according to the vendor and I must buy two 4GB modules.  Why is that? </p>

<p>Finally what is meant by: 1600/1333/1066 in the first paragraph? Does this mean that the motherboard works at all these RAM speeds?</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>

<h2>   Microsoft has quietly fixed a software update it released last week,</h2>

<h2>    which effectively prevented Windows 10 users from connecting to the</h2>

<h2>    Internet or joining a local network.</h2>

<p>So Microsoft broke the DHCP client on Windows 10 computers.  But now they say they have a patch to fix it.</p>

<p>My question is:  How do you get the update if you can't get online?</p>

<p>Certainly, my 92 year old grandmother wouldn't know to set up static IP, for instance.  All she would know is that it quit connecting, suddenly.  She might not even try again for a week.  </p>

<p>-->  This is not a duplicate, because you can't renew an IP address if DHCP isn't functioning.  The non-technical user is simply stuck.  It simply cannot connect - it never gets an address or gateway.  </p>

"1158165","One way communication only","<p>I have connected my netgear r7000 to my existing home network as a second router and assigned the ip 192.168.2.1 to it while the main router has 192.168.1.1</p>

<p>Everything works fine, wifi, eth cables, etc.. The problem is : I have a server with ip 192.168.1.100 (connected via cable to the 192.168.1.1 router) and I can connect to it via SSH from another machine that is connected to the 192.168.2.1 router (with ip 192.168.2.115) but not the other way around. The other way around does not allow me to even ping the gateway 192.168.2.1.</p>

<p>From 192.168.1.100 I can ping 192.168.1.1 (main router) but not 192.168.2.1 (dd-wrt router).</p>

<p>On the 192.168.1.100 machine there is no firewall, I tried to narrow down and locate the issue by connecting another laptop from the exact same eth cable of the 192.168.1.100 machine, same issue : Cannot ping 192.168.2.1.</p>

<p>I than connect the same laptop physically to the 192.168.1.1 router still cannot ping the 192.168.2.1, thats why I presume that 99% of that the issue is somewhere related to the dd-wrt router.</p>

<p>To simplify :</p>

<pre><code>192.168.1.100 ping -&gt; 192.168.1.1 OK
192.168.1.100 ping -&gt; 192.168.2.1 No Response
192.168.1.1 ping -&gt; 192.168.2.1 No Reponse

192.168.2.115 SSH -&gt; 192.168.1.100 OK
192.168.1.100 SSH -&gt; 192.168.2.115 Connection timeout

192.168.1.1 = Main router
192.168.2.1 = dd-wrt router
192.168.2.115 = Machine 1
192.168.1.100 = Machine 2
</code></pre>

<p>I already tried to factory reset the 192.168.1.1 router, to change the netgear router range from 192.168.2.1 to 10.0.0.1, same issue :(</p>

<p>Also tried to tcpdump the eth interface while I try to ping to see if there is some message, nothing found.</p>

<p>The message I get from the ping itself (from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.2.1) is :</p>

<pre><code>    [root@server_centos7 ~]$ ping 192.168.2.1

    From 213.XXX.XXX.234 icmp_seq=142 Packet filtered
</code></pre>

<p>Where is this packet filtered coming from? The IP 213.XXX.XXX.234 is unknown to me. On the dd-wrt the firewall is disabled and I have no clue where else I can check. Is there perhaps a conf issue somewhere? Can somebody help me to figure this out?</p>

<p>The power supply (the 700W in an HP-Z440 workstation) has more than enough raw power, but the connectors are an issue.</p>

<p>It has these available power connectors:
- 2x 6-pin
- 2x SATA
- 1 4-pin (molex)</p>

<p>Theoretically, the 6-pin plus either the 4-pin molex or one of the SATAs should be wireable to the 8-pin, to give the required 150W.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of an available adapter to do this?</p>

<p>The 2x SATAs could be adapted to the 8-pin (there are standard adapters for this), but I'm unsure if the SATAs will actually carry enough power.</p>

<p>I could just use a 6-to-8 pin adapter (the guy at HP had just configured a system like that). It would probably run with the limited power draw, but would likely hamper it's performance, which is going to be undesirable for my needs.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: 2 other possible configurations, that use 2 adapters instead of 1.
1. 2x SATA -> adapter -> 6 pin on GPU, and 2x 6 pin -> adapter -> 8 pin on GPU.

<p>I should add this is not a hardware performance issue, as the laptop is quite new (i7@7500, 8GB RAM) and had been super fast until only relatively recently. I don't remember having installed any particularly demanding software or addons.</p>
<p>Nor is it an Internet connection issue, since for instance any content streamed through a browser I don't use (Edge), and/or with Windows started in safe mode, runs smoothly.</p>
<p>What I already tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring the Task Manager for executables/apps using up inordinate amounts of CPU or mem - nothing seems suspicious</li>
<li>System Restore (unfortunately this had been accidentally turned off, thus cannot use)</li>
<li>complete anti-virus check with updated definitions</li>
<li>restarting Windows in safe mode helps (PC runs smooth), however I have many installed programs and it'd be tedious to work down which components that auto-load are responsible for this sluggishness</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason why I need 2 duplicate Google Chrome is because 1 Chrome Application is just for the normal, whereas the other one will import my custom made extension and use it with KIOSK mode to force-redirect to a specific page.</p>

<p>So I know when the KIOSK mode is opened, I couldn't launch the normal Chrome as expected, even though it is possible, I also need to protect the extension being uninstall/disable.</p>

<p>Somehow, I only find this way to secure my custom made extension from being uninstall/disable and also I can create a chrome's shortcut to force-redirect to a specific page.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advanced information. Much appreciate.</p>

"1160476","My HDD is limited to FAT32, can't format NTFS (RAW)","<p>Update: my question has shifted a bit but I think it is still valid. It's just not limited to my drive, but my PC as a whole.</p>

<p>It seems my drive get bad sectors as Yorik pointed out, when I run them through any formatting software,  but CHKDSK won't fix them. </p>

<p>With a healthy drive you can choose to format it to whatever filesystem you want. Not in my case.</p>

<p>Preferably I'd like my partitions in NTFS file system, going with my Windows (I use Win10 Home x64 on a separate drive and volume with NTFS). 
FAT32 is not a valid option as it corrupts my data.</p>

<p>I've gone through hours of pain waiting doing low level formatting with <strong>GParted</strong>.
I've gone through with <strong>MS DiskPart</strong> ( commandwindows.com/diskpart.htm )  only to realise the drive and Volume simply won't format to NTFS file system (usually previewed as RAW in Disk Manager). 
I've started doing <strong>UBCD</strong> as suggested, I can't give up more <em>days</em> to this now. I need my PC for other stuff too...</p>

<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can blank my drives using any given method.</li>
<li>Everything seems fine until I run any formatting method and corrupts the given drive.</li>
<li>Simply formatting with MS DiskPart, Disk Manager or EaseUS from
whatever format to NTFS result in partition going RAW.</li>
<li>Formatting to FAT32 result in corrupting files placed on the drive.</li>
</ul>

I've tried to convert the Disk with ""convert E: /fs:ntfs"". As Keltari said.<br>
It gives the following output. (Would use pastebin here, not enough rep D: )</p>

"1161408","VirtualBox in limbo after deleting a VDI while in saved state","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I have a VM in 'saved' status, with 2 vdis, one of which has been deleted. Altough it was not mounted, now I can't start the VM, power off, nor remove the .vdi from the Storage tree. This setup is now in limbo. How can I fix the VM?</p>

<hr>

<p>I used to have 2 VMs. Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04. (The Host is Windows 8.1 64bits). I used to have the .vdi of each VM added as storage in the other VM, in order to easily mount &amp; zerofree &amp; compact (to release disk space back the Windows host). After I no longer needed the 14.04 VM, I deleted it, and removed the files.
When I did this, 16.04 VM was with 'Saved' status. So now when I try to start it I get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could not open the medium 'C:\Users\user\VirtualBox VMs\Ubuntu
  14.04.3\Ubuntu 14.04.3.vdi'. VD: error VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND opening image file 'C:\Users\user\VirtualBox VMs\Ubuntu 14.04.3\Ubuntu

</blockquote>

<p>If I go to the VM settings --> Storage, I cannot remove it because the status of the VM is 'saved' (cannot edit settings while on saved).</p>

<p>Going to File --> Virtual Media Manager --> selecting Ubuntu 14.04.3.vdi --> clicking release:</p>

<p>I also tried to edit Ubuntu 16.04.vbox file and change the uuid value (it appears in the file two times). Re-start Virtual Box.

<p>I found out the problem. As <strong>Máté Juhász</strong> and <strong>elserra</strong> pointed out it was due to rounding problem. The rounding problem occurred because i changed the number format from General to Number. I again went and typed 1.51 in to D1 and hence the result in F1 was obtained. I didnt check the actual value for D1 in the formula bar. i was checking rounding by changing the decimal value places. Thank you for your solution. </p>

<p>Here's a minimum reproducible case:</p>

<pre><code># Initial setup
mkdir /tmp/hgbug; cd /tmp/hgbug; hg init; 
touch README.md; hg add README.md
h commit -m ""initial commit""

# Bug - the echo command replaces a complex find command

# Actual Output
# 1a2b3c

# Expected Output
# 1a
# 2b
# 3c

<p>The interesting part is that mercurial doesn't collapse the lines when the output isn't piped or redirected.</p>

<pre><code>echo '1a\n2b\n3c\n' | xargs -I % hg log --template '%'
# Actual Output
# 1a
# 2b
# 3c
</code></pre>

<p>How do I prevent mercurial from collapsing lines when redirecting output?</p>

<p>To clarify, here's a more complete example comparing the output of <code>hg</code> with <code>echo</code> using both <code>xargs</code> and a <code>while</code> loop.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
cd /tmp/hgbug

echo '# hg log - xargs'
echo $'1a\n2b\n3c' | xargs -I {} hg log --template ""hg-{}"" | sort

echo
echo '# plain echo - xargs'
echo $'1a\n2b\n3c' | xargs -I {} echo ""echo-{}"" | sort

echo
echo '# hg log - while read'
echo $'1a\n2b\n3c' | while read -r file; do hg log --template ""hg-$file""; done | sort

echo
echo '# plain echo - while read'
echo $'1a\n2b\n3c' | while read -r file; do echo ""echo-$file""; done | sort

"1267936","how to modify my Logitech k810 special keys?","<p>I downloaded SetPoint and remapped the special keys on my Logitech K810 keyboard.  However, the ""my keyboard"" tab there is not found.</p>

<p>I Googled and tried to reinstall and restart several times, turned on and off, but nothing happens.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that I am using an external Bluetooth 4 USB because my PC doesn't have Bluetooth, so it is defined as a generic Human Interface Device keyboard.  All I need to do is to replace the special keys ""home and calculator"" with ""next/prev tracks"".</p>

<p>Is there a way to fix this, or other methods to modify these keys?</p>

I am facing a weird problem with internet connectivity on a RHEL 7 machine after creating network bonds.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>

bond0 => master, eth0 &amp; eth2 => slaves<br>
bond1 => master, eth1 &amp; eth3 => slaves</p>

<li>Restarting the network does not restore connectivity</li>
<li>Rebooting the machine does not restore connectivity.</li>

<p>I need to make a scatter plot, and the tables are too large to manually add each series to the chart.
Each position on the X table has the value Y and label on the same position in the tables Y and Label.</p>

<p>I need to plot a single serie, with all the X, Y and label data.</p>

<p>My plan is to turn the tables into three columns (a column each for X, Y, and label), using some Index function, and use the chart feature in the classic way.</p>

<p>But is there a simpler/more practical solution?</p>

"1269729","Get the best program support on Windows XP","<p>My primary system is Ubuntu but I need to run some Windows programs that cannot be run on Wine. Given that Windows XP is very light-weight and can be downloaded (almost) legally, I want to get the most out of it. The problem is that most programs have already dropped support for XP and refuse to even install. Is there a way to disguise it as eg. Windows 7? The minimum would be changing the ""header"" of the OS, so that applications would think it's actually Win7. But if it was possible install some fancy 3rd-party updates to maximize app support, or even replace some dlls with their Windows 7 version, it would be much cooler.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I tried changing the entries in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14648796/currentversion-value-in-registry-for-each-windows-operating-system""><code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion</code></a> but Windows Installer is not that easy to fool.</p>

<p>I own a legal copy of Windows 7, so I can use some files from there. This question is supposed to be more of a proof-of-concept. Of course I can install Win7 to VirtualBox (and probably will). But I'm searching for something light-weight that could run more apps than Wine. And of course hoping to get a deeper understanding of how Windows XP works.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your advice!</p>

<p>Note: If this smells ""opinion-based"" to you, stick with the ""change header"" part of this question :)<br>
But I guess it's not opinion-based because there are not gonna be more ways to do it (if any).</p>

"1164292","Shrinkage of free disk space (Windows XP)","<p>Before you tell me I should change the system, I tell you that my laptop has CPU Pentium Dual Core 2GHz and 2GB RAM, so I don't think newer version of Windows than XP will work on that (maybe 7, if I get one and use minimal settings), and installing Xubuntu or any other Linux distribution means all the games I have and like are going bye bye, probably forever. Not to mention ability of using scanners and printers...</p>

<p>Where free disk space in Windows XP dissapears? I use CCleaner on weekly basis and I recently compressed C:/WINDOWS/Installer (biggest disk space eater, according to WinDirStat) and I got finally 14% of free disk space - for a couple of days. Now again I have only 11% of free disk space and I have no idea why...<br>
Of course I could gain most of disk space by deleting C:/WINDOWS (biggest catalog on C disk), but I can't do that, for obvious reasons. My files take less than 10% of total used disk space. </p>

<p>Total disk C space - 39,06 GB, used - 34,53GB, free - 4,5GB. My Documents and Settings catalog takes 5,40 GB. CCleaner frees 500MB of disk space, at best. C:/WINDOWS - 12,3 GB.</p>

<p>the D partition has 193,8GB total, used 172,5 and free about 20GB. It doesn't contains system files, so it's easier to delete files there. All games are installed on D partition. Music I download (from jamendo and ektoplazm.com) and rip from bought CDs also goes there. 
Well, I can always save my files on D partiton (I already moved my photos there), but it hardly changes anything. </p>

<p>For a problematic directory, when I view its properties and go to the Security tab, I see</p>

<pre><code>(i) You must have Read permissions to view the properties of this object.
</code></pre>

<p>When I click on Advanced, I see:</p>

<pre><code> Owner: Unable to display current owner.

<p>Clicking on Change (as administrator) fails with:</p>

<pre><code>(i) You do not have permission to view or edit this object's permission settings.
</code></pre>

<p>Clicking on Continue from the Advanced dialog has the same result.</p>

<p>If I start a <code>cmd</code> shell as Administrator, I cannot <code>cd</code> into the directory. Nor can I delete it.</p>

<p>Initially, the directories in question were created when coding using the IntelliJ IDE. That is, they are created by IntelliJ as sub-directories of the project root, typically several levels down. Shutting down the IDE does not help. Sunsequently the issue arose in a directory that was part of an un-zipped file completely unrelated to IntelliJ. So it seems it can occur anywhere.</p>

<p>A reboot has fixed occurrences so far, but this is getting really annoying. That is, after a reboot I can delete the problematic directory and get on with my work for a while. Then the issue will crop up again, typically with a different directory. As time went by, the period between occurrences decreased to the point I was rebooting every few minutes.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>PS: As noted above, this problem has only shown up today. First thing this morning, a large Windows 10 update was applied. I'm not sure if this is related but the timing is suspicious. That is, the problem has only occurred since the update.</p>

<p>I'd like that each time I double-click on it (i.e. opening it with my favorite text editor such as Notepad++ or Sublime), it <strong>first</strong> prompts for a password, and open the text editor then.<br>
And each time I do save (CTRL+S in the text editor), it saves without asking (with or without asking, I don't mind).</p>

<p>I'm looking for something totally <strong>transparently integrated</strong> in Windows 7, i.e. I don't want to have to run a batch file each time I read/write the file. Also I don't want to have to launch a plugin in the text editor each time I open the file.</p>

<p>Is there a file encryption solution that could be transparently integrated in Windows 7 / filesystem (without having to run a third party tool automatically).</p>

<p>Note: I've already tried EFS encryption but if I want that the file is not available without password after a reboot, I would have to remove / reenable the keys/certificates each time, so EFS is not an option. (too heavy to remove the certificates each time I want to close the file).</p>

<p>Because high quality worked just fine on YouTube a few weeks ago, the change wouldn't seem to be a technology issue.  I tried changing the User Agent string to indicate Windows 8, but that had no effect. So YouTube seems to be basing the limitation on some other way to determine the operating system.</p>

<p>Here is a good one for WORD 2016 power users. 6 pages in a document. Footers are all unlinked to accommodate different pages numbers on each page in the footer. For example, Page x of 6. However, there is other text in the footers that you want to be the same on every page and don't want to have to update every pages footer. Answer: Use the page X of Y feature for the page numbering and leave the footers linked. Hope this satisfies the moderator/sysadmins.</p>

In addition having a Child Domain reside in the DMZ is a good idea and also a bad idea. </p>

<p>I'm no stranger at all to how to set this servers and firewall rules up. What my problem is the philosophy behind the setups. I have a perimeter firewall and a back-end firewall all controlling access. Is the way I made the Network Diagram a good practice or a terrible practice ?</p>

<p>In addition I will like to setup a ""one-way"" trust between the Parent Domain and the Child Domain. </p>

<p>In addition I will only open up the firewall ports that I need to have the Primary DC communicate with the RODC. And nothing else</p>

<p>Some Network Info: </p>

<p>DMZ: 192.168.10.0/24 - Child Domain: DMZ.Contoso.com</p>

<p>LAN: 192.168.50.0/24 - Parent Domain: Contoso.com</p>

<p>Again, this type of question has been asked before but there are so many different opinions and ways of doing this type of setups that I want to know if mines is some what acceptable. </p>

Basically, these machines were too low-spec in their hardware to be upgraded to XP (and had cost a lot of money), so I continued to use them, with their original software: various installations of Windows 98SE and Windows ME (all running as 32-bit versions).</p>

<p>In the event, I never used XP. The Win9x machines were so reliable that they were still working long after XP and Vista had come and gone. But I eventually had to migrate, over a period of time, onto Windows 7 64-bit.</p>

<p>I am not about to do something really dumb, such as ask why such-and-such a program won't run on Win7 64bit! :-)</p>

<p>Without exception, all the software I had been running on 32bit Windows 98SE worked out-of-the-box (so to speak) on Win7's NT 64bit architecture. Today, I still use a variety of this software, especially the word processing programs and HTML editors that I use routinely.</p>

<p>Is there a technical reason why I never experienced the difficulties I had expected in running Windows 9x programs on 64bit NT? I've been told about 'compatibility' settings on Win7, but have never had to run a program in ""compatibility-mode"".</p>

<p>I'm aware of Windows 7 keeping 32-bit and 64-bit software in separate locations, and handling them differently: but I had expected that this was related to 32bit and 64bit programs written for Windows 7.</p>

<p>I am surprised that Windows 98 32bit programs seem to be entirely compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7 32bit programs, and would like to understand why this is so. Is there really no difference between them?</p>

<p>Also, many of the old Windows 9x programs were/are portable. I have been in the habit of putting them on USB sticks, or on the Windows 7 desktop, and just running them. I've not experienced any problems. Even though they are not being run from a Program Files folder. Again, I'd like to understand why does the O/S not object to this, from a technical perspective?</p>

<p>Am I doing anything unsafe? The Windows 7 O/S seems very stable: but I would like to know whether I am asking it to do things that I ought not to.</p>

"1570471","OpenVPN client listening on 0.0.0.0","<p>I am testing and calibrating OpenVPN in Linux, using free VPNs initially.</p>
<p>According to all sources I have seen, the OpenVPN proxy should be listening on localhost:1194. In fact it consistently listens on 0.0.0.0, the origin, and a browser will only connect to OpenVPN with proxy set to this address at the usual port.</p>
<p>0.0.0.0 is unmentioned in man openvpn. One mention online shows this address in a server implementation, but I am running a client using a client.ovpn with no indication of 0.0.0.0. Online advice generally warns of applications listening on the origin, but more importantly, all documentation I have seen assumes OpenVPN listens on localhost:1194 and browsers should be set to this proxy.</p>
<p>Why is OpenVPN listening on the wrong address, and how can I fix it?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Looking again at man openvpn I see the 0.0.0.0 mentioned as 'default gateway' and localhost given as management IP.</p>
<p>All mention I recall seeing of using commercial VPNs with OpenVPN and of using browsers with OpenVPN suggested or implied using localhost:1194. This is implied too in that most proxies listen on localhost (Tor, Privoxy, etc.). Despite the below comment, OpenVPN and VPN clients in general are indeed discussed widelyas if they are proxies - avaiable listening services, like socks or http tunnels, to which an application ports net activity.</p>
<p>None I saw mentioned having to enter 0.0.0.0:1194 as the working proxy, and indeed, Firefox would not work with OpenVPN unless the address:port are explicitly given.</p>
<p>The only tutorials I have for iptables with OpenVPN only suggest specifying dport, but never address, suggesting the port is on localhost.</p>
<p>All mention is in stored documents from the web for which I lack the URL, and have no time to search online right now.</p>
<p>Discussions of the 0.0.0.0 IP suggest that a service listening here is doing so on all interfaces, which I immediately view as problematic. I would rather restrict a listener to a specific interface, ie. localhost. For example, the following appears elsewhere on Superuser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a service is listening on 0.0.0.0 this means the service is
listening on all the configured network interfaces, when listening on
127.0.0.1 the service is only bound to the loopback interface (only available on the local machine)</p>
<p>The IP address 0.0.0.0 can have very different meanings, depending on
where it's used.</p>
<p>It's not a valid address to be given to an actual network interface,
along with any other address in the 0.0.0.0/8 subnet (i.e. any address
starting with 0.). It can't be used as the source address on any IP
packet, unless this happens when a computer still doesn't know its own
IP address and it's trying to acquire one (classic example: DHCP). If
used in a routing table, it identifies the default gateway; a route to
0.0.0.0 is the default one, i.e. the one used when there is not any more specific route available to a destination address. Lastly, when
seen in the output of the netstat command (which is what you asked
for), it means that a given socket is listening on all the available
IP addresses the computer has; when a computer has more than one IP
address, a socket can be bound only to a specific address and port
pair, or to a port and all addresses; if you see an IP address there,
it means that socket is listening only on that port and that specific
address; if you see 0.0.0.0, it means it's listening on that port on
all addresses of the machine, including the loopback one (127.0.0.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar is suggested on Lifewire with ominous tone; this is the worse for the fact that OpenVPN runs as root during its initialization phase before falling back to an unprivileged user, and no mitigation for this exists for Debian AFAIK.</p>

<p>At <code>99.88.77.66.55</code>, I have a LAN sitting behind my firewall.  On this LAN, I have three servers:</p>

</ol>
<p>See the diagram below for clarification.  All three servers are running as virtual servers within jails on the same freeBSD (freeNAS) system.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XJiou.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XJiou.png"" alt=""Network Diagram"" /></a></p>
<h3>What I Want to Accomplish</h3>
<p>As per the above diagram, I want to add a reverse proxy server to run within a jail on the above-mentioned system.  Requests from the WAN need to be directed to the appropriate server based on the name of the host supplied in the HTTP header.</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standard Port Fordwarding:</strong> Currently, I access these servers through simple port-forwarding on the LAN Router.  This is usually an acceptable solution, however, when the need arises to trouble the network remotely, it becomes a challenge keeping straight WAN-to-LAN port relationships.  Also, for users other than myself, who need to access these servers, it is easier for them not to have to remember port numbers.</li>
<li><strong>DD-WRT Application:</strong> Since my router is running DD-WRT firmware with a 4 GiB USB drive mounted, I looked into installing and running a reverse proxy server on the router, using Pound or something similar.  I have done extensive web searching looking for ways to this.  The problem I encounter is that most of the guides or tutorials are old and contain broken links to the resources required.</li>
<li><strong>Apache/Nginx:</strong> Either of these two seem like a viable solution.  However, like the DD-WRT solutions I researched, many of the guides either provide broken links or no links at all to the required resources.  The other hurdle before me with either the Apache or Nginx options is that most of the guides and tutorials assume I already know everything there is to know about Apache or Nginx.  I am starting out with no prior experience with either platform, and am willing to learn, and experiment to get things to work.  The guides and tutorials mostly only show the <code>server</code> sections of the required code.  Also, assumptions are made that you already know the dependencies required, and how to implement them.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Steps I've Already Taken</h3>
<p><strong>Nginx:</strong>  Sample from my nginx.conf file.  It is only a portion.  There are other <code>server</code> sections for the other servers with the pertinent details changed.</p>
<pre><code>#nginx.conf

events {
  worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name sub1.dom1.com #I've also tried www.lan.lan, here.
    access_log off;
    error_log off;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://192.168.1.3:80/;
      proxy_redirect off;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_ass_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;
      client_max_body_size 10m;
      client_body_buffer_size 128k;
      proxy_connect_timeout 90;
      proxy_send_timeout 90;
      proxy_ready_timeout 90;
      proxy_buffer_size 4k;
      proxy_buffers 4 32k;
      proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
      proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This, however; returns a 502 - Bad Gateway error when trying to connect.</p>
<p><strong>Apache:</strong>  Important to note that I was trying this with Apache22.  My latest httpd.conf file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>LoadFile /usr/local/bin/libxml2.so
LoadModule proxy_html_module libexec/apache22/mod_proxy_html.so
LoadModule xml2enc_module libexec/apache22/mod_xl2enc.so

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName sub1.dom1.com
  ServerAlias sub1.dom.com
  ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.3:80/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.1.3:80
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName sub2.dom2.com
  ServerAlias sub2.dom2.com
  ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.4:8069/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.1.4:8069
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName sub3.dom2.com
  ServerAlias sub3.dom2.com
  ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.5:2430/
  ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.5:2430
&lt;/VirtualHost
</code></pre>
<p>When I try to start Apache22, using:</p>
<pre><code>service apache22 start
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following:</p>
<pre><code>Invalid command 'ProxyPass', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
</code></pre>
<p>After much research, I know this is more than likely caused by the fact that I only one of many of the required <code>mod_proxy</code> modules loaded, the <code>mod_proxy_html</code> module.  The reason is that after extensive searching, I could only find a working link for this specific module.</p>
<p><strong>Pound:</strong>  I ran into problems when trying to install ipkg on DD-WRT.  This might be due to the atheos architecture of my particular router.  I also ran into many broken links as previously mentioned.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok, so with the long-winded explanation out of the way, here is what I'm looking for from the community.</p>
<p>Given that I've gotten closest using Nginx, how can I properly setup my <code>nginx.conf</code> file to do what I am attempting to do?  What is causing the 502 error, and how do I fix it?</p>

"1167782","Hyper-V Does Not Work However VMWare Does","<p>I recently rebuilt my main Hyper-V server along with the other two servers and since my entire network is still running Windows 7, I decided to swap 2012 R2 out with 2008 R2. Now my two secondary servers are working great.</p>

<p>The problem lies in the main one. Hyper-V will not initialize a VM. To make sure I hadn't messed up the BIOS I uninstalled Hyper-V and installed VMWare Workstation. It has no problem with VMs. I really do not want to have to use VMWare though as all my VMs are already in Hyper-V format and to be honest I much prefer Hyper-V to VMware.</p>

<p>For reference the machine is clean install and both VMs are fresh. I have also verified my install media and confirmed that it is good. </p>

<p>Exact Error -</p>

<pre><code>[Window Title]
Hyper-V Manager

[Main Instruction]
An error occurred while attempting to start the selected virtual machine(s).

[Content]
'New Virtual Machine' could not initialize.

The virtual machine could not be started because the hypervisor is not running. 

[Expanded Information]
'New Virtual Machine' could not initialize. (Virtual machine ID 3C2AAECF-136C-4BB8-A2F8-8690E97F5ED0)

The virtual machine could not be started because the hypervisor is not running.  The following actions may help you resolve the problem:

1) Verify that the processor of the physical computer has a supported version of hardware-assisted virtualization.

2) Verify that hardware-assisted virtualization and hardware-assisted data execution protection are enabled in the BIOS of the physical computer.  (If you edit the BIOS to enable either setting, you must turn off the power to the physical computer and then turn it back on.  Resetting the physical computer is not sufficient.)

3) If you have made changes to the Boot Configuration Data store, review these changes to ensure that the hypervisor is configured to launch automatically.

  <p>i. If able to boot to the desktop successfully, delete the old ""System

</blockquote>

<p>I've followed all of his steps successfully until it came to step f where he asked to make the new SYSTEM RESERVED volume as active. The option is simply not there, but I'm assuming that will be OK. I'm using Windows 7. What I did notice is that in his step b., Windows warned that formatting my new volume would cause my disk to become dynamic (""The operation you selected will convert the selected basic disk(s). If you convert the disk(s) to dynamic, you will not be able to start installed operating systems from any volume on the disk(s) (except the current boot volume). Are you sure you want to continue?"" I clicked Yes, by the way.). Later on in his step F, I was a bit stumped until <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726994.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I found a NOTE on a Microsoft help page.</a> Per Microsoft, ""You can't mark volumes as active.

"1408422","How can this VBA be adjusted","<p>As per your request The original post is here <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1407077/how-do-i-hide-rows-based-on-a-cell-value"">How do I hide rows based on a cell value</a></p>

<p>I have received the VBA below from Ted D, following a question I posted here. 
Unfortunately it is not working completely:</p>

<p>•   After I insert the first number (but not 0) in a cell in B column, all the rows that have zero in that column are hidden - which is great. </p>

<p>•   The problem is - and please excuse me for not mentioning it from the beginning- that everytime I use that worksheet, several cells in B column must be filled with numbers bigger than 0. So, it would be of much help to hide the rows that contain 0 in column B, after I filled all the other cells that I need. </p>

<p>•   I was thinking, that maybe, if there is a condition - the rows with 0 in B column to be hidden  only after a certain  merged cell is filled with text? I do not know if it is possible, but I have no other idea.</p>

<p>This is the VBA: </p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()

  ' Hide Rows if row value in watch_Column is hide_On_Value.
  ' watch_Column must include start_on row number (e.g. A1 or C3)

  ' Hidden rows, beyond the range of cells with values, may not
  ' unhide. For speed, only process rows being used &lt;= end_of_watch.
    Const watchColumn = ""B45"" ' Beginning Cell (row and column) to watch.
    Const endOfWatch = ""135"" ' Last row. if """", rest of rows in use.
    Const hideOnValue = 0

    Dim hideRange As Range
    Dim unhideRange As Range
    Dim r As Range
    Dim seeRow As Boolean
    Dim watchStart() As String
    Dim lastRow As String
    Dim tmpEnableEvents As Boolean

    Set watchRange = Me.UsedRange ' call and discard to reset LastCell
    lastRow = Me.Range(watchColumn).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell).Row
    If endOfWatch &lt;&gt; """" Then
       If Val(lastRow) &gt; Val(endOfWatch) Then lastRow = endOfWatch
    End If
    watchStart = Split(Me.Range(watchColumn).Address(True, False), ""$"")
    If Val(watchStart(1)) &gt; Val(lastRow) Then Exit Sub
    tmpEnableEvents = Application.EnableEvents
    Application.EnableEvents = False
    For Each r In Me.Range(watchColumn &amp; "":"" &amp; watchStart(0) &amp; lastRow)
        seeRow = True
        If IsEmpty(r) Then
        ElseIf CStr(r.Value2) = vbNullString Then
        ElseIf r = hideOnValue Then
            seeRow = False
            If Not r.EntireRow.Hidden Then
                If hideRange Is Nothing Then
                    Set hideRange = r
                Else
                    Set hideRange = Union(hideRange, r)
                End If
            End If
        End If
        If seeRow And r.EntireRow.Hidden Then
            If unhideRange Is Nothing Then
                Set unhideRange = r
            Else
                Set unhideRange = Union(unhideRange, r)
            End If
        End If
    Next r
    If Not unhideRange Is Nothing Then
        unhideRange.EntireRow.Hidden = False
    End If
    If Not hideRange Is Nothing Then

<p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>

<p><strong>The initial situation was:</strong> </p>

<p>I have a worksheet which has many formulas and I need the following to happen: when this worksheet is used, and some cells on different rows are filled with a number other than 0, the rows which contain cells with 0, to hide automatically. And this should happen every time that worksheet is used, with different values. 
About the attached example: </p>

<p>•   The value that changes is in column B </p>

<p>•   D, E and F are merged cells on each row </p>

<p>• <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/HCAnJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/HCAnJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> talking about the attached example: I need rows with Text2, Text 4 and Text 5 to be hidden automatically, because in B column the value is zero for these rows.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT! - at each use of the worksheet, the rows that have 0 in column B are different. Not always the same. And also, this automatization must apply only to a certain selection in the document (let's say from rows 45 to 135).</p>

<li>Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX b450-f</li>
<li>GPU: RTX 2080</li>

<p>So my first issue...
When I try to run the game in the VM (I was able to get Windows installed and everything on both VMs and am using VirtualBox), it gives me an error saying this machine doesn't have support for OpenGL. I checked with Task Manager, Device Manager, CPU-Z, and NVidia's driver installer and the GPU is not being detected by either machine. How can I make it so this GPU is being shared by all 3 machines? If VirtualBox doesn't have this feature, is there another (preferably free) virtual machine software that does?</p>

<p>My second issue...
I can't seem to remote desktop to any machine on any port other than 3389 (Microsoft's default remote desktop port). Currently, I have my host system hosting to 3389 so I'd like to host my VMs on 3390 and 3391. I made sure to port forward, configure the remote port in VirtualBox, change it in Windows Registry, and enable remote desktop in windows, yet I can't connect to either machine from my local network, or a nonlocal network.</p>

<p>If anyone has any ideas for solutions, let me know.
All help is appreciated.</p>

<p>It started a while back ago, my Internet (Ethernet) just stopped working for my pc. I tried everything to get it to work but nothing worked.</p>

<p>I reinstalled my PC, installed everything I needed and just about when I installed MSI Afterburner with Rivatuner the Internet stopped working again. So I thought for myself that either or both Afterburner and Rivatuner was the problem.</p>

<p>I reinstalled my pc again, installed everything again. I tried installing Afterburner without Rivatuner this time and guess what, the Internet worked fine. Until four days ago when the same problem appeared.</p>

<p>I reinstalled my PC once again, but this time I didn't install CCleaner. Because I thought I wouldn't need it.</p>

<p>And Just now, today, when I installed CCleaner (with avast along with CCleaner) to clean my pc a bit, and my Internet stopped working...</p>

<p>I didn't want to reinstall my PC this time because I already had done that four days ago and I was tired of it, so I tried to restart my pc a couple of times but nothing happens.</p>

<p>I uninstall both CCleaner and Avast, restart my PC, and now the Internet works fine while I'm typing this post trying to figure out what the heck is wrong with my PC.</p>

"1169841","Excel - Returning value only from current and 3 previous rows","<p>I have a spreadsheet with 3 columns. Column 1 is a list of Jurisdiction Types (State, City, County and District) and Column 2 is the Name of the corresponding Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>I need to combine some of the names in Column 2 into a string that displays in Column 3, depending on their corresponding ""Jurisdiction Type"" in Column 1 as such:</p>

<ol>
<li>State and City names will not change and will basically just reappear in Column 3</li>
<li>I am appending the city to the county names</li>
<li>I am appending the county names to the district names.</li>
<li>In cases where ""Not Applicable"" is a value: If it is a state or city, it will be shown in Column 3 but I am eliminating ""Not Applicable"" from any strings (so it will not be appended to any county or district names).</li>
</ol>

<p>My formula is:</p>

<pre><code>=IF(A13=""State"", B13, IF(A13=""City"",IF(A13=""NOT APPLICABLE"", ""NOT APPLICABLE"", B13),IF(A13=""County"",IF(A13=""NOT APPLICABLE"", ""NOT APPLICABLE"", IF(VLOOKUP(""City"", A10:B13,2, FALSE)=""NOT APPLICABLE"", B13, VLOOKUP(""City"", A10:B13,2, FALSE) &amp; "" "" &amp; B13)),IF(A13=""District"",IF(B13=""NOT APPLICABLE"", ""NOT APPLICABLE"", IF(VLOOKUP(""County"", A10:B13,2,FALSE)=""NOT APPLICABLE"", B13, VLOOKUP(""County"", A10:B13,2, FALSE) &amp; "" "" &amp; B13))))))
</code></pre>

<p>I've been able to accomplish the above and everything seems to be working okay. However, I am worried about the way I've used <code>VLOOKUP</code> to find the data. This is a very long list and as I drag the formula down, the <code>VLOOKUP</code> range changes. So, for example, in the 4th row, the range is A2:B5 but then as I drag it down, it becomes A3:B6, A4:B7, etc. I'm wondering if, there is a way to alter the range in the VLOOKUP function or if I should be using another function altogether in order to instruct the formula to always only look in the current row plus the 3 rows prior.  </p>

"1170137","High local ping when two people try to game at the same time (local or online)","<p>Okay, I apologise in advance if this isn't the sort of question intended for here.  It looked like it was because <a href=""https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/"">https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/</a> looks like it's intended for people who are professional network engineers.  I am not.</p>

<p>I'm asking here because my research options have been exhausted.  I did try <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/5merg5/ping_to_router_is_high_under_certain_circumstances/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">posting about this on reddit</a>, without success.  I've since done even further research since then.</p>

<p>I've linked to the reddit thread for reference purposes, but I'll try to summarise everything I know here (and will gladly answer any questions in the comments that may help), in the hopes of finally finding out what on Earth is going on.  I'm afraid this is going to be somewhat lengthy.</p>

<p><strong>The scenario and the problem</strong></p>

<p>Me and my brother attempt to play a game such as CounterStrike: Global Offensive at the same time.  It could be online or he could locally host it (which we tried for testing purposes).</p>

<p>When we both play, the local ping (to the router) will rapidly become high and fluctuate, for everyone wirelessly connected to the router (even those not trying to play online).  By extension, this obviously causes high latency to internet servers and so on, causing web-page timeouts, etc.</p>

<p>One of us disconnecting from the game (not the network) will resolve the problem almost immediately.</p>

<p>The problem will occur whether it's just me and my brother connected to the router, or if there are others connected; it appears to make no difference.</p>

<p>The problem is rarely experienced if we both try and download something at the same time, and if it is experienced, it's less severe than with gaming.</p>

<p>Initially I suspected it was the wireless hardware for the TP-Link WD-W8970 V1 router we use.  However, today I tried out a different device (a Belkin F7D4302 v1), running DD-WRT (v24-sp2 (03/25/13) mega (SVN revision 21061)).  I connected it via an ethernet cable to the TP-Link router, and then switched off the TP-Link's wireless and me and my brother then tested it again, wirelessly connected to the second router, and experienced the same problem.</p>

<p>One possible reason for this that I've read could be packet-retransmission due to packet-loss, but I'm unsure how to identify this if it is the problem.  After leaving it on for a bit, and trying out a few tests with my brother, under Status >> Sys-Info, it had the following statistics:</p>

<pre><code>Received (RX)401552 OK, 1 errors 
Transmitted (TX)534051 OK, 591 errors 
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing that having any errors is probably bad, but 591 doesn't seem like that many compared with the number that were OK, and examples I've seen online of this statistic with things going wrong seemed to have a lot more errors.</p>

<p>The router running DD-WRT gives me a lot of extra information which I'm hoping might shed some light on the problem, if I could actually understand it.</p>

<p>I've also tried raising and lowering TX power/transmission power, on both routers.  It had no impact on the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Additional information</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We live in the middle of nowhere.  There's no other wireless networks anywhere around us.</li>
<li>We do not own a microwave (research suggests they can cause interference).</li>
<li>Me and my brother's rooms are pretty close, but are on the opposite side of the house to the router.  We do seem to get solid connections to the router though (aside from this issue).</li>
<li>Our internet connection is slow, but shouldn't have any bearing on what the local ping is.  Indeed, the bandwidth usage of the game we play doesn't come anywhere near to what our max-bandwidth is (160KB/s download, 50KB/s upload).</li>
<li>I work as a software developer, so I'd like to think I'm reasonably competent when it comes to technical things such as this, but I'm not deluded enough to think that writing software gives me a solid understanding of networking concepts and hardware.  It's possible I've overlooked something really obvious, but if I have, I don't know what it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know what I'm missing.  Googling this has turned up nothing of use, and I do not even know if my search terms are going along the right lines.</p>

<p>Apologies again if this is the wrong section (or if my tags are wrong - I tried to select ones that seemed to fit, but if there's better ones then please let me know), but if it is, PLEASE direct me to where this question should go so that I can perhaps have a chance of getting some answers to this problem.</p>

<p>Long story:</p>

<ul>
<li>does not install OS X (stop sign or reset depending on the version I'm trying to install)</li>
<li>an OS X Mountain Lion has been installed on the laptop but it was always resetting during OS bootup and before next boot an error screen in 7 languages would appear informing of previous issue and process repeats (no matter how much I tried to find out why the laptop was resetting I did not succeed)</li>
<li>I got fed up of trying to install Mac OS and installed Windows 10 (the irony - wasn't able to install Mac OS on a Mac but windows had no issues)</li>
<li>Bootcamp drivers have been installed (for some devices the driver had to be manually selected - bluetooth, SMU)</li>
</ul>

<p>Problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>none of the 2 video cards work properly</li>
</ul>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>the 9400m board appears in device manager as ""Microsft basic visual adapter"" (detected by GPU-z as 9400m)</li>
<li>I tried to select the drivers manually but unsuccessfully - after the driver install restart the screen is black and after 20 seconds it restarts and goes into a loop or the device manager driver update fails and automatically starts the uninstaller for the nVidia video drivers</li>
<li>the 9600m GT board appears correctly installed in device manager, but with error 43 on the details - there are very good chances that the board is dead / needs reballing / need capacitors changed - problems on this model are many</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I run CPU-z, GSOD with WDF_ERROR when it loads ""sensors""</li>
<li>When I run CPU-z in safe mode, it's all good</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<strong>Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I have installed MacOS 10.10 via an older hdd's recovery tool.
The Mac boots only with nv_disable=1 -> the 9600m GT card is dead.
MacOS cannot even play 480p video on youtube with the nv_disabled tag
Installed Widnwos 10 via Bootcamp. Exact same issues as in EFI install. </p>

<p><strong>PS</strong> If this helps, the HWID of the 9400m is PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_0866&amp;SUBSYS_00AF106B&amp;REV_B1</p>

<p>Google searches did not help. VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_0866 drivers did not work. The display would turn black and the laptop would restart.</p>

<p>Legacy support was enabled (by default) when i install Ubuntu and everything was working well until yesterday. I found on HP forums that this error occurred because legacy support isnt enabled, but mine was enabled</p>

<p>What can i do ?</p>

I got a friend to put in the External IP, but his iPhone told him: ""Safari could not open the page because the server stopped responding"". The ports and firewall on my router are configured, but it still does not work. So I made sure my Raspberry Pi's firewall allowed the port. I even changed the external port just in case my ISP was blocking it but when I tried to load it on my computer, my browser told me that it can't connect to the server. If my ISP is blocking my server, can I get around it? And if it's my router blocking it, how can I get around that? (I have a Netgear R5900P). I've been doing a lot of searching and I have not found the answer yet. A simple and clear answer would be very appreciated.</p>

I have searched the web for any and all possible fixes, I have replaced the motherboard, hard drive, psu and even tried pulling ram cards out to see if one of them could be bad and still the issue persists.
I have tried to fix it 3 times so far replacing a different part each time, the weird thing is that the pc will work flawlessly for 2 days then the reboot issue comes back.</p>

<li>First fix 
Replaced old cpu hydro cooled heatsink without any change. </li>
<li>Replaced the psu 
Worked fine for 2 days then rebooted couple of times and stopped booting up completely</li>
<li>Figures it was the mother board swapped out my old Asus sabertooth z87 for a z97 model, worked fine for 2 days then the restarts came back</li>
<li>I noticed the pc was running slow and glitching so thought it could be the ssd, that same day the pc crashed and the ssd could not be detected in the bios </li>
<li>Replaced the SSD with HDD and it worked fine for 3 days, now the restarts are back again. </li>
<li>Just now i tried alternating the ram cards, as in tried to boot with one or the other to see if that makes a difference, the pc continues to crash to the point where it will even crash in BIOS. </li>

<p>I have an Excel sheet that has text values (like the examples above).</p>

<p>I want a way I can convert them into days such that:</p>

<p>If I have 12hrs, it rounds off to the nearest day and becomes 1 Day.
If it is more than 12 hrs, it can say for example 1 day 2 hrs. Until the 2hrs grows to 12hrs it becomes 1 day.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the values are in <strong>General format</strong> and not date or time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I see the hours is making it so difficult.</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Can we ignore the hrs from both the input value: it should be total 12
   = 1day 3hr (where 3 is the hours or without hr).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't want to convert to strings. If the formula is <strong>without hrs it is fine.</strong> My point is how to had i.e. 2 , 3 , 1, each representing hours when it gets to a total of 12, it becomes one day. 12 hours = 1 day. you can ignore hrs in the formula. </p>

<p>I can move Installer back to SSD, but it takes ~ 15GB. What I am trying to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the reason to read all install files?</li>
<li>Can I disable it somehow?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've added this folder to ""Exclude"", but it still accessed at boot time.

"1173031","Why two folders for MS Office installation","<p>I recently bumped into a major issue with my MS Office 2007 installation regarding Access 2007, which gave me an error that it could not properly reference ActiveX Data Objects 6.1.</p>

<p>While trying to solve the problem, I found that the Office installation has two very similar folders:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\System\ado\</code></li>
<li><code>C:\Program Files      \Common Files\System\ado\</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Both folders have very similar content but all files are of slightly different size. This is where many of the Access reference ActiveX Data Objects are stored.</p>

<p>I found that by default my Access Reference navigator is leading me into the <code>(x86)</code> folder and the other folder is <strong>not</strong> available for me to navigate and choose the actual desired DLL file.</p>

<p>I also found that Microsoft has never published a 64bits version of Office (I doubt that information), which I think means that it would make sense that all files would be in the <code>(x86)</code> folder.</p>

<p>Why would there be two different folders with pretty much the same file names (of different size) (which imply that same name files are of different codes)?</p>

<p>Does this mean that there are two different versions of ActiveX Data Objects 6.1?</p>

<p>Could that mean that my problem was that I could not reference the proper file version?</p>

<hr>

<p>PS: I finally had to fix the bug by running the Repair command from the installation CD.</p>

"1173767","What hardware/firmware factors might be behind Windows XP taking several hours to boot up?","<p>I have an old Dell Dimension 2400 desktop with Windows XP (circa 2003) that I use pretty much solely for playing old video games.  Unfortunately, though, lately it's become somewhat of a problem.  If I Hibernate it every time I'm done with it, it works okay, but if I accidentally turn it off instead of placing it in hibernate, the next time I try to power it on it sometimes takes many hours to boot up again, stuck at the Windows XP logo screen (with the progress bar).</p>
<p>My first thought was that it was a software problem.   Who wouldn't, right?  This is the original 13-year old installation of Windows XP, so it's highly likely that the Registry and probably other important stuff are a tangled spaghetti mass by now.  So I bought a new 250 GB hard drive, dropped it in (the previous hard drive was just 40 GB!!), and reinstalled from the DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of solving the problem, it just got worse!</strong>  My brand-new installation exhibited literally the <em>exact</em> same behavior, spending hours at the XP logo screen.  I left it overnight to see what would happen and the next day it still hadn't booted.  This is actually worse than the way it behaved with the old hard drive.</p>
<p>So this is almost certainly a hardware or firmware issue given that it appeared independent of the hard drive and Windows installation present.</p>
<h2>Any ideas as to how I should proceed?</h2>

"1577974","ffmpeg - losslessly compress upscaled video","<p>I cannot seem to find a good answer to this. I have a video file, h264, 1280x720, 251.2 MB.</p>
<p>However the video is upscaled, the actual quality is 1024x576. And not just the numbers are different, there actually are more pixels, I know this because I have the same video in that resolution, and it is around 70 MB, the quality is the same or arguably better. Can I compress the video using ffmpeg back to 576p and that same size, with no quality loss? In other words, can I get rid of the extra pixels without harming the good pixels?</p>
<p>The best result I've got so far is like this:
<code>ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 23 -acodec copy -vf &quot;scale=1024:576&quot; output.mp4</code>, but there is a slight quality loss. Can I do this completely losslessly?</p>
<p>edit: maybe my wording was unclear. Of course it can't magically know which pixels to get rid of, but that can be calculated, can't it? Say I have a 4x4 image, composed of 4 colors in a 2x2 grid. Now I can easily compress that to a 2x2 image and lose nothing at all, I can take pixels of the same color and group them into one, thus having less information. Can't that process be done for my upscaled video? (along with losslessly compressing every frame). I do not mind the output codec being different.</p>
<p>In a few words, I want to take every frame, downscale it by lowering the number of pixels (which does not result in any quality loss whatsoever because the video is upscaled), then compress the result to a lossless codec. Lossy to lossless shouldn't result in quality loss. I can't understand what's not possible about this.</p>

"1578806","Only a fraction of total available RAM is used by the system","<p>I have 32Gb of RAM from 2 sticks. But only 27Gb is ever used by the sytem. That is even when the system runs into memory issue -- when my programs throw errors related to memory issues, when loading a directory of 30 files in Explorer from an SSD takes a minute, etc etc.</p>
<p>Both Hardware Info and Process Explorer report the remaining 5Gb of available physical memory.</p>
<p>The fact that no more than 27Gb RAM can be used by my system started from when I first built the system. I thought it was a mere coincidence. Back then, I ran memtest for a day and had no error. (Can't do that now. I have programs running 24/7.) There used to be stability issue somewhere in the Ryzen 3600 + X570 mobo + Win 10 combo. That was gone after one of the mobo firmware update. Other than that, I haven't had any hardware issues. But recently I've been needing the RAM space and so the RAM bottleneck is quite a problem.</p>
<p>What are some possible reasons behind this memory bottleneck? How do I get the system to use more of the physical RAM?</p>

And is it optimal to allow PC in hibernate/sleep mode, to allow the quick wake up, won't there be any problem?   </p>

<p>I know this has something to do with permissions, but I have absolutely no clue on how to fix it. I can read my samba server from both a Windows 10 box and by Ubuntu 17.10 box. The samba server is running on a Raspberry Pi 3, which is running the latest version of Raspbian Lite, (which in case you didn't know, is basically really light Debian Stretch). I have a test hard drive in it (which is just a USB drive) on <code>/dev/sda1</code>, and my share folder in <code>/media/USBHDD/share</code>. </p>

<p>So, I'm going to dump the <code>smb.conf</code> files and the perms for my media directories in the hope that one of you can help me make some sense out of this. </p>

<pre><code>#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with "";"", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with ""#"", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# ""testparm"" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors.

# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.

# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.

# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d


####### Authentication #######

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are ""standalone server"", ""member server"", ""classic primary
# domain controller"", ""classic backup domain controller"", ""active

# Most people will want ""standalone sever"" or ""member server"".
# Running as ""active directory domain controller"" will require first
# running ""samba-tool domain provision"" to wipe databases and create a
# new domain.

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.

"1416494","Issues setting up a bridge connection for serial devices","<p>I'm having trouble setting up a network of serial devices on a shop floor. I do have some basic networking experience but am not verbose in some of the more advanced settings.</p>

<p>I'm trying to setup a network of serial devices on a shop floor using the MOXA 2250A devices which are serial-to-wireless device servers. These 22550s have 2 serial ports which provide wireless functionality to some older serial equipment we have and they also include an ethernet port which can be set up for bridged mode. Right now, I connect to the serial devices using virtual COM ports on a PC set to the static ip address of the device and to the individual serial ports on the device.</p>

<p>The wireless device servers are connecting to a ubiquiti unifi AP and I'm able to connect just fine to the serial devices connected to the wireless device servers.</p>

<p>This is where it goes wrong. I would like to add a 3rd serial connection to the wireless devices through the built in ethernet connections on the devices and setting them up in bridged mode. I have some MOXA ethernet-to-serial device servers which are much cheaper than the wifi and would like to connect these to the wireless ones using the bridged ethernet connection.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I have the devices configured in static ip address mode but I'm running into the issue where I'm unable to connect to the ethernet device servers that are bridged. The devices allow configuration through a web browser but I can't connect to the device on the other end of the bridge.</p>

<p>The MOXA support has mentioned setting the wireless devices to allow for gratuitous ARP where I add the IP and MAC address of the ethernet devices connected to the wireless ones and they also state that the AP must have passive client mode enabled (which they said is generally only available on Cisco type networking devices) but I don't believe the ubiquiti AP has that setting.</p>

<p>I tried setting the devices to DHCP with and without GARP but had no success. I'm not able to establish a serial connection to the ethernet connected device or even ping it. MOXA does have a device search utility which does detect the ethernet device but I'm unable to access it or change the settings through it when it's connected through the bridge.</p>

<p>An example setup is default gateway 192.168.1.1, wireless device server/bridge 192.168.1.100 (has 2 serial ports on it) and ethernet-serial device 192.168.1.101 (has 1 serial port) using static addresses and connect to them using a PC on the network connect by a switch. I did try connecting the PC directly to the wireless device and the PC (in DHCP) had a good internet connection.</p>

<p>If I'm understanding the purpose of GARP correctly, is it that the devices on the other side of the bridge aren't showing up on the network so we are forcing the device setting up the bridge to notify the rest of the network of the existence of this device? If that's the case, I don't know why my PC was able to establish an internet connection no problem when connected to the wireless device but the ethernet-serial device be unsuccessful.</p>

Went to the main admin station, right clicked the station, ""Reboot in Thawed Mode"", boots back in frozen. I updated the server, tried to send the new updated config to the pc, nothing... I tried the Standard version (on another machine) and this one does the same. Is there a problem with the software?</p>

"1581644","Sharing Cable with multiple devices","<p>Comcast has wired our farm so that we have two taps coming off of the telephone pole.  One runs to the barn and one runs to the house.  While we need WiFi access in the barn to handle security camera feeds, we don't need the bandwidth afforded by 2 taps.  We also don't want to pay for two internet subscriptions.</p>
<p>Electrically, the two taps configuration is the cleanest.  When I spoke to the Comcast engineer, he said that there was not electrical continuity between the taps, suggesting that they have active HW on the telephone pole driving each tap.  If I tee one tap and put two terminations on it, the signal theory says that there will be reflections off of the tee and each of the taps making the line more noisy.  However, I know that you can put two cable modems on one cable, for example (See: <a href=""https://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Your-Home-Network/Using-two-2-internet-cable-modems-on-a-single-service-line/td-p/3297233"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Your-Home-Network/Using-two-2-internet-cable-modems-on-a-single-service-line/td-p/3297233</a>).  What I want is slightly different:</p>
<p>Can I take the signal from one tap, tee it at the bottom of the telephone pole and connect it to the wire to the barn and wire to the house. (distance from house to pole is 250ft; distance from barn to pole is 250ft; Comcast HW is at top of pole; tee would be at bottom of pole)</p>
<p>Then, in the barn I want to put an access point with a tunnel setup to a corresponding device in the house.  Finally, in the house I would put the comcast access point and have the tunnel set up to route any outgoing traffic to the comcast access point.</p>
<p>Please note that I am aware of other solutions to this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>I tried power line modems -- they were too finicky/unreliable for the distances involved;</li>
<li>I've investigated a line of sight antenna link, but the house is historic and I don't want to put a modern wifi antenna on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>As I have considered this more, I've been thinking of it like the LAN in my house. It can have multiple routers, multiple DHCP servers, multiple connections to the internet (see for example: <a href=""https://www.mushroomnetworks.com/blog/should-you-migrate-your-2-router-2-isp-network-to-a-multi-wan-router-network/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mushroomnetworks.com/blog/should-you-migrate-your-2-router-2-isp-network-to-a-multi-wan-router-network/</a>). The topology I describe would be reasonable/valid assuming I put a bridge at the point where the cable splits to house and barn.</p>
<p>Since Cable seemed to allow multiple devices on a single wire (is this in fact true? I thought I sited a reference where this was happening), I was hoping people would know of devices that would allow me to do with cable what I could do with my home network.</p>

<p>I apologize for the minimum details, so here's what I'm trying to do. I have a project name, priority #, project status, details, and various miscellaneous columns. I have my projects assigned a priority number from 1-8.

<ol>
<li>Number formatted cells in Excel have digits beyond the 15th changed

of credit card numbers which can be longer than 15 digits.  A work around to this behavior in Excel is to format cells that will contain credit card numbers (in advance of entering the data) as strings instead of numbers.</li>
<li>To display this string in a more user-friendly format I add a helper
column that takes the string and chunks it out.  </li>
<li>I do this by testing the length of the string and if it is 16

<p>Column A is populated with Name, which has both First &amp; Second Name. I need to filter records based on multiple criteria, skipping those Names that contain an apostrophe [ ' ] symbol or a number, and copying those that contain neither to column B.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>  Col A                Col B

  Henry 'James'                     (Contains apostrophe)
  Henry Peter          Henry Peter  (No apostrophe or number)
  Henry PP123                       (Contains number)
</code></pre>

<p>According to this example, only Henry Peter should be copied.</p>

<p>There are many obvious ways to do this if it requires testing for a single condition.  In this case, there can potentially be any combination of numbers and/or apostrophe, contained anywhere in the column A value.  So there is a substantial list of conditions to test for in each cell.</p>

<p>The creation of the bootable USB might have had nothing to do with it and was probably just a coincidence.</p>
<p>To fix the issue, I reinstalled Avast.</p>
<p>Later when I tried to install mirc, I got an error message that it could not complete the installation. I thought &quot;hmm weird&quot;...and restarted the computer.</p>
<p>At the &quot;Windows starting&quot; screen, it went back to restart, showing me the recovery menu screen.</p>
<p>I selected safe mode but it would still not start...but rather again restart and go back to the recovery menu.</p>
<p>I noticed during the drivers load list when attempting to start at safe mode, it stopped at <code>\windows\system32\drivers\Aswardisk.sys</code> before restarting (boot loop).</p>
<p>Another thing to note (in case this piece of info has any relevance) is a momentary, split second flicker of BSOD right after the Windows starting screen before proceeding to restart.</p>
<p><strong>Things I've tried to remedy this issue:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Last known configuration (advanced).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Startup repair through Windows 7 installation disc. (No restore
points so couldn't do that).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Booted through Linux live USB and deleted the Avast folder in programs folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>chkdsk: c: /f /r</code>.
Result shows 0 KB in bad sectors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Renamed <strong>aswardisk.sys</strong> to <strong>aswardisk.sysa</strong>.<br />
Upon doing so, the drivers load list passed <strong>aswardisk.sys</strong> but then got stuck on another driver - <strong>aswbidsh.sys</strong>. So i did the same with that file.
Again, it passed that file, but got stuck on another file called <strong>aswbuniv.sys</strong>.</p>
<p>I continued this procedure with 2 more avast files - <strong>aswRvrt.sys</strong> and <strong>aswVmm.sys.</strong> But then it started to get stuck on non-Avast files, such as <strong>disk.sys</strong> and subsequently <strong>classpnp.sys</strong>. When I reached a file called <strong>fvevol.sys</strong>, renaming it did not result in safe mode passing/skipping the file like it did with the others, but rather go to a <strong>Windows Boot Manager</strong> screen like the 2nd screenshot <a href=""https://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/371318-failure-boot-fvevol-sys-corrupt.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>sfc /scannow /offbootdir=d:\ /offwindir=d:\windows</code>.
Result says <em>&quot;Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.&quot;</em></p>

(with non-powered ethernet usb hub)","<p>I need to connect a usb hub 15m from my computer, i've tried a hub with 4 slots and a power supply, and a 15m active usb cable. The hub has a wireless Xbox receptor (with up to 4 xbox controllers simultaneously), a wireless keyboard, a mouse, and sometimes another wireless keyboard and mouse (in a single slot).</p>

<p>That setup doesn't work. Even with the powered usb hub, I can use max one keyboard and mouse simultaneously, but thats it. If I add one more all of them stop working.</p>

<p>I made some research and found the best solution is to use a ethernet extender for those distances, and I happen to have already a spare 30m ethernet cable.</p>

<p>However all great solutions with a powered ethernet usb hub are meant for business and thus are way than I need.</p>

<p>So my question is if a non-powered ethernet hub would be enough to work with all the devices mentioned above simultaneously. And if not, what if I attach the 4 slot powered hub to it?</p>

<p>a) If only * exists (and % dont exist), then delete everything (including it), to the right, and give only the left part as result (example, cell B1 would give as result: Cell B1: adlkjadflaskd)</p>

<p>b) If only % exists (and * dont exist), then delete everything (including it), to the left, and give only the right part as result (example, cell B2 would give as result: Cell B2: 309982409)</p>

<p>c) If both * and % exists, when * comes first and whatever % or * comes after in any order these last 2, then, give as result only what is before the first * and delete the rest after the first * including it (example, cell B3 would give as result: Cell B3: lkaçlaskjdfçklsadjf)</p>

<p>d) If both % and * exists, when % comes first than * or even if another % comes after the first %, then, give as result only what is between the first % that appears with the * if the * is the next symbol after the % (if isnt, dont get result yet) and if between % and * inside the text exists a point (.) not in any other position (beginning/end). If there is %textwithpointinside*, get result, if not, no. If doesnt exist a point in between the text, check rest of the cell if there is another direct combination of %textwithpointinside* to print this first one that happens, and if there happens one result, dont need to look rest of the cell for other results, print only the first one. If there isnt any result between % and * with point inside, leave result in blank. (example, would give as result: Cell B4: foi.emb (because % exists with * while % comes first, and %foi.emb* is the first happening of %textwithpoint* while %bl.za* is the second result, so this second result would be disconsidered and only the first result would go to Cell B4)</p>

<p>e) If both % and * exist (example cells A5 and A6), with % coming first but without any direct %textwithpointinside* or if more than one % exist in the cell (exampe Cell A7) without any *, then, go to the last % of the cell and give as result the last text rightside after the last % but only if there is a point is inside this last text, and leave in blank if pont is before the text (cell A5), after the text (cell A7) or unexistant (cell A8). (example, would give as result: Cell B5: empty (because after last % the point is before the text not inside), Cell B6: e.nem (ok because after the last % there is a point inside the text. And result is not dfçklsadjfs because there was no point on it, otherwise if it had would be it), Cell B7: empty (because after the last % the point is not inside the text but in the end), Cell B8: empty (because after the last % there is no point)</p>

<p>f) If nor * nor % exist, then only copy the full text of the cell as the result if the text contains at least 1 point inside the text (cell A9). If there is a point before the text (cell A10) or after the text (cell A11), leave result in blank. And if there is no point in any place (Cell A12), leave result in blank. (example, would give as result: Cell B9: alksd.jflskjd (because doesnt have % nor * but has text with a point inside), Cell B10: empty (because there is a point before the text), Cell B11: empty (because there is a point after the text), Cell B12: empty, (because dont have * nor % nor a point)</p>

<p>Once the partitioning step is complete, select &quot;Back&quot; in the debian installer to return to the list of steps the installer is working through and break out to a shell by choosing the option &quot;Execute a shell&quot;.</p>
<p>The author said /target was there when I finished editing the partition and entered the shell via return. However, I tried several times and /target was only created after the Debian install started. So I couldn't proceed as the author explained.</p>

<p>YouTube also explains something similar in video. However, if I enter the shell before the Debian installation proceeds as shown in this video, /target is not created.
My Debian installer only creates /target after the Debian installation has started.</p>
<p>I know there is also a way to create subvolumes after installing Debian on the main volume without this process. However, In the current version of Debian, there was no up-to-date manual showing successful results simply by following the command line. I wanted to copy, but I failed because the result was different.</p>

I know how to do this in BIOS. The problem is that when the pc is booted, it requires a password to log in on windows.
The question is: How do I get my pc to login with my password automatically?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Clarification: What I want is to keep my account locked with a password. I don't want to disable my password in order to login automatically. The automation that I want, is to have a password, but inserted and log in automatically when my pc boots up automatically through rtc boot from bios.</p>

<p>Clarification 2: I don't want to disable my password universally. What I want is to still have my password active and inserted automatically when my pc boots automatically through rtc from bios. When I boot it up myself, I want it to ask me for the password.</p>

<p>I need to run an executable in batch. When run in interactive mode, the executable asks for a sequence of commands (each one of course followed by the Enter key) and finally it asks you to press the Enter key to continue (and finish). This last step is blocking me. I managed to write the following:</p>

<pre><code>mycode.exe &lt; batch.txt

<p>where the file <code>batch.txt</code> has the following content.</p>

<pre><code>bar.out
28
foo.in
summary.out
</code></pre>

<p>The four lines contain the correct commands <code>mycode.exe</code>. The problem is that I don't know how to send the ""Enter"" command to <code>mycode.exe</code>...is there a way? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: maybe I'm not using the right words. I'm not a programmer nor a computer scientist. I'll try with a practical example: if I open a <code>cmd</code> prompt and write (followed by Enter)</p>

<pre><code>D:\test&gt; mycode.exe
</code></pre>

<p>I get</p>

<pre><code>Enter output file name:
</code></pre>

<p>I write </p>

<pre><code>bar.out
</code></pre>

<p>Then I get a list of options among which to choose, and the prompt:</p>

<pre><code>Enter option from menu:
</code></pre>

<p>I enter</p>

<pre><code>28
</code></pre>

<p>I get</p>

<pre><code>Enter input file name:

<p>I enter </p>

<p>I get </p>

<pre><code>Enter summary file:

<p>I enter</p>

<pre><code>summary.out

<p>Starting Outlook results in being asked for an email address. After a little while, a window appears asking for credentials. The top left of the screen has the GoDaddy logo, so I guess autodiscover is working. The banner at the top of the screen says Office 365. I enter the email address and password and click on the Sign In button. A spinning logo appears next to Sign In and it just hangs. I left it for 30 minutes but it did not compete. Closing the window resulted in some options - enter a different email address, try again or troubleshoot. I tried several times with the same result.</p>
<p>Her old computer runs Outlook 2010 and this is working fine with GoDaddy. On a different computer running Outlook 2010, I set up a new Mail profile and added her GoDaddy account without any problem.</p>
<p>I ran the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer, selected Exchange Server and Outlook Connectivity and the test was successful.</p>
<p>Somehow (not sure how!) I got Outlook 2016 started but with no accounts configured. I went into File / Account Settings and tried adding the account there but with the same result. After entering the email address and password the window just hangs with the spinner going round.</p>

"1184602","How to use hard drive on home computer as temporary web server?","<p>Ok so basically I have a web server in a datacenter. However I have purchased a new enterprise SSD and I had it shipped to my house. Rather than installing it on another server in my datacenter, what I want to do is put some things on it while at my office, and later have it sent to the datacenter ready-to-go.</p>

<p>What I am not sure is what is involved in doing this. I am aware I need a static IP or at least an unchanging IP for the duration of the server's uptime while at my house. Besides that, I am not sure. Basically I want to fully configure a new server onto my new SSD (which I know how to do), but do that from home. That way I can send the completed and ready-to-go SSD to be plugged into my server.</p>

<p>What I want to know is how I can do this from home. I have a Windows computer. Of course, I will need to install CentOS onto the SSD and then be able to have it access the internet to do things like download software over SSH, etc.</p>

<p>What do I need to do for this? Can I perform this operation within Windows? How can I do this without booting into the drive alone (which would otherwise disable my computer while temporary server is in use, which is impractical)?</p>

<p>Moreover, how would I configure IP without having my ISP give me a static IP which my ISP does not offer (I asked)? Keep in mind this server is temporary only for configuration, would not be up for more than a week or two which means that my home external IP address would work just fine.</p>

<p>Any advice you could give on this operation will be very appreciated. I do not intend to run a home server as that is not a good idea for so many reasons. I only want to know how to do this because once I know how I can do a similar operation in the future when I need to. It sure beats the difficulties with remote setup and trying to get my server farm to exchange hard drives and assist in setup. I would prefer to do things myself as much as possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be clear, I am asking about running a server on a second drive in my computer from my home temporarily from within Windows.</p>

<p>My computer's main drive is running windows. I will be connecting this drive which will run CentOS as a second drive in my computer. My home internet has just 1 external IP address.</p>

<p>The details on issues I have regarding this are above. Rather than asking 7 different questions on Superuser about the same topic, I made it in just one question since it is all the same topic.</p>

<p>The goal is to turn on my computer running windows and install CentOS on the second drive which is my enterprise SSD which I just bought (I already know how to install CentOS). And then use this second drive as a web server in order to finish configuring the drive (which I already know how to do the software config) as a web server accessible on the internet.</p>

WAN IP2: bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb/25
LAN Subnet: 10.3.0.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>BOTH WAN addresses were routed to Linux Server, and  Linux server are reachable on both addresses. I want to route bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb to another host on LAN interface (10.3.0.2). </p>

<pre><code>INTERNET -- Linux Server
            (aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa/23, bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb/25 ens3)

<p>Now I want to route bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb onto my router on 10.3.0.2 via tap0 (bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb was a address on ens3). So my router will have a public IP address. This is what I have done: </p>

<pre><code>ip addr del bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb/25 dev ens3 # remove from ens3
ip route add bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb dev tap0   # route it to tap0
</code></pre>

<p>The graph will be like:</p>

<pre><code>INTERNET -- Linux Server
            (aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa/23 ens3)
            (10.3.0.1/24 tap0) -------- Router

                 INTERNET -- ISP NAT -- (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx eth0)
                                        (172.16.1.0/24 br-lan)
</code></pre>

<p>And, routing table on Linux Server: </p>

<pre><code>% ip -4 route
default via aaa.aaa.aaa.1 dev ens3 onlink 
10.3.0.0/24 via 10.3.0.1 dev tap0 
10.3.0.1 dev ens3  scope link

bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb dev tap0  scope link 
169.254.0.0/16 dev ens3  scope link
</code></pre>

<p>And on my router, I added address <code>bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb</code>, and I am now able to ping <code>bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb</code> on Linux server. </p>

<p>However, I can't ping <code>bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb</code> on other hosts. So I tried:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<p>With that rule I was able to ping <code>bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb</code> on internet. And if I do a traceroute, I can see bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb is behind aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>... 
10. ???
11. aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa                   0.0%    16   45.3  43.6  43.1  45.5   0.8

When I try MobaXterm using SFTP, it says SSHPUBLICKEY authentication failed, SSHPUBLICKEYAGENT authentication failed, but SSH authentication password (my account) passed, but I cant download or upload anything, most likely due to KEY authentication failing (not sure what that is).</p>

<p>I cannot add anything on to their unix servers or modify it - I just connect from home.</p>

<p>My motherboard is an ASUS Maximus VIII Hero: <a href=""https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/MAXIMUS-VIII-HERO/specifications/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/MAXIMUS-VIII-HERO/specifications/</a></p>

<p>This uses the Intel Z170 Chipset: <a href=""https://ark.intel.com/products/90591/Intel-GL82Z170-PCH"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ark.intel.com/products/90591/Intel-GL82Z170-PCH</a></p>

<p>I am currently using PCI-e risers to get all 6 onto the board. I have an extra 1060 that I'm trying to get running on the machine. I purchased this PCI-e 1-to-4 multiplier to split off one of the slots: <a href=""https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA1JM6CK2964&amp;Tpk=9SIA1JM6CK2964"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA1JM6CK2964&amp;Tpk=9SIA1JM6CK2964</a></p>

<p>I have this plugged into the PCIEX16/X8_1 slot on the board.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is that I am unable to get more than 6 to work at once. Specifically, if I go into Device Manager, one of the 1060s(seems to be ""random"") will always have a warning on it. When I go into the properties, the message says ""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"". If I go into Details, Problem code says 0000002B.</p>

<p>Steps taken:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Moved everything around; including swapping out riser cards, changing slots, power supplies to see if any pattern emerges.</p></li>
<li><p>Reset the CMOS and started over</p></li>
<li><p>Did a clean install of all the drivers (remove, restart, reinstall)</p></li>
<li><p>Googled the crap out of this. I see similar problems, but have not found a solution that works.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The card that is left out seems to be arbitrary. It <em>feels</em> like this is a game of musical chairs. The first 6 GPUs win and the 7th is left out. Some kind of ceiling I'm hitting.</p>

<p>The multiplier has no manual to be found. The motherboard itself doesn't have an obvious indication that it can't handle it. The chipset claims that it can handle up to 20 PCI-e lanes. I have all onboard devices and ports disabled that are not in use.</p>

<p>Two of the active GPUs(as of right now) are running off of the multiplier card, the one deactivated is one of the motherboard ports that used to work, so it's not a conflict simply on that single multiplied port.</p>

<p>I'm a software guy, not a hardware guy, and I don't expect/want to be spoon fed, but I need someone who knows what the hell they're talking about(unlike me) to give me a nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>For example in this screen, it tells me 48% so around 3.8G used, but if I sum everything I don't even reach 1G.</p>

"1427567","old 2009 iMac 27"" grey boot screen & black screen","<p>Sorry for the premature question posting; as explored in the comments, the problem manifested itself again by the screen going blank shortly after writing this post. <strong>Symptoms persisting after downgrading sort of burst the bubble on my theory of a software problem, and the more i read online the more it looked like a hardware issue.</strong> It's now 2 years later, and after having this computer sitting around my office, and not getting around to fixing it, I am thinking of junking it(and maybe trying to save the lcd). The closest i got to fixing it was watching some youtube videos like these:</p>
<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/GUc6UefiELQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apple imac black screen of death ( late 2009 i3 3.06ghz )</a></p>
<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/6BJGLFCigdA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Late 2009 iMac 27&quot; Video Card Repair — 4850 — 2nd Bake</a></p>
<p>...Supposedly you can fix the gpu in your oven, although it seemed like a big job i decided the problem was beyond me. ...and computers do get old and need to be replaced from time to time, so I guess this will just be mystery left unsolved(though I'm very suspicious of the graphics card).</p>
<h1>I'm leaving the original question below:</h1>
<p>Last summer I acquired an Apple iMac 27&quot; late 2009 model EMC 2309. It was being thrown out because it was no longer able to boot(<strong>would not pass the grey screen</strong>), and the owner decided to buy a newer one. The computer's death was not sudden, but rather became gradually worse over time, where more and more frequently the <strong>screen would suddenly go black</strong>, requiring reboot. However <strong>it was not until the previous owner tried to install High Sierra that the iMac died completely</strong>. I heard through the grapevine that this is a common problem with that vintage, and it was explained as the result of hardware failure in the graphics card, due to general old age...</p>
<p>I was not really satisfied with that explanation, and it didn't really seam right to me, so I decided to downgrade to Snow Leopard, and viola it booted and functioned normally. Since then <strong>I have upgraded to Mavericks and everything seems to be running fine</strong>. Safari is stuck on 7.0, but it turns out it will run Firefox 66.0, and many other apps that still support Mavericks.</p>
<p>I don't know what is more troubling, that someone would try to upgrade that old hardware to 10.13, or that the upgrade was done through the AppStore. What I am wondering is, since there is clearly nothing wrong with the hardware, <strong>why would Apple post an upgrade in the AppStore that will totally not work on your computer?</strong> Shouldn't there be some sort of supported-hardware list?</p>
<p><strong>Is this something special to this model? This computer? I suspect it's a similar story for other ~10 year old Apples.</strong></p>
<p>Things seam to be running smoothly now. Should I risk going up to Yosemite? Remember, it was not until Sierra that problems really started occurring. <strong>What features added in El Capitan and Sierra could be the cause of this problem?</strong></p>

One day, the hp came up with bsod. I considered: virus, memory, hd, os glitched, mobo.<br>
This is what I did as testing: in hp pc, new hd, fresh installed xp from cd. Install proceeded normally thru final reboot, then bsod. cold boot, restart, safe boot, all bsod.<br>
Didnt have mem stick or mobo, so tried fresh install on this new hd of win 7 pro, to test hardware, and all went well.<br>
Next, same hd, installed Ubuntu 17.10.1, no problems either.<br>
I'm thinking these two tests prove the hardware is ok.<br>
Next took the new hd to 2nd pc, one I built. Fresh installed win xp pro from same cd as before, install went well, no issues at all.<br>
Next, I put this hd into hp pc as-is, and tried to boot. BSOD.<br>
HD back in other pc, boots normally.<br>
Next, with my other pc up and running win xp pro on its own hd, I connected original bsod hp hd as external usb drive and tested it with scandisk, no errors, then for viruses with avira free. I got 85 hits trcrypt gen3 trojan, found in downloads from ms update and google update. cleared them, reran with no further hits.<br>
Put this hd back into hp pc and bsod!<br>
Question is, can mobo/bios rom be causing this due to xp, yet still run win 7 and ubuntu with no issues?<br>
Or????? HEEEEEEEElp!<br>
thanks, seekertom </p>

<p>2/6/18,adding bsod info: stop: 0x0000007B (0xBA4C3524, 0xC3524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</p>

<p>i replaced mem stick. its a single 4gb stick, and have tried it in either slot, still get bsod after windows completes last reboot. 
to restate, i've tried different hds and different install disks/keys.
what still strikes me is the fact that the new hd boots all during the install process, except for the final time.<br>
thanks again for the help!

Ok disks i said, i removed the power from the HDD which it has windows on it but i only use it for storage and everything booted absolutely fine. Then i traded sata cables, nothing then sata ports still nothing. Then i removed the ssd and tried the Hdd alone it stuck at windows logo then the preparing automatic repair so i had no way to get into windows even for backup. Then i used a known good usb stick with windows iso on it using uefi in order to get to safe mode or restoration from windows installation procedure, it boots on the ssd or when no disk is in the system, but when the HDD is on, oh boy, i tried legacy/bios and after the MB message it ignores the usb... I have to make it a priority boot every time, then i used uefi and thats the furthest I've gotten after booting from usb instead of showing the windows installation procedure it just shows a purple screen with my Mouse moving. how can a Hdd create so many problems</p>

     ""Feb_03_2017_Daily report.xls"",  ect....  </p>

<p>Each of the daily reports have multiple worksheets in them</p>

<p>What i would like to do is copy only the first sheet from each daily report and 
paste them into the Monthly report as their own worksheet with each worksheet labeled as ""Day 1"", ""Day 2"", ""Day 3"", respectavely</p>

<p>The monthly workbook is set up as<br>
Sheet 1 -- is my worksheet compiling the data from the daily reports.<br>
Sheet 2 -- is reserved for Day 1 data<br>
Sheet 3 -- is reserved for Day 2 data<br>
Sheet 4 -- is reserved for Day 3 date<br>
all the way thru sheet 32 for day 31 data.</p>

<p>All i need to is to import worksheet 1 from the ""Feb_01_2017_Daily report.xls"" into sheet 2 of ""Monthly report.xlxs""<br>
Then import worksheet 1 from the ""Feb_02_2017_Daily report.xls"" into sheet 3 of ""Monthly report.xlxs""<br>
Then import worksheet 1 from the ""Feb_03_2017_Daily report.xls"" into sheet 4 of ""Monthly report.xlxs""<br>
all the way thru for 31 days.</p>

<p>I do not want to copy any of the other sheets in the Daily reports -- only sheet 1</p>

<p>The main objective is to only have a single port (TCP 25565) facing the Internet, and then pass the request hostname (mc.example.com) to the right backend server.</p>
<p>Is there any way to achieve this? I know that a reverse proxy can be used, but it's for HTTP, so any way to do this for Minecraft?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> as @attie said, it won't be possible to use a single IF port for multiple Minecraft servers.</p>
<p>So now, let's say I open a range of 10 ports (25565 to 25575) for those servers. What should I do next to make this more user-friendly? I mean, directly redirecting the user to the IF port when he's entering mc.example.com?</p>

"1429649","SU Level Access Denied","<p>I’m a newbie to Linux and have been over sometime setting up a NAS box based on an old Iomega NAS box modifying the installed software, mostly successfully. I haven’t done anything with it for over a month other than using it for storage as planned and all has been working well for longer.</p>

<p>In the past week I hit a issue which highlighted my problem. I login in, OK, then try to change to SU, password requested but is says “su: Authentication failure”. I’m sure what the password is and using “John The Ripper” on the Shadow file confirmed that the password is correct. So unable to go to SU to fix issues.</p>

<p>In trying to sort a solution I tried SUDO, but unsure if this is set up to work. Result being “sudo: must be setuid root” so no progress.</p>

<p>I’ve managed to find out that the permissions for SU in /bin/ is “-rwxr-xr-x 1 root nogroup 24480 1970-01-01 01:00 su” and SUDO in /usr/bin is “-rwxr-xr-x 2 root nogroup 110540 1970-01-01 01:01 sudo” I can’t find if SU is correct, but wonder if it should be –rwsr-xr-x. I understand the SUDO should be –rwsr-xr-x, but I can not set with chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo result “chmod: changing permissions of `/usr/bin/sudo': Operation not permitted”. If I try sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo the result is “sudo: must be setuid root”. This may be a side track but its a dead end.</p>

<p>Last mod I did in the system was over a month ago and in the data section only of the NAS box, I mass changed all permissions on the data to 777. Only on the data storage area not any of the Linux folders. The data storage area is called NAS and lives in the root. Otherwise I do not know what has happened.</p>

<p>As to the actual question. Can anyone indicate what may have happened and more to the point how to sort and return SU level access again? The system is an Embedded Linux so headless and I use a Telnet connection to change everything, but Windows Explorer to explore and search areas.</p>

<p>My last idea is to remove the disk and place in a USB hard disk box and access via a VM Ubuntu installation. Then change the permissions to SUDO to –rwsr-xr-x if possible and if I can find out what SU should be change it’s permissions to suit, both using the VM’s chmod command. Can this be done?</p>

<p>Any help REALLY appreciated, thanks.</p>

<p>Update</p>

<p>Thanks for the confirmation offered in the second answer by Scott. If anyone has an alternative to re-instate the sticky bit with chmod I would appreciate it, otherwise I have to remove the disk as indicated, possible later this week on next weekend, so please comment, thanks.</p>

"1431383","Why can I not connect to my Kali Wifi Hotspot?","<p>I'm trying to do a bit of a hackish workaround. 
I have a raspberry Pi 3B+ running Kali Linux which is connected to my corporate network over ethernet. I also have a windows machine on the same network. 
I am able to drive the Pi over SSH and through a VNC viewer. This works fine. </p>

<p>However, I need to move files between the two machines easily so I can use it as a test rig for cross-platform deployments. Due to security restrictions of the network I cannot view shared folders from the windows machine.</p>

<p>My workaround for this is to use a Pi Zero W and this little hack... 
<a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-zero-w-smart-usb-flash-drive/?fbclid=IwAR1GbWFUUhoGW8_enGVy9vwQLo-83pPKYnG_fsgZ1_uKuM75lq7bNw9PW6E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-zero-w-smart-usb-flash-drive/?fbclid=IwAR1GbWFUUhoGW8_enGVy9vwQLo-83pPKYnG_fsgZ1_uKuM75lq7bNw9PW6E</a></p>

<p>So the zero W side works nicely, and I've been able to put it to use at home. 
I'm now trying to get my kali device to host a wireless hotspot and have the zero W connect to it, whilst having the USB side of the zero plugged into my windows machine to facilitate file sharing. </p>

<p>""Wu Tang Lan"" is my home network, ""Network USB Host"" is the network I am trying to run from the Kali device, and ""Malware Propogation Test"" is a hotspot hosted on my android phone. </p>

<p>My /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
    ssid=Wu Tang Lan""
    psk=""InsertHomeWifiPasswordHere""
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

network={
    ssid=Network USB Host""
    psk=""PiFileShare""
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

network={
    ssid=""Malware Propogation Test""
    psk=""ThePasswordToThisNetwork""
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
</code></pre>

<p>The device connects automatically to the first and third networks without an issue, but will not connect to the USB Host network. </p>

<p>My phone can see the USB host network but when I try to connect it either doesn't connect at all, or endlessly disconnects and reconnects until the option reads 'disabled' in my list of networks. </p>

<p>My Kali Network configuration for the USB Host network looks like this:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/pujId.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/pujId.png"" alt=""General""></a>

"1295395","Evil Twin Access Point? Am I being hacked? Two identical wifi routers","<p>I have noticed that when I go to connect to my wifi on my home network, a new Wifi appeared with identical signal strength but with the addition of the number 2 in the wifi name.   Both are encrypted wireless networks and both have the same password but different mac addresses...</p>

<p>What's bizarre is that it only appears on one computer (mine) that is connected to the router (2WIRE237).   </p>

<p>I have checked three other computers on the same network, and 2WIRE237 2 does not appear.  In addition, although 2WIRE237 2 is ""secure"" (see photo), for some reason my computer automatically knows the password.  I can connect to 2WIRE237 2; meanwhile, the network does not appear for anyone else using the network.  Why?     </p>

<p>Keeping in mind, the Wifi network 2WIRE237 2 has never been implemented....there has never been a ""2WIRE237 2"" as the router name.   It has always been ""2WIRE237"".     </p>

What programs are user friendly to determine this?   I have downloaded EVILAPDEFENDER; however, I am not a technology genius and I do not know how to install the program or run python.  </p>

So each time I connect I have to click on the ""Not for this site"" button.</p>

"1295933","HDD Abnormalities","<p>I am pretty sure that my HDD is broken, but tests after show that it is mostly fine.  About 1 month ago, my HDD clicked about 10 times on Windows 10 boot, this corrupted the boot sector of every operating system that I had on my disk.  Windows 10 was no longer viewed as a valid operating system, only booted into BSOD. Ubuntu loads grub, and then freezes half way through loading the kernel. And practically every other OS that I have on my disk does these two things now. The HDD has never clicked before this, and never has clicked since.</p>

<p>The Hard Disk is 4 years old, as well as the system it is running on. There was 0 indication other than the corruption, that there is anything wrong with the disk. The system is a Toshiba Satellite S50-A.</p>

<p><strong>But my big question</strong> is if this is a problem with my Motherboard, a problem with the cabling/connection, a problem with the HDD, or just a once off issue. Because I went out and bought a new 500GB Samsung SSD, and I need to know if I can put it in my system, without it damaging the drive (due to possible motherboard/connection issues).</p>

<p>I have done disk benchmarks via, pulling the information off of the disk after the Operating Systems became corrupt, and by doing multiple Ubuntu Disks Benchmarks.  The ~600GB of files transfered in a time of ~9 days, to a brand new 1TB USB3.0 HDD backup drive (Seagate Backup Plus Portable Drive SRD00F1).  The External Drive was definitely not the issue. And all of the Files, except for specific folders in the Windows Folder and the boot sectors of the Operating Systems, were NOT corrupted.</p>

<p>The most I've been able to achieve downloading through FTP/SFTP is 100mbit. Even if I download 2 files or 10 files at once. it caps at 100mbit.
<strong>However</strong>, if I use two programs at the same time on the same computer (for example FileZilla and WinSCP) it bumps up to around 17-20MB/s. So obviously the computer isn't the bottleneck.  Downloading through HTTP or on steam can easily reach over 30MB/s.</p>

<p>I'm using the basic installation of both FileZilla and WinSCP but bumped up the simultaneous downloads to 10 (doesn't matter what I have).  I've tried on three computers. One wireless windows, one wired windows and one wireless mac and they all have the same issue.  What can I do to utilize the full speed of my internet when I download through SFTP/FTP?

Then I would need the average of the next 2 rows of data with the same criteria. Then I would do the same to find the average where ID = 1 and Color = Blue. Then I would do the same where ID = 2 and Color = Red. </p>

<p>Normally I would do an averageifs formula but since I only need the first X rows of data to be averaged then I'm not sure how to tackle this problem. One additional caveat is that not every ID has an equal number of data points. So ID 1 Color Red could have 4 data points while ID 2 Color Blue could have 6 data points.

"1296822","Ram Disk for encrypting files much faster","<p>I have a lot of medium to small files (1gb in total) to encrypt several times a week. I often decrypt out of windows EFS then encrypt using another method. In doing so on a new fast SSD it can take 14 mins 23 secs to complete each time. However using a Ramdisk (UltraRAMDisk-Lite-1.65) 1.5 gb on size the same pc it managed it in a whopping 3 mins 30 secs. </p>

<p>The benchmark for the Ramdisk was far greater than even intel's 3d optane. So why would anyone ever need intel's upgrade when speed is often only needed for just some tasks. I get get that performance for free with Ramdisk. But a larger question is why hasn't windows got settings to use hardware automatically in this way? When to increase performance take little effort with what we have had for years. Then the pc can backup to ssd at leisure after the users/tasks input is finished.    </p>

I have go through the code, Idk what went wrong  </p>

<p>I now looping through the Sheet1 to see if its match the columns in Xsheet.<br>
4566, it matches 'Adam' in name col (since it's name <strong>or</strong> description so if name matches then it's a match), and (need to be) active, so its in.<br>
4899, Edward is a match (or whatever description), but did not match <strong>and</strong> active, so no.<br>
4987, same case as 4566, its Adam and active.<br>
4988, Kris (not a match name), but al is in Xsheet's description, and active, so it's in.<br>
4989, Chris not a match name, ttr not a match description, even its an active case (I also wont take it in)</p>

<p>I already checked the drive using SMART, <code>chkdsk</code>, <code>Fight Flash Fraud</code> and <code>clamav</code>. No errors at all. I also checked the hardware thoroughly and cannot find any problems.</p>

<p>But there are some odd problems on the drive which I cannot figure out:</p>

<p>When I mount the drive from linux and try to read the content using <code>tar</code>, I get a lot of messages like these: </p>

<p>This error leads to installing ntfs-3g-compressed, which does not exist any more and should be included into ntfs-3g... So the cause is something else. </p>

<p>Now I tried to copy the content from a different Windows 10 installation (in VirtualBox). Windows tells me ""unexpected error 0x80070032"" which is totally unrelated to copying files. according to microsoft: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This error code is triggered when you try to set an external hard disk
  as your backup location. The issue can also occur when you're trying
  to install a major update to your Windows 10. The update relies on
  files that can be accessed from a direct download from Microsoft or 
  an automatic update through the Windows Update. The error code
  0x80070032 arises when you are trying to activate the Automatic File
  Backups setting. This option is located in the settings menu under the
  backup option. When you restart your PC to accept the changes made,
  the update fails to activate, thus the error code 0x80070032 appears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How come <code>chkdsk</code> does not find any error even if run with <code>/r</code>?</p>

<p>I recently replaced the power cord to SATA drive, but this did not help. Might the bad power cable have caused the filesystem mess?</p>

I tried ROBOCOPY, mirroring an empty folder, but it fails, because there's too many folders. It's not a huge problem but it annoys me a lot. I wrote a Java program to make them, just for fun, so... yeah. Any suggestions?
I would rather not reformat my hard drive, but that would probably work, because it's on my secondary drive.</p>

<p>Edit: Deleting the parent folder does nothing, even permanently deleting, ie no recycling bin. </p>

<p>Edit: Dual booting into Linux Mint and deleting the parent folder just moves it to the trash. Linux can not delete the folder either, because of file name length.</p>

<p>Edit: using the del \s \q *.* command doesn't work because it doesn't delete anything. Same result with just *.</p>

I would like to add the option to do this into the context menus for files and for folders. </p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://www.ghacks.net/2017/07/18/how-to-delete-large-folders-in-windows-super-fast/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> tutorial that shows to create a .bat file and add it to the registry, however when I try to use it nothing happens, I did manage to get the option to appear in the context menu by adding the key to <strong>Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT*\shell\Fast Delete\command</strong> instead of the <strong>Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\Fast Delete\command</strong> like it says in the tutorial, although when I try to use it from the right click nothing happens.</p>

<p>The .bat file is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@ECHO OFF
ECHO Delete Folder: %CD%?
PAUSE
SET FOLDER=%CD%
CD /
DEL /F/Q/S ""%FOLDER%"" &gt; NUL
RMDIR /Q/S ""%FOLDER%""
EXIT
</code></pre>

<p>and the location of the .bat file is <strong>""C:\Extra Windows Tools\delete.bat""</strong> i did add **""C:\Extra Windows Tools** to the system path variable.</p>

<p>I have tried using <strong>cmd /c ""cd %1 &amp;&amp; delete.bat""</strong> like the tutorial says and nothing happens I have also tried <strong>""C:\Extra Windows Tools\delete.bat"" %1</strong>, that I found on another website.</p>

<p>Any help that you can give will be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>*Edit 1
The problem is partly to do with permissions and partly because it doesnt seem to work when i right click on folders only on files. with the permissions problems i go through <a href=""http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-failed-to-enumerate-objects-in-the-container"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these</a> steps which allows me to delete files using the normal delete option but not with the batch script.</p>

<p>*Edit 2 - I have sorted the permissions, the problem is because the script doesnt seem to work on folders</p>

<p>*Edit 3 - I have fixed the problem, i added the key with the suggestion below to <strong>Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\Fast Delete</strong> and it now works on folders. Thank you for all your suggestions</p>

<p>In case this is confusing (which I suspect it is), Windows tells you that a 100MB file is equal to 104,857,600 bytes (rather than 100,000,000) because it thinks 1 kB = 1024 bytes. While there is confusion among many experts about if this is correct I think that this is ugly, regardless of whether it's correct. I want it to show me 100,000,000 bytes.</p>

<p>The logon screen displays the old Domain Name\former user name. I have tried my last known password without success and also tried inserting no password. No Admin option is displayed and trying Admin and Administrator as alternative users (with and without possible passwords) does not work. </p>

<p>I used HIRENS BOOT DISC (burned to CD because the Vaio has no CD drive and Vista is on the HDD) and removed the password for my old user name (the Administrator password is protected) but that did not work and I only realised afterwards that once my password had been deleted it cannot be changed so I used ""Mini XP"" on Hirens to insert a new Administrator User under another totally different name and password</p>

<p>According to Hirens the log=on screen should have shown my new user but  before I even got so far as that Windows had to repair itself (to a last known good point).  </p>

<p>My only remaining thought is that the Vaio might want a password for the old Domain (none of which I ever knew because my IT was outsourced). so I wonder if I can persuade my Vaio it is no longer part of my old Domain, or remove it from it, will that make it possible to sort out the problem of the missing passwords? </p>

<p>Basically what she needs is to type the item name, then have it set every occurrence of that items quantity to the new number.</p>

<p>For example: [bags][8] needs to be changed to 7, so every occurrence where there's <code>bags</code> it needs to change its quantity to 7 to look like [bags][7].</p>

<p>If more information is needed please let me know. Thanks.</p>

When I select two side printing, I get the option how to turn the page, either like a book or ""upwards"". If we have a A4 (letter) page, it means on long edge (like a book) or short edge (upwards).
This is at least the theory I understood.</p>

I actually installed Windows 10 to play games, but it seems like disk and CPU usage is almost full. I have tried to optimize it, but it just doesn't seem to work. New driver updates were the only thing that I actually did, since there were no applications that were consuming my CPU. Games that I play don't run smooth, but it works just fine on windows 8.1, the OS that I use for work. I'll edit this post and put up some links, since I don't have much reputation, as I am now at work and booting literally takes a whole minute, as it loads up the boot manager of windows 8.1 and then restart, and then it arrives at the windows 10 login screen.

<p>I think this problem might originate from windows 10 bugs, but I am not entirely sure. My PC runs on legacy, MBR table, and I had recently changed it from UEFI GPT table to MBR, Legacy boot.</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 10 would always run slow, let's forget about the boot time for now.</li>
<li>Well, programs open up fast, but they <strong>do not</strong> run smooth.</li>
<li>I had just installed Windows 10, after formatting my PC and along with it, Windows 8.1</li>
<li>Well, I am currently booted up in Windows 8.1, I'll answer this question after sometime</li>
<li>When running windows 10, it definitely does not run hot.</li>
<li>The ROM is actually a HDD, the laptops back in 2015, or something, and I have installed it on the HDD, by giving it a decent amount of space.</li>
<li>I know the fact that my Windows 10 has the latest update: 20H2</li>

However, no matter what I do (install Win7, Win10, clone Win7) the OS won't boot from that drive (I could boot to a system through the bootable USB). I suspect the problem lies in one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Faulty drive.</li>
<li>BIOS problem</li>
<li>Boot problem</li>
</ol>

<p>I have no idea which one it may be, so I'll explain what I did and what results it brought me. So far I've been at it a total of 12 hours, non-stop, so the early details are a bit hazy. After some point, most of the images were created using <a href=""https://rufus.akeo.ie/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rufus 2.18</a>. I have two cables that attach the drives and I'd sporadically switch between them.</p>

<p><strong>IN ALL CASES, IF NEEDED, I CAN REPEAT ALL THESE STEPS TO EXACTLY IDENTIFY THE RESULTS AND TAKE PICTURES FROM THE VARIOUS BOOTABLE FIX TOOLS</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>The computer is about 7 years old, here's it's relevant hardware:
Asrock P55 Deluxe3
Nvidia GTX 460
8 gb of ram
Intel Core i5 760, 2.8 GHz</p>

<p>Original disk is 120GB, Toshiba, it has a dual boot with Win7 and Ubuntu 16.04 which was hard to install. I think I first installed Ubuntu 14.04 and only then added the Win7 which created various boot problems but I was able to ""fix"" them. I also own a laptop with dual win7-ubuntu 14.04.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>WINDOWS 7</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/NkYaI.png"" alt=""Creating USB with Rufus""></p>

<p>First, I tried to install a Windows 7 Professional from a bootable USB. I created a bootable USB and ran it without a problem. Created a partition from half of the drive and chose to install Win7 on it. At one point it says it will restart to continue the installation and I agree (if there is a prompt to agree too, not just information). It restarts, however, when booting I was getting a ""no such device XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX..."" error and was being booted to grub. Not sure what order, but I tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>I tried using <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair/home/Home/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this boot-repair tool</a>. If I remember correctly, it got rid of the ""no such device"" problem but led to ""Reboot and select proper Boot Device
or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device"" screen.</li>
<li>The Windows 7 bootable USB repair, which when completed successfully either didn't change anything or had the exact same result as 1.</li>
<li>Through the Win7 bootable usb, using the command prompt I tried doing a bcdboot and bootrec /rebuildbcd, not sure what were the results.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point I was rather resigned, but I noticed one thing: <em>when booting through the USB, I got a message of ""Press any key to boot from the USB"", however, if I didn't press any button, it would boot me to a working, new Windows 7</em></p>

<p>Bizzare. I don't think I created a live USB. I can't say for sure if I went to see if it was on a disk, but I think I did and am fairly certain it was the installation from the disk.</p>

<p>However, I had problems downloading a Win7 image from MS, I torrented one since I have an MSDNAA license for my studies and the working Win7 is legal. I simply decided I'd deal with key issues once I had it installed. Since the ISO wasn't exactly official, I decided to get a Win10 key and an official image.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Windows 10</strong></p>

<p>I installed the Win10 on the USB drive the same way I did with Win7. I deleted the existing partition, restarted the computer and installed Win10. After the installation exactly the same problem appeared as with the Win7. I tried the same solutions as with Win7 and I can't remember exactly as it was yesterday and I'm dead tired, but I think the solutions and results were largely the same.</p>

<p>And again, I was able to boot into Windows 10 by booting into the USB and not pressing a key.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Clone of Windows 7</strong></p>

<p>Since I couldn't get a new system to boot correctly, and since it worked, I decided I'd clone my existing Win7.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/oNUG8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/oNUG8.png"" alt=""Here are the drives after the second cloning""></a></p>

<p>Bear in mind the difference in System Reserved partitions appeared only after attempting to fix it. The size difference in primary partitions existed upon cloning, I assume due to </p>

<p>The MX500 SSD comes with an Acronis True Image for Crucial software. However, the GUI was a bit tedious and confusing to use, so I decided to use Macrium Reflect.</p>

<p>The cloning went as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>I choose to clone Disk 1</li>
<li>I choose the new disk as the recipient</li>
<li>I uncheck the Ubuntu partitions</li>
<li>I resize the primary partition to be bigger (only on first try, on second try I left it as is)</li>
<li>I clone with options Intelligent Sector Copy (meaning only used sectors will be copied, I suspect this is the reason the copied primary partition is smaller) and Enable SSD Trim.</li>
</ol>

<p>The cloning is successful. After reboot, with both disks present, the computer boots into the original drive. I only see the original boot choices, so I stupidly assume I need to add the boots from the second drive. I don't exactly remember how, but through the command prompt from the win10 installation USB, I add the boot choices to achieve the following:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/q4jSa.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/q4jSa.jpg"" alt=""Notice the sdb1 &amp; sdb2 which wasn&#39;t there before""></a></p>

<p>Windows only boots from sda2 and sdb2 partitions. Notice, that when attempting to fix the boot problems of the original system (long time ago, no idea how or what happened) a boot option was added to the System Reserve partition which, I think, redirects to the boot menu and only sda2 is the proper boot.</p>

<p>When I set the MX500 as the main boot drive and remove all other bootable devices, it simply states:</p>

<p><em>""Reboot and select proper Boot Device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device""</em></p>

<p>However, if I have a Win7 bootable USB inserted, I can do one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boot the clone drive, which simply boots to the USB</li>
<li>Boot the USB, and upon not pressing any keys, nothing happens (as opposed to previously booting into Win7/10).</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, I attempt to fix the boot using one of the following methods, I don't remember the order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Win7 boot repair. Upon hitting ""Repair current system"" it says that there's a boot problem and a prompt appears asking me to agree to fixing the problem and restarting the system. I agree and the action fails. The tool doesn't find a windows OS, I go to the choose a tool screen. The USB system doesn't find a drive, it says ""Unknown"". I start the command prompt and try: <code>bcdboot D:\Windows /s C:</code>. It says the operation succeeded. Nothing changes.</li>
<li>I use the boot-repair tool. Doesn't fix anything. Pastebin from it <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/dxmWMvqSmr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">today</a>, <a href=""http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/RtT2NQjd6H/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">yesterday, with both disks attached</a>.</li>
<li>I create a bootable USB with the Macrium Reflect Rescue Media </li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ESePk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ESePk.png"" alt=""Rescue Media""></a></p>

<p>I boot into it and it sees the drive and the system and I choose to completely rebuild the boot. Including the MBR, etc. It does so, nothing changes when trying to boot.</p>

<p>This morning I tried to clone the disk without chaning the partition size, I did the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both drives are attached.</li>
<li>Copy two partitions from original to empty without changing anything.</li>
<li>Clone.</li>
<li>Restart the computer.</li>
<li>Detach original drive, put new drive with clone into it's SATA cable.</li>
<li>Start system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Doesn't work, again, asks to insert a bootable device. </p>

<hr>

<p>Now, I'm desperate. I don't know how to fix this. Any ideas? Only things I think could maybe somehow work better are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a clone using Acronis True Image and hope it just works.</li>
<li>Do some boot device magic through the command prompt that I just don't know how to do and is a bit beyond my abilities.</li>
<li>Reinstall/reset the BIOS which I think may be partly responsible.</li>
<li>Find another tool to fix the boot.</li>
<li>Install Ubuntu first</li>
<li>Clone the entire drive, along with Ubuntu and unused sectors</li>
<li>Drive is faulty, check for faultyness.</li>
</ol>

<p>All suggestions are welcome. I can try and attempt anything, provide any extra information.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Random things that happened but I don't remember when, updated as I recollect them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Missing boot manager after booting</li>
<li>Used Easy BCD 2.3, which resulted in both drives not being bootable. I think boot-repair fixed it.</li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT2: Interesting developments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Installed Ubuntu 16.04 with no additional shenanigans. It didn't boot again, but I was able to (don't exactly remember how) add an option to my old drives grub to boot that system and it worked. However, if I removed the old disk, it would again boot to the ""Reboot and select a proper boot device"" screen.</li>
<li><strong>Desperate to fix my problem, I decided to determine if the problem lies in the drive. I took out the SSD in my laptop and attempted to install ubuntu 16.04 on the new drive. Since the laptop uses an EFI partition, when installing I created 3 partitions: 1gb logical efi partition, 245gb primary ext4 partition and a 4gb swap area. After installation I reboot the laptop and the system booted into ubuntu without a problem. This means that the problem either lies in the hardware of my computer or the BIOS.</strong></li>

<p>The BIOS (InsydeH20 1.10 rev 3.5) provides no HAV/VMX/Virtualization options. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is HAV necessary for 64-bit Windows 7 to run, or just for VM/XP mode stuff (which I don't do)?</li>
<li>Is there any point in installing 64-bit Windows 7 on a machine this under-powered?</li>

"1305783","Battery not charging, laptop only works when plugged","<p>Yesterday my battery was working fine (for an old computer). It could sustain a normal usage for three hours at least. Today I have the following symptomas:</p>
<ul>
<li>I noticed that it didn't charge, even though it is written &quot;plugged, charging&quot;. The level stays at 61%.</li>
<li>If I unplug the laptop, it shutdowns immediately and brutally, just as if there was no battery at all in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just before I noticed the problem, I changed the power plan from balanced to powerful, then to balanced again.</p>
<p>I believe the battery is not the problem, or at least it is not the normal old battery die-out because it is so sudden. Not a slow death. Do you think it could be some settings that I changed wrongly?</p>
<p>The computer is a Sony Vaio VPCSA from 2012. The battery is the original.</p>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>I did the test proposed by @Joe Taylor and got the following results:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/mkZdc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mkZdc.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Can I conclude anything from it? Is another part of it important?</p>
<p>I also checked the VAIO control center for battery health, and got all green:</p>

<h3>Edit 2</h3>
<p>Based on @DrMoishe Pippik answer, I followed the Vaio troubleshooting checklist. What solved the problem was to remove and replug the battery. I don’t know if this reset some parameters, or if it had moved or if there was some dust, but now it’s working again. <strong>Long life to my old Vaio!</strong></p>

"1199613","windows 10 latency - different results performance monitor vs latencymon","<p>I tried to solve the latency issue myself by updating drivers etc.  tried all the methods/varients of drivers using the easydriver update tool, but latency is still continuing.</p>

<p>I have used the latencymon and the windows performance monitor tool too, but unable to figure out the issue.  Could you please help me out.  High dpc is showing at ntoskrnl., next to it is vsdatant (zone alarm I suppose); way behind them is nvlddmkm (number is small so not an issue I think).</p>

<p>But according to latency mon -the higest execution time is for tcpip and ndis.sys.  So not able to figure out what the cause is</p>

<p>System configuration:
Windows 10
AMD phenom 2 X4 945
Gigabyte GT 730 - 2GB DDR5
Mb = M5A78L M Plus usb3</p>

<p>EDIT:
I have just now tested with USB LAN adapter, to my surprise even this is having the same issue.  The issue is coming only when I make use of internet.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<hr>

<p>Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. Also one or more ISR routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. At least one detected problem appears to be network related. In case you are using a WLAN adapter, try disabling it to get better results. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates. 
LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for  0:01:49  (h:mm:ss) on all processors.</p>

<p>MEASURED INTERRUPT TO USER PROCESS LATENCIES</p>

<hr>

<p>The interrupt to process latency reflects the measured interval that a usermode process needed to respond to a hardware request from the moment the interrupt service routine started execution. This includes the scheduling and execution of a DPC routine, the signaling of an event and the waking up of a usermode thread from an idle wait state in response to that event.</p>

<p>REPORTED HARD PAGEFAULTS</p>

<hr>

<p>Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted and blocked from execution.</p>

<p>NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.</p>

<p>Process with highest pagefault count:                 firefox.exe</p>

<p>Total number of hard pagefaults                       94

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/09yHC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/09yHC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I tried it at my place before giving it to my girlfriend nothing of this sort happened. At her place we discovered that when I touch the metal part of it a continuous current flows through me. She had it for weeks now, and it doesn't happen to her. The current is strong enough to cause pain to my finger. She and her mother feel nothing when they touch it. If I try to ground myself with the metal PC case, nothing changes.</p>

<p>For my girlfriend and her mother a voltmeter measures like 0.01 or 0.00 volts between them and the metal part. Between me and the metal part of the keyboard it goes to like 2.5 volts. It doesn't seem to be affected really by socks or flippers or if we're sitting on a chair etc. but to be honest I didn't focus on checking and eliminating such factors.</p>

<p>This not only happens with the keyboard. There's a headphone jack (a metal ring) on her front left speaker. It zaps me as well (it always did but I never gave it much thought until now) when I accidentally touch it. I measured around 2.5 volts between it and me, on my girlfriend, next to nothing. When I touch it however the initial shock stings so much that I can't keep touching it, so it seems it supplies a stronger current than the keyboard.</p>

<p>What could explain the voltage drop happening only relative to me, and the resulting current I feel when touching the keyboard?</p>

But it doesn't take, as mine being home edition.</p>
<p>Also at Microsoft website, where I download the image, I see a message &quot;This VM will expire on 1/10/21.&quot; So, what's after? I am using it for personal learning purpose only. Is there a way to get permanent copy?</p>
<p>Or is there a better location that I can download the image, never expires? Student version/personal learning. Any suggestions really appreciated.</p>

<p><code>energy_now</code> is 95% of <code>energy_full</code>, which in turns is 85% of <code>energy_full_design</code>. This doesn't sound like an end-of-life battery, but still acts like one. The main problem seems to be that <code>capacity_level:Critical</code>, but nothing else looks alarming from my understanding.</p>

<p>So is it possible that maybe the computer didn't charge the battery somehow and that reported numbers are plain wrong, or that the battery wrongfully reports a critical level preventing the computer to power on?</p>

<p>My surface pro 3 keyboard stopped working, and I took it to the service center. They said they found the problem, my computer is missing the Surface Type Cover Filter Device driver. They also wrote down the <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MS website</a> where I could find the driver. However you will notice, all that can be seen is this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/5TNdV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5TNdV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It's just a bunch of confusing/ prosaic sounding updates. There is no way of knowing where the driver I need is supposed to be.</p>

<p>While googling what to do, the consensus appears to be that you should uninstall the driver, restart the surface pro and it will automatically reinstall the driver. My issues with that are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Surface Type cover Filter Device does not appear in my device manager</li>
<li>After shutting down and restarting, the driver is not installed</li>
<li>Volume up and power button for 10 seconds also does not install the missing driver</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd rather not interact with the service center again.</p>

<p>If someone knows where I can get a stand alone copy of Surface Type Cover Filter Device, that would be great.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>Over a week later, I still can't get the driver back. I ran into another issue, where whenever my Surface Pro 3 finishes installing the update from the MS website and prompts me to restart, it freezes each and every time. I humored it and let it try to complete, but it was unresponsive for 2 hours. It simply says: ""Surface"". Nothing else. At which point I have to volume button + power to revive it. </p>

<p>Is there some way to download a specific driver (in my case: Surface Type Cover Filter Device driver) and apply it without the Surface needing to restart? I have had bad luck whenever prompted to restart. The options in Device Manager seem very limited, there is no way to have it search for missing drivers. I also have a sinking feeling it doesn't even detect that it is missing a driver for my keyboard. Is there something else I can do?</p>

<p>I have 2 columns of different length.  </p>

<p>In the below Do While loop,</p>

<pre><code>Do While main.Offset(i, 0).Value &lt;&gt; """" Or main.Offset(i, 1).Value &lt;&gt; """"
</code></pre>

<p>using OR, it generates tons of irrelevant data (like not matching name/tag in sheet2) so I change to AND, it works perfectly Only if both columns end at the same row. (although there are duplicates, but they wasn't my main concern now)</p>

<pre><code>Do While main.Offset(i, 0).Value &lt;&gt; """" And main.Offset(i, 1).Value &lt;&gt; """"
</code></pre>

<p>But using the logical operator 'And', it stops halfway ( if one of the column is shorter than the other.
Can any expert shed some light on how to get the data even when one column is shorter than another? </p>

<p>I tried to add parenthesis between both statements, put one of the column in another sheet, or create a nested do while loop, the data still remain the same.
I also tried the below code, but it gives all irrelevant data like ""Ken, summer,wendy"" in sheet2.</p>

<pre><code>Do While (main.Offset(i, 0).Value &lt;&gt; """" And main.Offset(i, 1).Value &lt;&gt; """") Or (main.Offset(i, 0).Value &lt;&gt; """" And main.Offset(i, 1).Value = """")
</code></pre>

<p>so I was wondering what I could use to replace the And operator and gives me correct results?</p>

I need to programmatically force Windows to stop immediately, regardless of the potential for data loss, or risk that the PC might not boot again.  Normally to forcefully stop Windows, I would either hold the power or reset button down for > 10 seconds, remove the battery or AC power.  </p>

<p><strong>Unless absolutely necessary, please explain to users that they should never force a Windows shutdown or reboot. Or, if they do, explain the risks of lost files or failure to boot.</strong></p>

<p>When would I need this?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows can't shut down some process</strong> - It ignores any ""Quit Windows"" commands.</li>
<li><strong>System is so busy and slow</strong>, it will (almost) never finish shutting down and:</li>
<li>... ---> <strong>The mouse or keyboard is almost frozen</strong> and it takes 5 minutes to even try to initiate power commands.</li>
<li>... ---> <strong>Windows will likely take an hour to finish</strong> a coordinated and safe shutdown or reboot.</li>
<li><strong>It is physically impossible to press reset or remove AC/DC power from PC, since I'm not at the PC.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Malware appears to be actively encrypting files</strong> or popping up an infinite number of new windows.</li>

<p>I read afterwards with reset the he might not know which user owns what.</p>

<p>When I run icacls reset again after, I deleted 2nd User and Admin, then it is technically like before only my original user left. So after deleting all other users it should be more clear that he owns everything what is possible to own as normal user, and everything higher maybe for administrator or UAC style, meaning no own admin account only elevating kinda standard user for several tasks to admin?</p>

# Replication Slave (comment out master section to use this)
#
# To configure this host as a replication slave, you can choose between
# two methods :
#
# 1) Use the CHANGE MASTER TO command (fully described in our manual) -
#    the syntax is:
#
#    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=&lt;host&gt;, MASTER_PORT=&lt;port&gt;,
#    MASTER_USER=&lt;user&gt;, MASTER_PASSWORD=&lt;password&gt; ;
#
#    where you replace &lt;host&gt;, &lt;user&gt;, &lt;password&gt; by quoted strings and
#    &lt;port&gt; by the master's port number (3306 by default).
#
#    Example:
#
#    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='125.564.12.1', MASTER_PORT=3306,
#    MASTER_USER='joe', MASTER_PASSWORD='secret';
#
# OR
#
# 2) Set the variables below. However, in case you choose this method, then
#    start replication for the first time (even unsuccessfully, for example
#    if you mistyped the password in master-password and the slave fails to
#    connect), the slave will create a master.info file, and any later
#    change in this file to the variables' values below will be ignored and
#    overridden by the content of the master.info file, unless you shutdown
#    the slave server, delete master.info and restart the slaver server.
#    For that reason, you may want to leave the lines below untouched
#    (commented) and instead use CHANGE MASTER TO (see above)
#
# required unique id between 2 and 2^32 - 1
# (and different from the master)
# defaults to 2 if master-host is set
# but will not function as a slave if omitted
#server-id       = 2
#
# The replication master for this slave - required
#master-host     =   &lt;hostname&gt;
#
# The username the slave will use for authentication when connecting
# to the master - required
#master-user     =   &lt;username&gt;
#
# The password the slave will authenticate with when connecting to
# the master - required
#master-password =   &lt;password&gt;
#
# The port the master is listening on.
# optional - defaults to 3306
#master-port     =  &lt;port&gt;

<p>When running <code>badblocks</code> in destructive mode (i.e. with the <code>-w</code> switch), I get the error:</p>

<p>As can be seen, this also results in a false positive of a bad block, whereas this supposed bad block is nowhere to be found via CrystalDiskInfo:</p>

<p>At this point the drive has been zeroed multiple times and had <code>badblocks</code> write to its last few blocks tens of times, so there's been plenty of opportunity for the SMART values to have picked up a bad sector in block <code>1953525168</code> if one existed.</p>

<p>Outlook is slow to search, slow to index and sometimes when closed has to go through ""verifying data integrity"" which can take hours.</p>

<p>I suspect ideally that I'd be switching the system over to exchange and offloading this stuff to a server, but we're a small office and I'm the sole IT guy (and it's not even actually my job) so there's not really scope for this. Also this is the boss's computer and he's resistant to any kind of (visible) change.</p>

<p>I think the machine has 4gb of RAM but it's only used for very light-duty stuff - typically there'll be a spreadsheet or two, a word doc and a PDF or two open along with outlook. I could add more RAM if this is likely to be a limiting factor. I think the machine is about 5 years old and suspect it has a mid-range i3 or similar dual-core Pentium G[xxxx] processor.</p>

<p>All this in mind, will switching this PC to an SSD (was thinking an M.2 with a PCIe adaptor to get around 3000mb/s read speed) help with outlook search/indexing/verifying performance, or is the bottleneck likely to be elsewhere?</p>

Very soon I discovered very unpleasant thing: my default browser, MS Edge, can't remember any cookie on any website. You log in to, let say, GMail, do all the staff to read/write emails, then close the tab. One second later you decide to go back to gmail again and woops! You have to login again. Even if you have logged in, open the same website in the next tab and no cookies again, you have to re-authenticate again.</p>

<p>Indeed first idea was about wrong settings. However, I clearly see ""Don't block cookies"" at ""Privacy &amp; Security"". (and if I switch to ""Block all cookies"", I don't have any auth working at all, as expected). Googling gave noting so far but dummy texts/videos about ""Don't block cookies"" combobox which I have in correct position already, both in UI and system registry.</p>

<p>My Microsoft Edge is v44.18362.1.0 (previous PC was on v.42 and it was working perfectly OK)</p>

<p>The ""show your bookmarks"" icon is above the green arrow (which I screenshot from a different computer that is not having this problem and happens to be Firefox 59.0.2 on Ubuntu 16.04) is as pictured.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MNabB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MNabB.png"" alt=""picture 1""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/rSotk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/rSotk.png"" alt=""picture 2""></a></p>

<p>To create this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>uninstall Firefox, </li>
<li>re-install Firefox, </li>
<li>invoke Firefox and observe that the ""show your bookmarks"" icon is missing</li>
<li>type the URI: fivethirtyeight.com</li>
<li>click the star logo for bookmarking</li>
<li>change the destination to ""bookmarks menu""</li>
<li>save the bookmark</li>
</ol>

<p>The ""show your bookmarks"" icon continues to be missing.</p>

<p>In the general case if fivethirtyeight.com is not considered to be ""recent"" I would have to make 4 clicks in order to see the ""bookmarks menu"" when the ""show your bookmarks"" icon is missing. The 4 clicks are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>click the ""bookshelf"" icon</li>
<li>click ""bookmarks""</li>
<li>click ""show all bookmarks""</li>
<li>click ""bookmarks menu""</li>
</ol>

<p>and that is far too many steps to tolerate. </p>

<p>I have attached a sample file (with no identifiers) to illustrate the issue.  A Dropbox <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/wtpptqxqsa5lamc/MedicHoursTrial.xlsx?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link is here</a>.</p>

<p>I am trying to calculate total hours worked by each medic, per year, on Worksheet ""Stats"", using data from the other Sheets.</p>

<p>The cases seen by each medic are recorded on the Worksheet ""Summary"" in a Table named ""Record"". For each case, the year, shift, medic's name, and whether there are errors in the record are listed. </p>

<p>Each shift has a unique identifier listed on Worksheet ""TimeIndex"" in a Table named ""ShiftValueT"".</p>

<p>I am trying to write a formula which does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifies rows matching multiple criteria (Year, Medic, ISERROR=FALSE())</li>
<li>Uses those rows to identify the UniqueShift values which correspond</li>
<li>Creates an array from unique values of the UniqueShift column which
correspond (ie removes duplicates). </li>
<li>Uses those unique values (INDEX MATCH) in the ShiftValueT table to find the corresponding hours per UniqueShift type </li>
<li>Sums all the instances of hours corresponding to UniqueShifts identified</li>
</ol>

<p>I've gotten this far (as an array formula):</p>

<p><code>=SUM(INDEX(ShiftValueT[[Value]:[Value]],MATCH(INDEX(Record[[UniqueShift]:[UniqueShift]],MATCH(B$1&amp;FALSE()&amp;$A2,Record[[Year]:[Year]]&amp;Record[[ISERROR]:[ISERROR]]&amp;Record[[Medic]:[Medic]],0)),ShiftValueT[[UniqueShift]:[UniqueShift]],0)))</code></p>

<p>but this only returns the first instance of UniqueShift and the single hours reference in the ShiftValueT.</p>

<p>How can I modify my formula to return the sum of all the hours?</p>

"1455483","How to get WSL use Git-Bash to run a `latexmk` command?","<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can I call <strong>Git-Bash</strong> to issue a command from <strong>WSL</strong>? Detailed contexts go between the two dividers. (<em>Simple solution appended towards the end of this question</em>.)</p>

<hr>

<p>I use an alias to compile all my <code>*.tex</code> documents, using <strong>Git-Bash</strong> on
Windows 10. In my <code>c:/users/UserName/.bashrc</code>, I have mapped: </p>

<pre><code>alias lmk='latexmk -pvc -pdf --synctex=1 -src-specials -silent -time -interaction=nonstopmode'
</code></pre>

<p>With a native <code>Gvim.exe</code> editor and a <strong>Git-Bash</strong> instance that hosts the <code>latexmk</code> command, I no longer need to bother with the tedious compilation process.</p>

<p>However, when I issue the same <code>latexmk</code> command through WSL, I can no longer perform forward search and backward search. Some options for the compiler will write to the PDF (or its syntex file), mapping all lines on the PDF to the lines from the source file detailed in WSL-flavored paths. Another way to fix these is to: either opt completely into the WSL world, where I use the native editor + PDF viewer (which is completely new to me), or, to debug further into the compiler and see if I can swap out all the WSL-flavored paths into Windows-flavored paths (which is again, time-consuming).</p>

<p>A simple solution would be, to somehow call Git-Bash from WSL, whereby passing the <code>lmk</code> commands to the Git-Bash as command line arguments?</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside from the details, in general, is <strong>Git-Bash</strong> some executable that I can call directly from WSL? If so, how to <em>tell</em> WSL that I would like to run the following ""thing""? On my machine, I can find <strong>Git-Bash</strong> as: <code>""C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe""</code>. I tried to pass <code>/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/git-bash.exe</code> to WSL, and it has only kindly opened a stand-alone Git Bash window.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/r9AuG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/r9AuG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<hr>

<h2>One-liner solution using zsh + GitBash</h2>

<p>I use <code>zsh</code> as my default shell for WSL, and here goes the function that I defined to
make <code>lmk TexFilename.tex</code> directly callable from WSL's command line:</p>

<pre><code>function lmk(){
    ""$(wslpath ""C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe"")"" --hide -c ""lmk $1""
}
# Note, the `lmk` here is actually alias from Git-Bash, as defined in: c:/users/UserName/.
</code></pre>

<p>The following line makes terminating the hidden <code>bash</code>/<code>perl</code> process handy: issuing <code>lmk_kill</code> shall quite all running compilers (via <code>latexmk</code>, a perl-script).</p>

<pre><code>alias lmk_kill=""powershell.exe kill -n perl""
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>To summarize: with the new <code>zsh</code> function, I am compiling <code>*.tex</code> files from WSL as if I am using the native MikTeX compilers on Windows. This works well with my current settings of GVIM + Sumatra, where both forward and backward search are fully functional. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Even simpler solution: host <code>latexmk</code> through PowerShell</h2>

<p>For details, refer to <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1539624/361600"">this answer</a> below. </p>

<pre><code>alias lmk='powershell.exe -c latexmk -pvc -pdf --synctex=-1 -src-specials -silent -time -interaction=nonstopmode'
</code></pre>

<p>And, compile <code>main.tex</code> files anywhere, say, in a pane of Tmux session on WSL, using simple command <code>lmk main.tex</code>.</p>

<p>Screenshot showing conditional formatting:<br>
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UfbnE.png"" alt=""Screenshot showing conditional formatting""></p>

<p>If the date is equal to or less than 100 days from the present date, the date cell is highlighted green, using this conditional formatting formula:</p>

<pre><code>=TODAY()-C3:C12&lt;120
</code></pre>

<p>If the date is greater than 100 days from the present date, the cell is highlighted red, using this conditional formatting formula:</p>

<pre><code>=TODAY()-C3:C12&gt;=120
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, all rows are sorted by date, in ascending order, and blank date cells produce no conditional formatting:</p>

<pre><code>=ISBLANK(C3:C12)=TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am trying to solve is that, when a date is updated for a particular item, all the rows need to be dynamically rearranged into the new ascending date order using VBA code.</p>

<p>In the screenshot, you'll notice that Item 6 is out of place. Its entire row should automatically be moved into the correct sequence by date order, by the macro.</p>

<p>I have tried to incorporate the following script that I found online. Unfortunately, some very strange behavior ensued and my rows were rearranged in a way that I could not properly understand. The header gets moved by the macro below everything else, no matter what I do!</p>

<p>Can anyone see what's wrong with this VBA code? It makes an absolute mess of my data as soon as I update any dates.</p>

<p>... and:</p>

<p>""<em>Its entire row should automatically be moved into the correct sequence by date order, by the macro</em>.""</p>

<p>If you answer that my upload speed is a bottle-neck, then I would ask - so does every website in the world have an upload speed at 20MB\s (200Mbps) or more? Because that's the speed I download from every website in the world (unless they limited the speed intentionally)</p>

<p>The way I understand it is that uploads and downloads are doing the same thing - transferring data back or forth through the same cable - so TECHNICALLY, there should be no speed difference between the two. The only reason downloads are faster is because ISPs do this on purpose to limit traffic clutter in the wires. The decided that more people need to download so that's the one they made faster. (excuse the amateur way of explaining it - but you get the point). So when data is being transferred from one person to another - how does an ISP ever decide who is the UPLOADER and who is the DOWNLOADER? Do they check the upload speed of both sides and give the transfer the lowest speed from the two? I thought that when an ISP would see that I am the SERVER - it would let the connection speed go as high as my DOWNLOAD speed.</p>

<p>So if you say that EVERY site that I download from at 20MB\s MUST have an upload speed of at least 20MB\s-  even this wouldn't be accurate because let's say 100 people are downloading from the same site, at the same time... so yes, we all know of site's crashing from too many simultaneous connections, but 100 people are not a lot to crash a server, so if 100 people would be downloading at the same time at 20MB\s, that would mean (according to what you're saying) that the site they are downloading from would need an upload speed of at least 2GB\s. Is this even possible?</p>

<p>EDIT 01:
Again, why is MY ISP involved with what the person downloading from me is doing? When HE clicks on the download link - it's HIS ISP that should be saying ""oh, you want to download? No problem, you can download at your download speed."" How come when ""I"" download from somewhere, my ISP allows ME to download at my download speed and doesn't say ""sorry, you can't download at your fast download speed because that server you are trying to download from - his ISP is limiting the data transfer to their upload speed."" </p>

"1316954","Excel: Count if values match","<p>I basically have two predetermined worksheets with data in a format I can't modify the way it populates.</p>

<p>I just need to check for duplicates between the two sheets and total them so I can subtract them from another formula so the values aren't double-counted.</p>

<p>Another issue is that the values aren't exact. For instance the one cell on ""SSP"" will say ""AZNG V210354 !"" whereas the other sheet will have a cell that just says ""v210354"" so I'll probably need wildcards incorporated. Also, I don't want it to count any blanks as matches.</p>

"1456870","Services prefer to block executable files, why is that?","<p>I have been having a discussion with a friend of mine about executable files, more specifically .jar and .exe files.</p>

<p>When you download a file from your browser it usually asks for permission to store that specific file, is there a reason why that happens?</p>

<p>An example would be ""gmail"" or any other mailing service that ""blocks"" executable attachments supposedly because they can infect your system, if so, what's the technicalities behind that?</p>

<p>The following is probably a personal opinion, which is against the stackoverflow guidelines of writing proper posts, you can hover over it if you want on your own, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could confirm or deny my hypothesis on a comment reply.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>I believe that the reason behind this, blocking specific executables is because they actually run on your device when you store them. For example a (.jar) file would be executed by Java the moment you allow it to be stored on your device because Java needs to make sure it's a proper executable. To me this raises a security concern because any executable that contains malicious code would be executed at least once without you knowing (or at least understanding that you allowed it to run in the first place).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd love to know if there is an actual reason behind this, thank you.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I have grub installed which allows me to boot whichever I wish.</p>

<p>From the Middle of March I have been prompted on windows to install a new version (Windows 10 is version 1607 currently).</p>

<p><strong>Update attempt 1 to n: Using Windows Update Assistance</strong></p>

<p>I tried downloading as prompted, which downloaded ok, the machine restarted - I chose Windows from the grub menu; it started installing - reached 25% and restarted again. Chose windows again from grub menu - windows restored previous version - no update.</p>

<p>I tried the Windows update troubleshooter - it found and 'fixed issues'; tried the update assistance again - same result. Ran the trouble shoot again, same issues found and fixed; tried again as above - same result - rinse and repeat every few days.</p>

<p><strong>Update attempt 2: Using Windows Media Creation Tool</strong></p>

<p>Using the tool, I burnt and verified a DVD - and booted my machine from that DVD; the DVD software could not even detect Windows on my machine despite it being fully authorized and licensed.</p>

<p>After this failed attempt - booting into windows gives this error : </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/UTHRF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UTHRF.png"" alt=""Windows Error - post DVD update attempt""></a></p>

<p>Needless to say this error code don't seem to exist on Microsoft's web sites.
- it is odd that this error is generated when the DVD claimed it couldn't even find a Windows version - but clearly it found something in order to trigger this error.</p>

<p>Running the Update Trouble shooter - again it claims to finds the same set of errors as it did previously - suggesting that the Trouble shooter is mostly pointless.</p>

<p><strong>Where Next ?</strong></p>

<p>So the big Question - How on Earth do i get windows to install this windows update ? [previously windows updates have always worked (even when they required a reboot), but this one just fails].</p>

<p><strong>Additional Info</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>looking at the Windows Event Log - there is no log message of any of the attempted upgrades, or any error message from any of the failures and windows re-versions.</li>
<li>The machine uses UEFI - if that matters</li>

Unfortunately, after multiple attempts I don't think I'm getting anywhere.</p>

<p>Specifically, I would like all my text to read as green unless one of the following criteria is met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The text should be red if the skill is restricted by Journiate rank</li>
<li>The text should be red if the skill's pre-requisite is restricted by Journiate rank</li>
<li>The text should be purple if the skill is restricted by the Mastery rank</li>
<li>The text should be purple if the skill's pre-requisite is restricted by the Mastery rank</li>
</ul>

<p>I've developed data labels for pretty much every set of data there is on the skill lists, but I've still been unable to figure out what formula to input to have conditional formatting output even one of my desired colors.</p>

<p>Edit 1:
I wasn't sure what the best way was to present this so I've attached both a marked up jpeg for reference.</p>

<p>I've simply provided a section of one of the skill sets: spells that can be cast by the Alchemist class.</p>

<p>The majority of these spells can be cast right out the gate. Either they have no pre-requisites or those pre-requisites are not rank restricted. These I would like to conditionally format themselves to green text.</p>

<p>A handful of those spells, however, are restricted by either the Journiate or Master rank.</p>

<p>The list of Journiate restricted skills lists Beguile Arcanea, which is the pre-req for Control Arcanea. The latter is not shown on the list because it's rank restriction is implied by needing to pass through Beguile Arcanea. I would like the formatting to check against the list of Journiate skills and if it comes back positive, then show the skill in red. Furthermore, I would like the the command to check the associated pre-req column to check if there's a pre-req skill that is rank restricted to Journiate, and if so, indicate that the skill should be red.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a list of skills restricted to Master rank. This would follow the same routine as the Journiate skills, but override the Journiate color of red and replace it with purple.</p>

<p>I'm using a series of data tables to associate the information with each other. I think that this needs some sort of multi-step If-Then function with VLOOKUPs built into it, but after multiple iterations, I've been unable to figure out how to craft this function.</p>

So running the Installer like any Win16 bits app is required…</p>

<p><strong>I’m fully aware the official Microsoft answer is <code>you can’t</code></strong>.<br>
But the unofficial answer is Wine has no problem running the Installer on 64 bits Linux (but the Direct3d to OpenGl conversion bite performance of the installed 32 bits program) (such an irony where Linux runs Windows programs better than Microsoft).<br>
<strong>The reason is vm86 mode isn’t needed for Windows 16 bits, but only 16 bits segment support through the <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/modify_ldt.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">local descriptor table</a></strong>. It seems in reality Microsoft has no reason to put the effort into changing the way they do.</p>

"1461062","New NVME or Old Sata SSD for boot","<p>I'm working on a new PC build (Windows 10 Pro, possibly dual boot Linux), which I will be using the PC all day every day for work (Web Dev elopement and Graphic Design) as well as playing games. I purchased a Samsung 970 Pro 512 NVMe Drive, ostensibly to use as the system boot drive. </p>

<p>However, I'm starting to wonder if the performance benefits for windows specifically would be noticeable enough to warrant using it as the boot drive over an older drive I have, the Pro Evo 850. The idea of having more room on the 970 pro for Large Applications (Adobe CC) and Games while windows is contained entirely on it's own drive is appealing. It would certainly make reinstalls a lot easier, since I wouldn't have to download and install adobe again and other large programs again.</p>

<p>I know that technically the 970 would be better for windows, but I'm wondering how that would translate to real world benefits (outside of saving 1 second or so at boot), especially when all the other major programs and games would be loading off the newer, better drive.</p>

<p>Finally, if the speed different has more do do with the older drive being and 850 Evo rather than it being Sata, I might consider getting a cheap modern 128gb sata drive to dedicate to windows, and use the 850 Evo as a scratch disk.</p>

<p>The questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Would putting Windows on newer higher end NVMe SSD have noticeable real-world performance increase in over-all usage over having it on an older Sata SSD, assuming the rest of the programs will be on the newer higher performance NVMe SSD in either case?</li>
<li>Is giving Windows 10 it's own dedicated SSD a worthwhile practice?</li>
<li>Given a choice between a faster and smaller (120gb) SSD and an larger (250gb) and slower SSD, which is better for the OS and which is better as a scratch disk for Adobe CC?</li>

- Newly built Windows 10 PCs cannot join the domain. I get the message ""An active Directory Domain Controller for the domain <em>domain_name</em> could not be contacted...""
Here is the DCDIAG.TXT file it is pointing to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The domain name ""domain_name"" might be a NetBIOS domain name.  If
  this is the case, verify that the domain name is properly registered
  with WINS.</p>
  
  <p>If you are certain that the name is not a NetBIOS domain name, then
  the following information can help you troubleshoot your DNS
  configuration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following error occurred when DNS was queried for the service location (SRV) resource record used to locate an Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC) for domain ""domain_name"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The error was: ""DNS name does not exist."" (error code 0x0000232B
  RCODE_NAME_ERROR)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The query was for the SRV record for _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.domain_name</p>

<p>Common causes of this error include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The DNS SRV records required to locate a AD DC for the domain are not registered in DNS. These records are registered with a DNS server automatically when a AD DC is added to a domain. They are updated by the AD DC at set intervals. This computer is configured to use DNS servers with the following IP addresses:</p>

<li><p>One or more of the following zones do not include delegation to its child zone:</p>

<pre><code>security

<p>Besides I have the same sort of message when launching rdp machines that are not in the same subnet or lan.</p>

<p>I heard that somewhere on the DC, the former administrator set mac addresses recognition rule.

The TV stations are accessed as a playlist or as a VLC addon - at least for some providers: like <a href=""https://addons.videolan.org/p/1153978/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. This VLC addon was not updated for VLC 3.x and  (now I notice) is even absent at that address - while it can still be installed from within VLC, even from VLC 3.x, only it shows no stations in that version.</p>

<p>I was wondering whether those TV stations can be played by other video players beside VLC.</p>
<p>That playlist cannot be played by mpv, smplayer or other video players that I have tried until recently, and I was convinced that only VLC can: but, testing in Kubuntu 18.04 I have seen that <strong>Kaffeine can play it too</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>What does it take for a video player to be able to play those TV stations? Is it a codec? Can they be played by other video players? Is it limited to VLC and Kaffeine? (I think Kaffeine is based on Xine, but Xine-ui cannot play those TV stations either.)</p>

<p>So far, I use an Excel conditional formatting rule to achieve this, and it works; however, dragging and dropping the contents of cells from one column to another causes the conditional formatting rules to become very fragmented and is quickly becoming a mess. What started out as two conditional formatting rules, one for column A and another for column B, rapidly becomes dozens of separate rules as Excel alters the &quot;applies to&quot; field of the rules with every copy or move of cell data.</p>

<p>A VBA script that is able to achieve the same thing as my conditional formatting rules would be much better as it would not be affected by moving or copying and pasting cell data. I would be able to freely drag and drop my data into the appropriate column without the underlying VBA code being affected.</p>

Anyone?","<p>So I can only get in on the standard Wayland Server through the rescue boot, but I think it is running off of my graphics card and the driver that was installed. I cannot get Autodesk Maya installed. Maybe there is someone at Red Hat who can tell me how to install the latest subscription download that there is. Autodesk does not update their instructions and the download contains a completely different file structure than the example listed on their site for installing using the RPM utility. All I can do is run rmp -ivh on the listed rpm's in the download package. However, all I get afterwards is a maya icon in my software list that does nothing and when taken to its properties it claims that maya_2016.desktop cannot be found and this is for a 2019 install. The actual installation process for the Maya rpm took 2 minutes to install, a little too short I think. Any help I would really appreciate it.</p>

But, I am not sure how to do this. I have a just sign in subscription.

Microsoft then offered a free upgrade to Windows 10 for free and that offer lasted for a certain time period. The upgrade itself was permanent. I did the upgrade and as the installation was free I didn't have a product key to provide as such. Now my windows decided to do a Windows Update and the next time I started it up I got the error: ""No bootable devices found"". I went to bios settings, did a health test, came up 100% healthy. Opened the machine and re-connected the cables and everything. Tried to start it up. Didn't work. Went back into bios to change to legacy boot, dragged the os drive to the top of the list. Didn't work. I then created a bootable usb. That too didnt work. I then decided to take the machine to a professional. They called me a few days after dropoff and said I might have to buy a windows 10 to get it installed on there. I debated with them for a bit and they said they could try to install the windows 7 that the machine came with and hopefully that can get activated automatically. I then asked why it is impossible to install an un-activated version of Win 10 and then calling up microsoft to verify that I did indeed have an activated Win 10 version on the machine and therefore get my/an activation key? The guy argued his way out of that one pretty much saying that was not possible.</p>

<p>My question therefore is, is it not possible to get Win 10 installed in the machine without purchase, and then I can do the activation myself, whether by calling up microsoft to re-activate it for me, or by buying a new product key?</p>

<pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\bittwiste.exe -I packets.pcap -O packetsModified.pcap -T ip -s 192.168.1.104,m1_ip -d 192.168.1.31,m2_ip
</code></pre>

<p>Then use <code>bittwist.exe</code> to find out the network interface in m1:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\pete\Documents\tmp&gt;C:\Windows\System32\bittwist.exe -d
</code></pre>

<p>1. \Device\NPF_{4F9C1634-3817-41FF-96A5-5818BEDA9418} (Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection)</p>

<p>Then use <code>bittwist.exe</code> to send the modified packets to that interface in m1:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\pete\Documents\tmp&gt;C:\Windows\System32\bittwist.exe -i 1 -m 0.001 packetsModified.pcap
</code></pre>

<p>In both m1 and m2, I run wireshark to capture traffic (with and without filters to narrow down the relevant packets), but I can only see packets with <code>src m1_ip</code>/<code>dst m2_ip</code> appear in wireshark of m1, but not m2, I don’t understand why the packets seem don’t arrive from m1 to m2. </p>

<p>If I ping <code>m2_ip</code> from m1, I can see reply and ICMP packets appear in both wireshark in m1 and m2. Both firewalls in m1 and m2 are off. 
Anyone has idea?</p>

<li><code>=IF(REGEXMATCH(B2,""accepted""),REGEXEXTRACT(B2,""[A-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-z0-9.-]+\.[A-z]{2,4}""),"""")</code> => this extracts the email address if the cell contains the word 'accepted'</li>
<li><code>=TEXTJOIN("","",TRUE,B3:Z3)</code> => this concatenates all the email addresses in a single cell</li>

<p>I would like to do all of that in a single cell but I am not sure how. The obvious solution would be to apply the second step to a range instead of a specific cell, but I couldn't figure out how. Thanks a lot for your help! </p>

<p>The PC running Win 10 Pro can access the XP PC and the XP computer can access both W10 machines.</p>

<p>There is no domain or WINS, the router is primary DNS, so local machine names can be resolved by DNS, needed for accessing some web pages. All devices use DHCP from the router. I did have some DNS problems, solved by installing Apple's Bonjour service on the Windows PCs.</p>

<p>In Windows Explorer > Network only the laptop itself, the router and the NAS boxes are shown. I can type a computer name into the address bar and it will appear in the tree on the left and its shares on the right.</p>

You can't connect to the file share because it's not secure. This share requires the obsolete SMB1 protocol, which is unsafe and could expose your system to attack.

"1468606","Reverse engineering unknown hex/binary representation to decimal","<p>I am decoding a device that pumps out location data via network packets.
Lets say we have want to decode altitude. The altitude packet is 4 bytes. So the info in hex is.</p>

<pre><code>0x05 0x79 = 5.945313(meters)
</code></pre>

<p>With testing I determined that the first 2 bytes is everything before the comma. 
Mystery is how hex value ""79"" gets turned into 945313.</p>

<p>I then crafted my own packets, where I only changed the mentioned 2 bytes and made a table:</p>

<pre><code>0x01 = 0.007813
0x02 = 0.015625
0x03 = 0.023438
0x04 = 0.03125
0x05 = 0.039063
0x06 = 0.046875
0x07 = 0.054688
0x08 = 0.0625
0x09 = 0.070313
0x0a = 0.078125
0x0b = 0.085938
0x0c = 0.09375
0x0d = 0.101563
0x0e = 0.109375
0x0f = 0.117188
0x10 = 0.125
0x20 = 0.25
0x30 = 0.376
0x40 = 0.5
0x50 = 0.625
0x60 = 0.75
0x70 = 0.875
0x80 = NaN
</code></pre>

<p>for example making <code>0x79 gives = 70 + 09 = 0.875 + 0.070313 = 0.945313</code> which is correct.</p>

<p>But how to calculate the value without doing this table. There has to be somekind of regularity involved but I cannot see this.

"1328493","Vim. How to remap default navigation ('w', 'b', 'e'...) keys","<p>Is there a way to change 'w' key behavior to make it actually behave like 'b' key? Failed to find navigation commands if there is any.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>In Vim key 'w' in normal mode is used to navigate to first letter of the next word. 'e' key is used to navigate to last letter of the next word. It would be great to use 'w' key to navigate to PREVIOUS word (like 'b' key behave) instead of the next one. When jumping from one word to another with 'e' you miss desired word (which happens very frequently) and you need to jump one word back, it is absolutely annoying to take off you hand and search for 'b' key instead of 'w' key which is currently right under your finger, and is unused by me at all.</p>

<p>It sometimes frustrating to have such customizable tool like Vim and not being able to simply remap default navigation keys. It is possible in almost all relatively modern IDEs or even text editors.</p>

"1328947","Home Network with 2 routers","<p>I am newbie regarding networking . . .</p>

<p>I have a Netgear router that points to my ISP and provides DHCP address to inside devices (pretty basic). I have connected a second D-Link router with ""outward facing"" interface static IP to match that of the internal IP range of the Netgear router. This second router provides a different set of IPs to any machines attached to it - basically trying to setup an isolated test lab. Machines connected to the 2nd router can see the ""Internet"" and browse/ping with no issue.</p>

<p>Machines connected to the first router cannot connect to either the second router or any machines on the second IP range . . .</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

"1469807","Generate Unique List from Table","<p>I have a list of names in the leftmost column of a table, and between 1 and 4 languages entered into their own columns (lang1, lang2, lang3, lang4). I would like to create an area where names can be entered into any one of six cells and an adjacent list is generated with all of the languages known by this set of individuals. </p>

<p>Essentially I want Excel to compare six 1 row by 4 column arrays and return a single column array of whatever appropriate length. A union of the values in six arrays.</p>

<p>Here is an example I created without the formula in order to help explain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/qfIpW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/qfIpW.png"" alt=""Example 1""></a></p>

<p>I need to generate a list of all of the languages a group of less than or equal to six people is able to speak. If Jacob were the only one in the list, then the list would simply read ""English, Spanish, Portuguese"". If the list consisted of only Jacob and Sally, it would read ""English, Spanish, Portuguese, French"".</p>

<p>I can change the setup of the table if necessary. For instance, originally each language was its own column, with an X or a Y as a flag to indicate that the person knew the language. I thought this current way might be easier. </p>

<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/mIZOr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IDM SS</a></p>
<p>IDM is already using 8 connections per file, so I'm not sure what can be done to improve speed. Other than that, say YouTube streaming is ~60-100 KB/s while I can download videos at ~500 KB/s. So streaming is not a good experience as well.<br />
The problem is not with the server since 500 KB/s is max I get anywhere.
The network might be throttling individual connections. But shouldn't having multiple connections improve the speed if downloading multiple files from same server multiplies the speed.<br />
Anything that can be improve the situation</p>
<p>Edit: Increased the number of connections, and it did increase the speed. So I guess, I'll just have use very high number of connections till I can utilize the speed fully. Which would also explain why streaming sucks.</p>

<p>When i first got it it ran very well and was fairly quick running Windows 7 Home 64-bit on 2GB of DDR3 RAM. Well it crashed roughly 2 years after and ended up having to replace the 250GB SATA HDD with a warranty replacement which was a WD Blue Caviar 250GB 5200RPM. Same as was in it before.</p>

<p>After installing Windows Ultimate from my desktop computer (because the laptop didnt come with any restore software), it was extremely slow so it got put up for a couple years until my son asked me for it.</p>

<p>I was thinking it was a RAM issue so I replaced the 2GB with 8GB (2x4GB) of compatible memory. Windows Ultimate recognized the upgrade so I know the RAM works, but Windows was still slow.</p>

<p>I went to the Acer store and bought their system recovery disks for that specific laptop to try to do a complete factory reset. All was going fine until disk 3. When the restore got to 80%, I got a ""Cyclic redundancy error"".</p>

<p>I called Acer and they told me to try to run disks again and still didn't work, giving me the same error at the same point of the restore. At this point they said there was nothing else they could help me, since the laptop was out of warranty.</p>

<p>So I ran DBAN to try to save the drive and wipe it clean thinking maybe something was corrupted or malicious on the disk keeping me from installing the Acer recovery disk for Windows 7. I ran autonuke and it took about 5.5 hours to complete with no errors and said there was 223GB available space.</p>

<p>So I ran the recovery disks again and got the same cyclic redundancy error at the 80% mark. I probably have a bad hard drive but want to know for sure before I buy new. Is there any way to run a bootable disk like DBAN to check the HDD? If so, are there any known that are free that work well?</p>

"1332611","Unable to get functional menus in exact ISO rip of DVD without mounting it","<p>I'm running Windows 7.</p>

<p>I have a collection of DVDs that I'm trying rip to my PC so I can finally bin the physical discs and free up some space. Most of the attraction of these DVDs for me is the interactive home movie experience: navigating through the menus to access the  special features. Therefore, I have two aims for ripping these DVDs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To create ISOs that I don't need to expressly mount (i.e. that can be immediately played in a media player like MPC-HC OR VLC)</p></li>
<li><p>For these ISOs to be an exact copy of the DVD sources so that, when played, all special features and the menus to access them behave exactly as they would if the ISO was mounted</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I've been able to tell, the gold standard application for what I'm trying to do here is DVDFab HD Decrypter (the free version of DVDFab). </p>

<p>Running DVDFab HD Decrypter in <code>Full Disc</code> mode outputs an ISO that plays in  both VLC and MPC-HC without mounting it, which satisfies my first goal. The problem I'm having is in satisfying the second.</p>

<h2>Making menus in an ISO work as if mounted (i.e. normally)</h2>

<h3>The goal: when the ISO is mounted</h3>

<p>So far, only expressly mounting and then playing the ISO has been analogous to the experience of playing from the physical disc. When the ISO is mounted, AutoPlay prompts me to play the DVD with Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Player displays all menus and menu items.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/IYZH3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/IYZH3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h3>Unmounted, in VLC</h3>

<p>By contrast, when using VLC to play the disc without mounting it, I can only see one menu button at a time, and rolling the mouse over where the buttons should be makes others visible.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/zBQDy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/zBQDy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h3>Unmounted, in MPC-HC and Windows Media Player</h3>

<p>MPC-HC fares even worse, as it doesn't show any menu items at all, nor does it even recognise the movie as having other titles - instead, it plays the test ISO as a linear DVD from beginning to end, including the menu screen and all titles. When playing the ISO via Windows Media Player on its own (i.e. <em>without</em> mounting it and allowing AutoPlay to open WMP), it behaves in the same way.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MpF4g.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MpF4g.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>How can I create an ISO rip of a DVD that keeps all menus functioning <em>without</em> needing the ISO to be mounted?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>What exactly about the unmounted ISO is different to the mounted one that is causing MPC-HC, VLC and Windows Media Player to fail to render its DVD menus correctly?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>EDIT:</h3>

<p>I created and tested with another ISO rip of another DVD. On this one, VLC successfully renders all menus, and MPC-HC and Windows Media Player once again are only able to play a completely menu-less, linear DVD. So far, VLC is looking like the only thing that is close to capable of what I'm trying to do here, though as the first test ISO indicates, it still has problems that need to be solved.</p>

Perhaps I should've deleted the partition with windows installation media.  It's possible the windows 10 installation media asked me to click windows 10, or windows 10 pro, and I might've clicked 'windows 10', prior to creating the second partition, though I deleted that partition anyway albeit with gparted.</p>

<p>At the moment I get two versions of windows come up in the boot menu, and there should only be one. And not only that..  I could potentially delete one of them from the boot menu, as there are things online about how to do that..</p>

<p>So basically, the idea is to use input data like the left side and create condensed data on the right WITHOUT VBA. If it can be done that is?</p>

<p>EDIT: Basically, what I need to do is combine like items (by using the ID since that is a unique identifier) and then on the same row add additional things like the count of how many tickets are opened in that and such. Its hard to put into words but basically transform the left table into the right using formulas.</p>

"1335825","How do I use an image URL with no clear file path?","<p>Why do so many image URL's have no clear file path these days?</p>

<p>When I use sites like Facebook on my PC, I often want to post an image from the Internet. Instead of downloading the image, it's much more convenient to be able to just right click the image and select ""Copy image address."" Then when I use a file picker dialogue like the one in Facebook, I can just paste in the URL and it will reupload the file automatically the same as if it was a path on my local drive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's increasingly often that I find the URL is some long encoded thing that isn't recognized as an image, perhaps because there's no file extension and maybe not even a file name. Here's an example I was easily able to find randomly in a quick Google search: <a href=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zonAUYRq0164wHlEMjd8tZEhriCOBg1104qnQ26OSRXegbdY8vFlg2Oe_xEevmGvkGU59RaaGw=w640-h400-e365"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zonAUYRq0164wHlEMjd8tZEhriCOBg1104qnQ26OSRXegbdY8vFlg2Oe_xEevmGvkGU59RaaGw=w640-h400-e365</a></p>

<p>The URL's I can use more conveniently look like this: <a href=""https://www.microsystools.com/help/a1/download-website-convert-links.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.microsystools.com/help/a1/download-website-convert-links.png</a></p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to mitigate this problem? Is there some way the ""bad"" URL's can still be used as normal images in a file picker dialogue?</p>

<p>EDIT: My apologies for being unclear. I hadn't gone through as much testing and rigor as I should have. It turns out the problem is not with file picker dialogues in general. For some reason, the problem is specific to Facebook's photo-comment functionality. When I put a photo in my own post the bad URL works just fine. But when I try to make a photo comment it looks like this:<br>
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZjWTH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZjWTH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
Instead of this:<br>
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/JT84U.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JT84U.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>And then the upload fails of course. When I try to post I just get an error.</p>

<p>This is clearly a Facebook problem, which I hadn't realized. At first I thought this problem was wider-reaching. So maybe I'm asking this in the wrong place, but I'm still curious to know if anyone has any workarounds. I frequently grab photos from Google searches to use as photo comments, but the URL problem is really screwing me up. I don't want to have to download a picture and then navigate to the download location in order to post it every time.</p>

<p>Windows Device Manager shows Auto Negotiation is enabled.  Windows Network Status shows 1.0 Gbps Full Duplex.  This is where it gets funky though.  I just reinstalled Windows and installed the core LAN driver that came packaged with the Maximus VI Hero on the official ASUS support page.  Before I had the whole 1.0 Gbps; now, ~~(EDIT: not Xfinity home, but Speedtest by Ookla [see below addendums])~~ shows ~105 Mbps.</p>

<p>I switched the cable to the other port on the modem/router ""combo"" device (i.e. CGM4140COM by Technicolor) that I was given.  Still ~105 Mbps.  There was additional info here about my Vizio TV but it's irrelevant as, apparently, my TV can only run @ 100 Mbps Full Duplex.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have the blinking orange LED indicator on my NIC as well as a solid green LED indicator.  For an Asus Maximus VI Hero, this device is built-in and is undoubtedly the Intel l217-V NIC which does not appear to have the best online documentation as to what these lights mean.  Apparently however, the blinking light would indicate just that the connection is established and is transmitting data whereas the solid LED is the speed.  The speed LED <em>does not blink, and is green.</em>  This would indicate my speed is being transmitted at <em>1.0 Gbps</em>, right?</p>

<p>Addendums:</p>

<p>I am on a 1 Gbps plan with Comcast.  It is a FTTC/N connection, so I use a coaxial splitter for cable and internet.  I bought fresh coaxial for the internet and tested the speeds using a device I ordered from Home Depot.  They reach maximum speeds on the copper.</p>

<p>I tested my speed using Ookla speedtest.  Comcast, Boston MA server.  It starts at around 90 Mbps and then slowly works its way to 100/101 Mbps, then ends at slightly below 107 Mbps.  I do not know why.</p>

<p>Upon further investigation, I realized that both ports of my modem/router are full 1.0 Gbps all around.  I saw a port running in Xfinity Home as 100 Mbps but, apparently, <em>this is my Vizio TV capped at 100 Mbps Full Duplex</em> due to its architecture.  So, my PC is definitely not, at least officially, capped at 100 Mbps in any shape or form.  As far as I can tell, anyway.</p>

<p>Yikes!  I received a number of downvotes and suggestions to edit my post for clarity.  I have made as much of these edits as I could.  I am new here, so please do comment below if you have any other suggestions or if I am missing some pertinent information.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Addendum:</em></strong></p>

<p>One last update before I finish debugging for tonight.  I added a couple more optimizations that were not included in the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/biztalk/technical-guides/windows-powershell-scripts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aforementioned script in the comment section</a> which I had added because I knew from previous experiences <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/googlefiber/comments/5oucj2/how_to_get_actual_gigabit_speeds_when_wired_in/?st=k06u9gla&amp;sh=d24248de"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">with this thread</a> that involved TcpAckFrequency.  <em>I did not perform the change at the <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/328890/new-registry-entry-for-controlling-the-tcp-acknowledgment-ack-behavior"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interface level</a> though - just the Tcpip/Parameter level.</em>  I even tried lowering the MTU to 1280 as apparently, CloudFlare did at one point <a href=""https://blog.cloudflare.com/increasing-ipv6-mtu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as shown in their blog</a>.</p>

<p>The debugging grind really gets me at night. I happened to have an extra NIC lying around that I could put into my PC. Intel Gigabit CT Desktop Adapter. There are literally no updates for this driver since Windows 7 - it is an 11-year-old card. But, it's Gigabit. Well... as I plugged it in, I still got the same result. I have one last trick up my sleeve, and then I'm done.</p>

"1480117","Kali Linux - Newly Added Users, Config Changes Not Retaining After Reboot","<p>I have installed kali using oracle virtualbox. I set the root password with the passwd command, then added a user  the following:</p>
<h1>adduser --home /newusername newusername</h1>
<p>It adds the user to the new group, creates home directory, has me set and confirm a new password, etc. When I cd .. back to the / directory, I can clearly see the new user's directory.</p>
<p>I then log out, and I'm able to login as the new user.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, after rebooting the machine, none of these changes persist. The new user is no longer there, doesn't have a folder in / directory, etc.</p>
<p>I also have an issue with autoamtic logins - I have been attempting to disable this feature so that no matter what, I must login in order to access the gui. I changed various values to &quot;false&quot; in the below config</p>
<p>/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf</p>
<p>However, as with the new user, these changes do not persist post-reboot, and I am not sure it even worked while within the same state.</p>
<p>My theory is it has something to do with the kali .iso file that is mounted on the VM. I've tried both checking and unchecking the &quot;live CD/DVD&quot; option, but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>If I try to unmount the .iso and boot just from the .vdi, it says it can't read the boot media. The only way I can run Kali seems to be with the installation .iso mounted, which I don't fully understand. In windows for instance you can install the OS with a CD - it is installed on the drive, thus you no longer need the CD to boot to the new OS after the initial install.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long winded question. Really would appreciate some help on this</p>

"1483143","How to enable boot capability in BIOS for usb drive with exclamation point?","<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>I installed Linux Mint 19.1 Cinnamon on another computer <em>(an hp 15-f039wm)</em> with a bootable USB drive. Now I'm trying to install another distro <a href=""https://www.pureos.net/download/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(PureOS Hephaestus 8.0)</a> on that same computer.</p>

<p>The USB I made for this distro and my Mint drive are both formatted as FAT32. I used Etcher to make both of them on a Windows 10 machine. Etcher is set to validate write on success, and eject on success.</p>

<p>The sha256 checksum is correct.</p>

<p>And since I'm testing this installation on an older computer, I enabled legacy mode, disabled the security, and moved the boot priority of all usb drives to the top in the BIOS so it could install a new OS from it.</p>

<h2>PROBLEMS / WHAT I TRIED</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I installed this distro on a virtual machine. It works fine as long as I set a large enough hard drive size for it <em>(otherwise it would crap out and do nothing forever)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>But on an actual computer, originally, I couldn't get the <code>!</code>'s off the boot order for usb drives in the BIOS. They all had an exclamation point next to the USB and CD drives. So I set the USB options to load first. I then did some research to get rid of the exclamations, and the only thing I could find is to select the drive with one next to it, and do shift+1, which various people said enables it. But it didn't. All I got was an 80's sounding beep from the on board speaker. The help info on the side of the screen didn't help either. It just said that items with the <code>!</code> means it's not capable booting from that drive, and nothing on how to fix it. Nor did f1 say anything (the help button). The next point fixed this problem...</p></li>
<li><p>I also had removed the CMOS battery for a couple hours. Then put it back together and turned it on. Doing that, disabling secure boot, and enabling legacy mode made it recognize the changes. So on next boot I entered the code it gave me to confirm them. But it still doesn't boot the USB drive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>But here's the new  problem:</strong> The <code>!</code>'s are gone now... When trying to see if the boot drives are loading, the Mint USB drive boots fine <em>(as if to reinstall Mint)</em>, but the PureOS USB drive won't. Thinking the drive with PureOS was faulty, I put the PureOS iso on the Mint drive with etcher, used the same USB port, and that didn't work either. And when I put mint back on that same USB drive in the same port, it boots as it should <em>(as if to reinstall mint)</em>. <strong>I also noticed that after making the Mint drive again on Windows, it ejected on success as it should, but PureOS didn't eject at all.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone know how to fix this??</p>

<p>I can go to Computer Management/Local Users and Groups and edit the properties of the new group but the only available option is to edit the member list.</p>

<p>Obviously I can add each user to the Remote Desktop group but this seems to be defeating the basic purpose of groups. The group defines a particular role and that role requires (amongst other things) remote desktop access.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember a version of Windows (NT 4.0, perhaps) where this was a straightforward operation, and the existence of predefined groups with different properties suggests that it is still possible, but so far I have not been able to find the tool to do it.</p>

<p>After investigation I have found what should be the answer to my question:</p>

<p>Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Local Security Policy/Local Policies/User Rights Assignment</p>

<p>This gives a list of rights and allows me to assign them to the group that I have created. I have tested this by giving the group the ""Change the system time"" right. This works exactly as I expected, a user that is a member of the group can now change the time where formerly it could not.</p>

<p>However, giving the group the ""Allow logon through remote desktop services"" does not work. The login attempt fails with insufficient privileges. If the user is a member of the remote desktop group then it succeeds. I cannot see any significant difference between the built in remote desktop group, which works, and the group I have created, which does not.</p>

<p>In case this is significant the remote client is xfreerdp 2.0.0-rc4, Windows runs under qemu, all on one machine. Running mstsc from a second Windows VM also fails with ""user account is not authorized for remote login"". Assigning the right directly to the user also fails</p>

<a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/305887/disable-hyperthreading-in-the-windows-7-registry"">Disable Hyperthreading in the Windows 7 registry</a><br>
I'd searching many many threads about this problem, no answer, so I ask for further information. I don't understand why someone still vote down my question after I edited.</p>

<p>Sorry for my bad English.</p>

<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br>
My problem laptop:<br>
- Asus Vivobook X512DA A512DA (a laptop).<br>
- AMD Ryzen R5 3500U with Vega 8.<br>
- 8GB of physical ram (but 6GB usable because of the iGPU).<br>
- SSD 500GB.<br>
My another laptop and perform as expected:<br>
- HP Elite Book (another laptop).<br>
- Intel i7 8550U with Intel UHD 620.<br>
- 16GB of physical ram.<br>
- SSD 500GB.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>
- The Ryzen 3500U with Vega 8 just gets 40-45fps in game <em>League of Legend</em> (lowest setting 1080p) but 60-80 fps in game <em>Dota 2</em> (medium setting 1080p).<br>
- The CPU keep running at <strong>1400MHz</strong>, instead of running at <strong>2100 - 3700MHz</strong> like it when it was working (processing data, rendering, etc).<br>
- In gaming, the <strong>temperature</strong> is <strong>always below 60</strong> C degree.<br>
- In other hand, the Intel i7 8550U gets 60-70fps in game <em>League of Legend</em> (highest setting, low shadow) but 50-60fps in game <em>Dota 2</em> (lowest setting 1080p, even lower than the ryzen).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/qkY6U.jpg"" alt=""highest setting"">
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PEPji.jpg"" alt=""lowest setting""></p>

<p><strong>What I believe in:</strong><br>
- This League of Legend game only use 2 threads (what it want is more Hz per core). So if I want to <strong>get more fps in game <em>League of Legend</em></strong>, I've to disable SMT (hyper threading) to force the cpu focus on the main thread per core.  </p>

<p><strong>What I've done:</strong><br>
- I know that disable HT (or SMT) is bios feature only, but the cheap laptop Vivobook X512DA A512DA does not allow that (it does not have that option in bios setting).<br>
- I've downloaded some software like cpu packer, unpacker... but I've not seen anythink like pack a core (or a thread), it lacks many features compared to the preview images in the web, it only has reduce all to 5% 10% or something I dont really understand. msconfig seem not helping much when setting cores to 2 will make cpu only use 2 threads in 1 core.</p>

<p><strong>What I hope:</strong><br>
- May there are some tricks to get 60fps for the game, or something like disable the second thread per core.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you all.</strong></p>

"1487619","Create network route to specific IP address for VirtualBox guest","<p>What I'm trying to do is to reach a specific IP address from a VirtualBox guest with host-only networking in another subnet. I want to keep the guest machine isolated (not reachable from outside except for that specific IP and more important no internet access). I'm not sure if that is possible at all since it is called ""host-only"" network and maybe there is another, better solution for this - I'm happy about any type of advice. </p>

<p>This is my current setup:</p>

<p><strong>Host machine A (Ubuntu 14.04):</strong> </p>

<p>eth0: 192.168.0.100, gateway 192.168.0.1</p>

<p>vboxnet0: 192.168.56.1</p>

<p><strong>Guest machine B (Windows 10) with host-only adapter:</strong></p>

<p>192.168.56.101, gateway 192.167.56.1</p>

<p><strong>Another machine C:</strong></p>

<p>192.168.0.101</p>

<p>What I need is that machine <strong>B</strong> can reach machine <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> but no other machines/network or internet. I can currently ping the host machine <strong>A</strong> from the guest machine <strong>B</strong> via <code>ping 192.168.0.100</code> but not machine <strong>C</strong>. I tried creating a route on the host machine <strong>A</strong> using the command </p>

<p><code>ip route add 192.168.56.101 via 192.168.0.100 dev eth0</code></p>

<p>but ping from <strong>B</strong> to <strong>A</strong> won't work after doing this. </p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</strong> It is now clear to me that creating a route on the host dosn't make sense and is the wrong approach for this question.</em></p>

<p>I have to admit that I am not a network expert and therefore I am happy about any kind of feedback.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance. </p>

<p>The whoever said the issue is related to range was correct. Because the A2, in this case, is in the A column, it's picking up on itself. I have also tried If-Then statements, however those have all ended in disaster. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Using the suggested formula of: =SUMIF($D$2:D2,A2,A$2:A2) and dragging it down resulted in all zeros as the result. I have a small range and an exaple of where you can see cards that should have a balance, but the formula reads 0. I know this is an oddly specific request and i appreciate any and all help. </p>

<p>I had my Bluetooth adapter turned off by an accident from my mini PC (Skull Canyon) and I only have a Bluetooth keyboard, no wired keyboard, nor a wireless USB receiver keyboard. I have a USB wireless mouse, fortunately.</p>
<p>So I could <em>not</em> type anything on my terminal (I am using Ubuntu) to enable the Bluetooth adapter back on with the command below:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
</code></pre>
<p>So, I had to type the command above in my email account and sent it to myself from my Surface Go so I could open it from my mini PC, copied it with USB wireless mouse and pasted in the terminal.</p>
<p>But what if you don't have a second machine to back you up if this situation happens to you. What can it be done? The Bluetooth keyboard just becomes completely useless in a crisis like this. So what is the point of having it in the end?</p>
<p>Another situation that the Bluetooth keyboard becomes completely useless is when the time you need to install a fresh OS system, Ubuntu for instance. You will need to type to install at certain stages, but the Bluetooth adapter and driver are not ready until you have installed the OS. You would need an old fashion wired keyboard or USB receiver keyboard to do that.</p>
<p>The only solution I can think off is to have a USB receiver wireless keyboard ready all the time for cases like this. But this is not ideal because you end up owning duplicates of things.</p>
<p>So, can we <strong>convert</strong> the Bluetooth keyboard to any Bluetooth devices to a <strong>wireless USB receiver device</strong> with some kind of converter or adapter?</p>
<p>I have been reading about Bluetooth adapters, Bluetooth receivers, Bluetooth transmitters, but I don't think they are the answer (maybe I am wrong).</p>

"1493196","Properly expand copied file names using XCOPY","<p>I've made a batch script that is set to copy all <code>.cpp</code> files from a location I have set. It can copy the files <em>and</em> retain the folder structure, but it isn't expanding the copied file names properly. I also have an older version that is able to do this, but it also copies <em>everything</em> from the target folder to the new folder. The goal of the new version is to <strong>only</strong> copy a specific file type.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax using <code>XCOPY</code> that properly expands file names, but copies all of the folder's contents:</p>

<pre><code>ECHO D | XCOPY ""%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects"" ""Backup\Projects"" /S /Q /N
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the new syntax that fails to expand the filenames of copied file types:</p>

<pre><code>ECHO F | XCOPY ""%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\*.cpp"" ""Backup\Projects\"" /S /Q /N
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of the abbreviated/unexpanded file names I get in the target directory:</p>

<p><code>WRNM~1.CPP</code>.</p>

<p>I don't know if the prompt override command switches <em>(<code>/S /Q /N</code>)</em> are affecting this, but I need the prompts to be overridden by them due to the sheer number of files being copied.
I would also like to note that despite copying files with the newer syntax, I can still get <code>XCOPY</code> to copy them even if I define the target as a directory using the <code>D</code> switch.</p>

"1493795","Using the public hostname in a personal public DNS server","<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>I have a small website on a Windows 10 Pro N pc with (e.g.) public ip: <code>123.456.78</code>
If I type in that ip from anywhere the website opens fine.</p>

<p>Now I also bought 2 domains name e.g. <code>www.somewebsiteOne.com</code> and <code>www.somewebsiteTwo.org</code> at 2 different domain sellers. And depend on a dns service which forwards <code>www.somewebsiteTwo.ddns.net</code> to <code>123.456.78</code>. In the domain sellers, I can then forward <code>www.somewebsiteTwo.org</code> to <code>www.somewebsiteTwo.ddns.net</code>. My intention is to replace the dependency on the DNS server with my self-hosted opensource DNS server using Technitium.</p>

<p>To verify my own DNS server is working I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open powershell on a different computer on a different network.</li>
<li>enter: nslookup www.somewebsiteTwo.org 123.456.78</li>
<li>Which indeed returns the ip adress 123.456.78</li>
</ol>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Now if I try to enter the ip adress of that DNS server in either of the 2 domain sellers, I am required to enter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hostname</li>
<li>Ip adress</li>
</ul>

<p>Where for the hostname I can enter something like <code>www.somewebsiteTwo.ddns.net</code>(which is a dns server that forwards <code>www.somewebsiteTwo.org</code> to <code>123.456.78</code>  and for the ip adress <code>123.456.78</code>.  After calling with one of the two, I was explained they use the hostname and not the IP adress to find my personal public DNS server, not the IP adress.</p>

<p>This essentially means that I need a dns server to forward some hostname for my personal public dns server to the ip adress of my dns server. Which defeats my intentions. Therefore I have the following:</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How can I determine and use a functioning hostname that refers to my personal public dns server at <code>123.456.78</code>?</p>

<h2>Attempts</h2>

<ul>
<li>I tried to enter the hostname of my pc, e.g. what's returned in cmd at command <code>hostname</code>. But that is not considered a valid hostname.</li>
<li>I tried to enter <code>123.456.78</code> but that is not considered a valid hostname.</li>
<li>I tried to enter <code>http://123.456.78/</code> but it does not work.</li>
<li>The ip-adresses don't work as a hostname referring to a DNS server because:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hostname to use for a DNS server and when registering and using a DNS (sub-) domain must be a valid fully qualified DNS hostname such
  as for instance ns1.example.com. or
  customer-5363.dsl-users.isp.example.net . The protocol does not allow
  an IP-address. If you want to use a DNS record such as ns1.example.com
  to register the domain example.com your registrar will need to set up
  the correct glue record first</p>

<p>They take five years to start up, usually with a bunch of switching between a black and dark grey screen. And then once it finally does start up, it either goes into a login loop when I try to login, or my screen decides to have a stroke and go all crazy, then freeze and die.</p>

<p>From what I've heard, this is a problem with my GPU. My system doesn't even have a dedicated GPU, but it does have a small, integrated one. Specs:</p>

<pre><code>CPU: AMD Athlon II X3 445
RAM: 8GB
GPU: NVIDIA MCP61 (integrated)
HDD: 2TB
Motherboard: BIOSTAR N68S3B

When I connect my TV and clone both displays, the laptop screen adapts to the higher resolution and displays 1920x1080. However, I have been unable to find a way to do this without the TV being connected. The native resolution is 1366x768, and 1080p is not an available setting. I have tried custom resolutions, but they do not allow it, saying the hardware cannot do it. I have also tried 'Detect' and other methods, as well as CRU and going into the registry. I understand that there is no reason why I cannot output a high resolution into any screen, but it would result in a poor image quality. All I want is smaller icons, taskbar, etc., more space, and I do not care about the actual pixel resolution or if I cannot even read the text under the icons.</p>
<p>My first idea was to use an HDMI emulator that would be 1920x1080 and then clone that &quot;virtual&quot; monitor, which is not physically there, to the laptop screen. Does anyone know of a way or a simple software, etc. that can help me achieve this?</p>

<p>I'm under the belief that the following is true: If I dd files from an unencrypted hdd to an (blank) encrypted hdd, that the new unencrypted files (on recipient hdd) will remove the encryption.</p>

<p>I was trying to create partitions after encrypting the hdd, but wasn't able to (using gparted); seemed that once the hdd was encrypted, that was a nogo regardless of whether I opened encryption or not in gparted. </p>

<p>I was trying to see if I could encrypt the underlying hdd, and then put non-encrypted files into the partitions. It was just a thought...</p>

<p>""sudo dd if=/dev/sdx1 bs=16M of=/dev/sdy2""</p>

<p>I don't see how I can dd files (coming from non-encryption) to an encrypted hdd without losing the encryption there, or, dd files to a non-encrypted hdd, and then encrypt those files. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>Encrypted/destination hdd was encrypted w/ LUKS the following way:
&gt; ""sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdx 
&gt; ""sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdx diskname""
&gt; ""sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/diskname""
&gt; ""sudo cryptsetup luksClose diskname""

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mounted both the ""if"" and ""of"" devices and ran the following command: </p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>""sudo dd if=/dev/sdx1 bs=16M of=/dev/mapper/diskname""
</code></pre>

<p>The files from a non-encrypted device were transferred. 
I closed the encrypted device and shut the device off. 
I then powered the device back on and opened the encrypted drive. 
The drive was still encrypted. </p>

<pre><code>Now I am trying the same thing but NOT mounting either of the devices... will update soon...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: 
Using the same 'dd' command, with the host files/ device being 16GB, and the destination NOT mounted, the host files have been copying to the destination for over an hour and are still not done. It appears that the host files are going to go over every bit of the destination hdd, whereas, when the destination was mounted, it completed the same assigned task in about 20 minutes. </p>

"1499816","Windows 10 equivalent to OSX's ⌘+D to navigate to my desktop, ⌘+Shift+H for Home, ⌘+shift+A for apps etc","<p>In finder on OSX there are shortcuts to special folders like the user's Desktop, the user's Home directory and the Applications directory (from memory it's <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> for ~/Desktop, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>H</kbd> for ~/ and <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> for /Applications, but it's been a while since I moved to the dark side, so please feel free to edit).</p>

<p>One thing that's always bugged me is that there is no equivalent for Windows. To navigate to my home folder is particularly annoying, I have to go <strong>My PC>C:>Users>stib></strong> which is way too many clicks. So is there an addon or hack that mimics the OSX behaviour? Ideally it would work in open file dialogs as well as in Explorer.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Here's what I tried with AutoHotKey</p>

<pre><code>;-- ctrl win d opens the documents dir
^#d::
send {Ctrl down}l{Ctrl up}
send Documents{Enter}
Return
</code></pre>

<p>That works in some dialogs, but not all. For example the dialog that opens with notepad++ looks like this,</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/2veMe.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/2veMe.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>and neither the <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>l</kbd> nor <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> shortcuts would move focus to the address box. So that script would send the word ""Documents"" to the name box, resulting in it creating or opening a file called Documents in whatever folder it happened to be open in. The workaround is to send the absolute path to the Documents folder, but it's still a bit brittle. If focus is moved away from the dialog for any reason (eg a notification window from another ap opening) the script will send keystrokes to random elements. Not optimal.</p>

For this, I use team viewer to connect, then copy the setup, then run it, set the installation parameters, see if everything is working fine and then delete the copied file.

<p>Now, I can ping the modem from bob, but I cannot access internet properly. Thougb internet DNS works.</p>

<p>When I try to connect to a WAN server I get: ""destination host unreachable"". I guess I have an issue in my config somewhere, or something is lacking.</p>

<p>Maybe I should configure something on the modem, I don't now. But, no, when I did the tests, I plugged the Pi router on a switch with both ifaces on the same switch at one point I was able to access the net, everything worked. After these tests, I plugged the Pi to its final location, next to the modem. Now, from machine bob to reach WAN, the route goes through a switch, two CPLs, the pi router, the modem.</p>

I've aleady contacted the manufacturer, he is sorry but I have to buy another one. But except the bios, everything works fine so I am not planning to buy a new one.</p>

<p>In order to boot on windows I have to press F11 to enter into the UEFI menu and select Windows Boot Loader. If I do not enter the UEFI I get a black screen with the message: Reboot and select proper boot device.</p>

<p>In the devices list in the UEFI menu I have some unknown devices which may cause some problems.
I can access to the EFI shell by pressing ESC when my PC starts.</p>

<p>Can I boot on my windows 10 without entering the UEFI menu ?</p>

"1508132","tried to merge system reserved partition with main and now cannot boot","<p>I had merged the system partition and main partition which is more or less structured as follows:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/YWahg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/YWahg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, the merge didn't complete.  Thankfully, the data on the data partition still appears to be intact.  However, it will not boot.</p>

<p>I had tried to go into diskpart and set the data partition to be active as described here <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/192772/what-is-the-system-reserved-partition-and-can-you-delete-it/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.howtogeek.com/192772/what-is-the-system-reserved-partition-and-can-you-delete-it/</a> to no avail.</p>

<p>I then tried to rebuild the bcd using bootrec but was getting an <code>access denied</code> message when running <code>bootrec /fixboot</code>.  I found running <code>bootsect/nt60 sys</code> helped get me past that and now I'm stuck at seeing a message saying that <code>windows\system32\drivers\atapi.sys</code> is missing.  However, when I run command line from my install dvd, I see the file right there. I was wondering how I can convince my drive to see that and presumably other files it may consider missing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the age of the computer, I don't believe the BIOS supports GPT partitions and I am stuck with using the MBR partition scheme.  A few resources I used include

<p>I've tried to practice doing this in a sandbox by spinning up a vm with windows 10 home installed and going through the same destructive process of merging and recovering, except here, the merging was successful.  At any rate, after going through the steps in the neosmart links above and then finally running ""repair startup"" or an option that's similar to that when booting into the windows 10 install dvd, I was able to recover boot capabilities.  I wasn't able to reproduce this on the original drive though.</p>

<p>One thing that might impact this is that I now recall that I assigned the drive letter to something else per instructions I read here: <a href=""https://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-bootrec-fixboot-access-is-denied-error-on-windows-10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-bootrec-fixboot-access-is-denied-error-on-windows-10</a> .  Perhaps that's why <code>atapi.sys</code> cannot be found?  How would I be able to see if there's any sort of drive letter alignment that needs to happen?  I would have figured that the path would be drive letter agnostic but rather based on the results of the windows installation I select after running <code>bootrec /rebuildbcd</code>.</p>
